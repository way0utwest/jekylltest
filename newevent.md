This page is designed to help you setup and request a new SQL Saturday event. As with the rest of the site, this is a work in progress and under construction.

There are a few simple steps to get your event set up on the site:

- Gather information about the event (see our checklist below)
- Submit this to this site
- Sign the contract for using the SQL Saturdy name

That's it. Once you have the signed agreement and the information submitted, we will update this site with your event.

Note that the contract is a temporary one with Redgate Software until the SQL Saturday Foundation is legally established.

Numbers for new events are assigned on a first come basis once the event is added to the system. Once an administrator adds a pull request for your event, the number is assigned and used for your event. Future events will get subsequent numbers. 

You can, however, name your event anything after the SQL Saturday #xxx part. For example if you want an edition, you can so something like:
- SQL Saturday #2000 - Atlanta - BI Edition
- SQL Saturday #2000 - Denver Azure Edition
- Data Saturday #10/SQL Saturday #2000 - LA
- SQL Saturday #2000 - Diversity and Inclusion Edition

You can even theme these events without a city or physical location, such as the last item in the list above.

Once you have the information for your event, please [open an issue in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/red-gate/sql-saturday-website/issues) with the title of your event. Provide the information in your issue from the checklist below.

We have a [checklist in an Excel file](#checklist) below of items you need as well as [guidance](#guidance) to help you run your event.
