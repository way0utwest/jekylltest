## Title: TempDB- More permanent impact than you think
 
**Abstract**:
As a DBA you hear different theories and "gospel truths" about TempDB from many people. Frankly there is no single version of the truth except that if you don't use and manage it well, it will make your life a real h*ll.
What works for you in one situation may not work for you in another situation. What works for a situation today, might not guarantee its success for a similar situation tomorrow.

We will talk about 
Temporary User Objects, 
Work Tables, Interim Results
Version Store for Data
Standards for its configuration
Contention
Data Files Per CPU - Myth or Reality?
Dynamic Growth or Pre Sized?
Trace Flags to Manage Tempdb?
Should we store the entire Tempdb on SSDs?
Should we shrink TempDB or not?

Hopefully at the end of the session your knowledge on Tempdb won't be Temp.

## Title: T-SQL: Tips and Tricks
 
**Abstract**:
Queries are running longer than expected? Your database server isn't performing as well as it should? There are many reason that this could be happening and one of them is the T-SQL being executed on the system. T-SQL offers various ways to get the information that you need but sometimes the option you choose might return the data that you want but may not be the best query structure or logic to use. 
This session will share insight on how basic query structure and logic works so you can avoid wasting too much time on trial and error when writing queries. It will also show you some tips and tricks to avoid some bad T-SQL coding habits and help you write better queries. This session is for Developers and Database Administrators.

## Title: Copy Data Management and Virtualization
 
**Abstract**:
As DBAs, Developers, Infrastructure professionals, CIOs and IT Directors we are straddled with multiple issues pertaining to Copy Data sprawl. 

Just imagine, it is 4:30 PM on Friday evening, you need a 10 TB database restored, thirty minutes after restore is complete, you are asked to do it again. What can you do?
In any conventional method for providing copy data, you would run into any or all of the issues of providing space, bandwidth consumption, time to complete, the lead time to complete, security, masking and the key question "Which server does this go to"?

We will also discuss the pros and cons of methods that are currently used for copy data including replication, mirroring, transaction log shipping, block level replication etc.  We will learn about "Copy Data Virtualization" a relatively new concept; and how it can help us overcome all these issues. 
We will examine what technologies/products are available that help us mitigate such a massive problem of Copy Data.

## Title: SQL Server 2016 Hybrid Scenarios
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft has invested heavily in building cloud capabilities into SQL Server. SQL Server 2016 is architected to work smoothly with the cloud in a hybrid environment that helps organizations realize the benefits of hyperscale cloud. And SQL Server and Microsoft Azure work better together because the Microsoft hybrid cloud technology provides a consistent set of tools and processes between on-premises and cloud-based environments. This means that SQL Server 2016 is designed to work in a hybrid cloud environment in which data and services reside in various locations.
 
As a result, it is now much easier to move databases to the cloud. Learn about the hybrid scenarios supported in SQL Server 2016, which include Stretch Database, Always Encrypted, faster hybrid backups and high availability, and disaster recovery scenarios to back up and restore on-premises databases to Microsoft Azure and place SQL Server AlwaysOn secondaries in Azure.
