## Title: PowerShell for Data Professionals
 
**Abstract**:
You’ve heard it said, “If you have to do it twice, automate it.” Cut the learning curve and get a real handle on this powerful automation tool. This session walks you through a dozen scripts to simplify and easily automate time-consuming and tedious elements of your day to day job. This isn’t stuff you’ll use SOMEDAY, these are scripts you can use when you get home tonight. Harness the power of Power Shell to easily find Servers short on space. Script out tables and constraints across all of your databases at once. Backup databases and restore them to a different environment. These tricks and many others will allow PowerShell to simplify your job like no other tool.

## Title: Deep Dive into Indexes (Part 2)
 
**Abstract**:
No system ever performs well even on the most powerful hardware unless the database is efficiently indexed. But what does "efficient indexing" mean? Database Professionals impress customers by use of magic buzzwords such as “Indexing strategies” and “Performance tuning” and happily contribute to the myth about complexity of the subject. But with all complexity involved it’s not Rocket Science – the key point is to understand how SQL Server works with indexes and look at them from SQL Server standpoint.  
This session dives into the internals of SQL Server and covers various topics such as index physical structure, how and when indexes are used, how to design efficient indexing strategy and perform the index tuning of the system.

## Title: Mining XML Query Plans
 
**Abstract**:
Execution plans contain a lot of information that can guide you in your performance tuning process. Since SQL 2005 it is possible to retrieve the execution plans stored in the cache using DMVs and DMFs. However, as they are stored in XML format it can be cumbersome and difficult to extract the information you need. In this session, you will learn how the XML query plan is structured and how to use SQL Server’s built-in XQuery language to extract information. Examples include indexes that the optimizer indicates would increase performance if implemented and queries that use table scans or nested loop joins.
