## Title: TFS for SQL/BI Developers
 
**Abstract**:
If you do any kind of SQL Server or BI development, you eventually have to grapple with the problem of keeping multiple copies of your work.  You either need to maintain stored procedure and DDL scripts or you have copies of SSIS and SSRS reports to keep up with.  In most cases, this problem starts off small as you need to have development versus production copies of your code.  But eventually, it becomes harder and harder to maintain your "source code" as your environment becomes more complex and as you potentially have to start working with a team of other developers.  During this session, we'll talk about Team Foundation Server (TFS) and show you the different ways it can be used to keep up with all the different types of source code you might be responsible for -- from full database designs to complete BI solutions.

## Title: Table Vars and Temp Tables – What you NEED to Know!
 
**Abstract**:
Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represents temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"

## Title: Advanced SSIS Techniques
 
**Abstract**:
As an ETL developer using SQL Server Integration Services have you ever wondered how to:
1.	Import all .csv files from a folder
2.	Replace dynamic SQL using variables in SSIS
3.	How to configure the data flow buffer
4.	Create custom logging solutions
5.	Use a script component as a data flow transformation
This session focuses on advanced techniques that are used in SSIS and is meant for the experienced SSIS developer.  We will focus on tasks and techniques that are native to SSIS 2005-2014 as well as some of the more advanced and vague  properties.  
Attendees must have a good working knowledge of SSIS as well as familiarity with VB.NET or C# as some time will be taken looking at extending SSIS with script tasks and components.
Upon completion of this workshop attendees will be able to:
1.	Import/export multiple sources/destinations
2.	Use an execute SQL task with variables to replace dynamic SQL within a package
3.	Dynamically handle errors within any part of a package
4.

## Title: SSIS: Design principles for robust ETL processes
 
**Abstract**:
Is the design of your ETL processes robust?  Does your ETL process keep you awake at night?

Data integration is still the most common point of failure of data centric projects and choosing a mature ETL tool, such as SSIS, is not enough.  In many cases this is due to improper planning and the use of questionable design principles. During this session we will look at ETL processes from a holistic point of view to identify key areas that are often neglected and that have the potential to affect the system reliability and increase its maintenance cost. We will use SSIS to evaluate key ETL architecture areas - such as re-start ability, monitoring, error handling, among others- and discuss design principles you can use to improve the architecture of your ETL processes going forward. You will find the session valuable regardless of you level of expertise in ETL.

## Title: Performance Tuning Pit Stop for DBAs
 
**Abstract**:
Our users are in constant demand of faster running servers that spill out data before they can blink. Performance can be hard to measure and improve.  Before we get in the race we will cover how to get a Performance baseline using the PAL Tools. The first Pit Stop will be to review TempDB setup to improve performance. Before getting into high gear we'll pull over to refuel on some Log File best practices and performance implications of VLFs. Finally before passing the checkered flag we'll make one more stop to talk about Data Files and improving your mileage from there. After this session you'll have a good idea of how to make changes transparent to any application to get your server crossing that finish line in style!

## Title: Get Testing with tSQLt
 
**Abstract**:
tSQLt is a testing framework that is designed to help you write repeatable, isolated tests against your database code. In this session we will briefly examine the goals of testing, where it can be used in an automated deployment pipeline, and introduce you to the tSQLt framework. We’ll show you how to design and write tests to enforce standards, check calculations and other DML operations as well as check exception handling. You will see how a real world refactoring task can be tested in a repeatable manner. Learn how you can incrementally write tests that help you build higher quality code and minimize the introduction of errors against your existing objects.

## Title: A New Approach to Unit and Integration Testing in SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
Testing is a critical part of the release process and vital to a high-quality data management lifecycle. Unfortunately, Integration Services (SSIS) does not have built-in support for testing and the tools for relational database testing are limited. As a result, most organizations forgo automated testing and focus entirely on manual user testing, which is both expensive and often occurs too late in the process to address all of the issues discovered. 

In this session, a new approach to unit testing (focusing on verifying the correctness of individual packages, tasks, or dataflows) and integration testing (focusing on validating that the data produced by an entire sequence of transformations) will be discussed. This development pattern uses metadata authored by analysts to automatically generate testing logic within the corresponding packages or to automatically generate standalone test packages that contain all of the necessary validation logic.

## Title: If You Build It, They Will Come--Creating Your Own Opportunities!
 
**Abstract**:
Often times we might feel like we are simply spinning our wheels and can't seem to move ahead.  Perhaps we see others getting opportunities and can't quite place why more doesn't come our way.  This session will discuss how we can put ourselves in the drivers seat when it comes to making opportunities so we can make some decisions about what we want to do rather than choosing from what is left.

## Title: Wheaton's Law for Technology Pros: Level up your customer service
 
**Abstract**:
DBAs (and IT folk in general) have a terrible reputation for being stubborn, jerky curmudgeons. These guys exist, and working with them is a miserable experience--but they're a minority. Unfortunately, they are a memorable minority and they give the rest of us a bad name.

It can be hard to enforce the rules, do what's best for your environment, and offer outstanding customer support. It can be tough--rules mean telling people no. Rules mean making decisions that might make some people unhappy. In this session, we'll talk about some of these challenges and how to deal with them, all while obeying Wheaton's Law.

## Title: Avoiding the Pitfalls of Database Change Automation
 
**Abstract**:
Automation and Continuous Delivery are at the forefront of software development processes today.  However, databases are being neglected because database code is different, harder to automate, and DBAs just don't seem to trust database automation. This is not surprising when you consider the number of incidents and instances of downtime that were caused by out-of-process updates, code overrides, and other database glitches. In this session, we will explain the options to automate database changes along with the benefits and issues with each option.

## Title: Dimensional Modeling Design Patterns: Beyond Basics
 
**Abstract**:
Dimensional modeling is arguably one of the most important
fundamentals of business intelligence.  It is still relevant even as
new technologies like PowerPivot and SSAS Tabular Models are becoming
more popular.  Correctly modeling your organization's data not only
protects the most important asset your company has but ensures that
your data mart or data warehouse will be responsive and capable of
accommodating emerging requirements.

This session provides a deeper dive into 
the art of dimensional modeling. We will look at the different types of fact tables and dimension tables, how and when to use them. We will also some approaches to creating rich hierarchies that make reporting a snap. Finally we will cover  physical design choices.This case study and demo based session promises to be very interactive and engaging, bring your toughest Dimensional Modeling quandaries.

## Title: What Can Data Quality Services Do for You?
 
**Abstract**:
In 2002, U.S. businesses lost an estimated $600 BILLION a year because of data quality problems. In 2012, Microsoft offered Data Quality Services (DQS) to reduce some of that loss.  DQS enables analysts to recognize data quality defects and manage business rules to correct those data defects. Once defined, those business rules are available for use throughout the enterprise in SSIS packages so the data loaded is as clean as the business-defined rules. Standardizing and de-duplicating data are no match for DQS. Join me as I profile and standardize data before your very eyes.

## Title: Understanding the Impact of Flash on SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
The concept of storing data on flash chips has been around since the late 80’s, but has traditionally been cost prohibitive in most cases.  As the technology continues to improve we are seeing much higher capacities with significantly lower pricing, so the power of flash is no longer limited to just those companies with multi-million dollar technology budgets.  This session will take a vendor-agnostic look at the different patterns for leveraging flash and what those mean for a SQL Server Database Administrator.
