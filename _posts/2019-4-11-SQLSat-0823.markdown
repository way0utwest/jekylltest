## Title: What's New in SQL Server 2019: 100% Demos
 
**Abstract**:
You haven't installed SQL Server 2019 yet, and you don't want to sit through a bunch of slides. You want to see a series of real-world demos focusing on the features of SQL Server 2019 that will make your users happier with as little work as possible on your part. You don't have time to rewrite all your queries or learn new languages - you just want the database to go faster.

I'm Brent Ozar, and I'll give you the whirlwind tour. I'll focus on just the features that make the biggest bang for the buck, things you can implement right away and see a noticeable difference. I'll show you what kinds of code will benefit the most so you can go back to the office and have an honest discussion with management about what to expect.

No slides here - not even an about-me slide. Let's dive into some queries!

## Title: SQL Server Query Performance Tuning
 
**Abstract**:
You identified a query that is causing performance issues, and your mission is to optimize it and boost performance. You looked at the execution plan and created all the relevant indexes. You even updated statistics, but performance is still bad. Now what?
In this pre-conference session we will analyze common use cases of poorly performing queries, such as the improper use of scalar functions, inaccurate statistics and bad impact of parameter sniffing. We will learn through extensive demos how to troubleshoot these use cases and how to boost performance using advanced and practical techniques.
The topics in this session are relevant for SQL Server versions 2005 through 2017. We will also demonstrate some of the new features introduced in the latest versions of SQL Server, such as Adaptive Query Processing. At the end of the session, you'll have a list of tips and techniques to apply in your environment.

## Title: What is CI/CD for databases or how to automate DB changes
 
**Abstract**:
In the world of agile software development, the database development process introduces some challenges to the application development process. The delivery of changes at database level tends to be a different and separated process of the application delivery process or even an entirely manual process. This contributes to the perspective that the database is a bottleneck in the agile process.
In this session, I will show how to build a deployment pipeline capable of delivering database and application changes. The pipeline includes the following steps: source control, continuous integration and continuous delivery. I will share methods and strategies that allow bringing together databases and applications in the delivery process reducing the delivery pain. 
The main goal is to understand that applications and databases can and should share the same deployment pipeline and that this pipeline will allow you not be afraid of making database changes.

## Title: Implementing a Hybrid Data Warehouse
 
**Abstract**:
The last couple of years have seen the emergency of "Big Data", "Cloud" and "Internet of Things". Subsequently, Gartner at the 2016 Gartner Summit in Barcelona declared the Enterprise data warehouse (EDW) as dead. Which of course is silly. Sensible companies don't just throw money out of the window. But they need to adapt and change when new opportunities arrive. Enter the hybrid data warehouse. Combining the power of big data and cloud with your trusty EDW. This session will take a look at a few different approaches to a hybrid data warehouse, with components such as SQLServer 2016, Azure Data Lake, HDInsight, Azure Analysis Services, Azure SQL Data warehouse and Polybase, with some scenarios where the approaches might become relevant. And some pitfalls you need to know about along the way.

## Title: The fact that I am an old Database Server does not mean I have no memory problems
 
**Abstract**:
Having enough memory is critical to SQL Server's performance, in this session we will try to answer some questions:
how SQLOS of SQL Server manage its memory?
SQL Server is using all of the memory available for it on the server, but is it enough? 
What could be wrong if SQL Server will have too much memory?
Why Doesn’t SQL Server Release Memory?
How to identify when the system was under external and/or internal memory pressure?
What are the RING_BUFFER_RESOURCE_MONITOR telling me?
Who is filling my memory?
How much server memory is being wasted by storing empty space?
Large-page memory (trace flag 834) could it help Columnstore indexes?
How much memory can a single session have?
What can I do with Out Of Memory error?

## Title: UTF-8 in SQL Server 2019: Theory, implementation for Hebrew, and internals level behind the scene.
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server started using Unicode with UCS-2 encoding (mapping range 0-65535, using 2 bytes). In time, support to UTF-16 added (mapping additional range up to 1114111, constructed from two UCS-2 Code Points using 4 bytes). Traditionally Unicode data types like NVARCHAR/NCHAR are marked with "National Character" N.

SQL Server 2019 introduced the Supplementary Character "_UTF8" to fully support UTF-8 under non-"National Character" Data types like CHAR/VARCHAR. UTF-8 potentially can reduce the data size dramatically up to 50%, but migrating to the new feature requires an in-depth understanding on how SQL Server store and use the data in order to prevent unwanted implications

In this presentation we will cover different string data types and Collations, supplementary characters and surrogate pairs, Code Pages, encoding (ASCII, Unicode, UCS-2, UTF-16, and UTF-8), Emoji, and more. We will dive into SQL Server internals and examine the way SQL Server store the data behind the scenes

## Title: Cloud Powered SQL Server Performance Tuning Unleashed
 
**Abstract**:
Monitoring SQL Server is a combination of knowing what you need to monitor in your environment and how to accomplish that monitoring. For most of us, we'll need a way to detect blocking, finding long running queries, discover what filegroups need more space and which jobs failed and this is just as a start. We also need a way to capture more detail of how the system is being used at both the hardware and software level and hopefully be notified before a situation becomes critical to the overall system health. 

Gather all that information, at a constant rate and keeping it long enough to understand trends - that is a challenge that was used to be handled only by expensive tools.

Join this session to learn how Quest used the Cloud power to build Spotlight Cloud monitoring solution. A fully managed, enterprise-grade tool that can do all of the above, at a price that is affordable by organizations of any size.

I've started my career as a developer, but later I've discovered that my true passion lies in data platforms of all kinds (relational and non-relational). Since then I'm a DBA, an instructor, a team leader, a consultant and an architect of data platforms for more than 20 years.
At first I was an Oracle DBA and on 2005 I fell in love with SQL Server and been using it ever since along with other platforms.

Today I work for Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and deal with a wide variaty of platforms including SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, Hadoop, Kafka and MongoDB.
