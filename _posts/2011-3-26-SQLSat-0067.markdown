##Title: SQL Server Internals:  It's What's for Dinner!##
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wondered what happens under the hood when you query your SQL Server database? Well, it’s somewhat like asking for a special meal for dinner. During this session, I will use a chef analogy to describe the life cycle of a query and the journey it takes through SQL Server’s working parts. By comparing the concepts of SQL Internals to a familiar idea, you will have a clear understanding of the underlying processes involved in returning data from a SELECT query. Once we’ve established a frame of reference for a simple read operation, we’ll look at an UPDATE statement and consider the additional factors associated with a write operation.  By session's end you should have a clear overview of what happens when a query hits your server.

##Title: What To Do When It All Goes So Wrong##
 
**Abstract**:
As IT Professionals we inevitably will see situations where everything goes wrong. At times we are somewhat lucky and this just means diminished functionality or a slow system. Other times our organization is temporarily out of business. Regardless of the scope of the issue, how we react can have a direct impact on how quickly things are returned to normal. This session will cover how to communicate issues, including what to say, who to say it to and when to say it. Part of managing communication is to get everyone into a room, forcing them to talk, so time will be spent on designing an effective war room. The session will also cover how by setting out to prove that an issue is ours we are able to more quickly get at a root cause.

##Title: SQL Server Storage: Filegroups, Files, Partitions##
 
**Abstract**:
It’s hard to find good information about SQL Server storage. Should you put data and log files on different drives when they’re on a SAN? How do you know when to add more data files? Is there an advantage to using multiple filegroups? Brent’s a former SAN administrator and wrote the storage chapter of Professional SQL Server 2008 Internals and Troubleshooting. He’s got the answers you’re looking for, and he’ll help demystify what SQL Server’s doing inside the black box. Attendees will learn why you shouldn’t add files to an existing filegroup, how to get faster performance from TempDB, and how to check your file performance using DMVs.

**Abstract**:
This presentation will highlight case studies about some of the largest SQL Server customers who are pushing the envelope with SQL Server in various ways.  This includes scalability in Database size, Transaction throughput and Replication, etc.  This presentation has been given in the past by a member of the SQL Customer Advisory Team (SQLCAT.com), Kevin Cox, who has worked with some of these large customers.  This session will effectively illustrate the capabilities of SQL Server, maybe beyond the limits you thought possible.  This will give you confidence in recommending the use of SQL Server for your most demanding workloads within your organization.

##Title: Baselines First, Troubleshooting Second##
 
**Abstract**:
“The system is slow. It was much faster last week! This is taking forever.” Statements like these from users can be frustrating for any DBA, unless you have the data to prove how the system regularly performs. In this session we will cover some of the tools and techniques freely available to SQL Server DBAs for capturing baselines that can be used for measuring performance, capacity planning and understanding usage patterns. We also discuss how these utilities and their data can be used to identify warning signs and troubleshoot performance issues. Tools covered include: PerfMon, PAL, Profiler, ClearTrace, RMLUtils, who_is_active and SQL Server DMVs

**Abstract**:
As protectors of arguably, the most important asset companies’ have we are tasked with ensuring quality, security and performance.  However the ways in which we utilize and obtain those assets are often not formalized and therefore suffer from degraded quality.  Let's discuss some strategies that can be implemented to not only raise the bar of quality, but also make you sleep easier at night.

##Title: Index Internals for Mere Mortals##
 
**Abstract**:
Most DBA's have heard of indexes, but not everyone understands how they work.  In this in-depth session, Michelle will cover the internals of indexes, including index filtering and partitioning.  She'll compare the B-trees of different index types, explain fragmentation, and use undocumented commands to show you what an actual index page looks like.  Attendees will walk away with a much better understanding of indexes, which is helpful when designing and tuning databases.  If you've ever wondered just *what* goes on in an index, this is the session for you!

##Title: The Script Task, powerhouse of SSIS##
 
**Abstract**:
Everyday more DBAs and SQL developers are given responsibility for ETL development. They have a strong SQL background with little or no .Net language programming experience. As they progress with SSIS, they can come up against perceived limitations in the capabilities of SSIS using only the built-in tasks. What they may not realize is the extensibility available to SSIS via the Script Task. This presentation will provide them with the tools they need to move beyond that perceived limitation.

##Title: Windows Failover Clustering Basics for the DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
While you can see how to deploy a failover cluster in 60 minutes, what a DBA really needs is a solid foundation of Windows to truly be able to understand that implementation and its subsequent administration. This session will demystify the Windows layer of clustering and present it from a DBA focus. Using Windows Server 2008 R2, some of the topics that will be shown are: failover cluster validation and its impact on installing SQL Server, a tour of the new Failover Cluster Manager and how it can be used for administration, using the new cluster logs for troubleshooting, and more.

##Title: Monitoring Data Changes with Change Data Capture##
 
**Abstract**:
Most modern enterprise database environments require some measure of auditing their data. Previously, the DBA would need to put together a complicated web of triggers and history tables in order to properly track data changes. Now in SQL Server 2008, Change Data Capture allows the DBA to readily enact a very straight-forward method for tracking the changes and understanding easily how they took place. In this session, we will examine how to set-up, configure, use, and administer the Change Data Capture process in your environment.

##Title: Automate Policy-Based Management using PowerShell##
 
**Abstract**:
The Policy-Based Management feature in SQL Server 2008 provides a great way to ensure your systems are configured consistently and correctly, but it can be tedious to implement on each server in your environment.  PowerShell scripts allow you to automate the implementation of your policies so you can focus on more important problems.  This session will walk you through how PBM works, how to define your policies in PowerShell, and how to set up Agent jobs to evaluate those policies regularly to let you know when you need to take action.

##Title: Do More (ETL) with Less (Effort) - Automating SSIS##
 
**Abstract**:
SSIS is a great tool for transferring data from one data source to another, and for implementing complex ETL processes. However, for simple, straightforward data transfer tasks, creating SSIS packages by hand can be time-consuming and repetitious. By attending this session, you'll learn how to automate package creation in SSIS, including the dynamic generation of data flows. We’ll cover some of the free and open source tools available for this, and discuss “roll your own” options.

##Title: Powershell: Are you checking out my profile?##
 
**Abstract**:
Powershell is a very powerful management tool and you can spend hours writing magical scripts to do all the things you want. Frequently forgotten is the Powershell profile, a place you can add your own functions which can provide you lightening fast access to information. We'll talk about the power a profile puts at your fingertips. I will also demo (and share) a bunch of short functions that I use frequently for common tasks. I'll show you my Powershell profile if you show me yours.

##Title: SSIS: The DBA multiplier##
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wanted to create clones of yourself to get all your work done faster? I will demonstrate how SSIS can help you perform your DBA tasks as if there were more than one of you. You will leave the session knowing how to use SSIS to automate tasks such as performance monitoring above (and below) the normal health checks and transporting databases from one environment to another. You will also learn how SSIS can be used in assisted HA and DR failover strategies as well as backup solutions that go beyond the simple BACKUP statement.

We’re going to take SSIS and make it a standard tool for your administrative tasks!

##Title: Find Performance Problems by Reading the Waits##
 
**Abstract**:
Start with a simple proposition: a process is either working or waiting.  You can tune the working part, but are you seeing the whole picture? There are many different resources on which your process could be waiting – a lock, memory, disk, CPU, and much more.  When a process must wait, SQL Server will log it. There are hundreds of different wait types, and they are a gold mine of data for finding and solving performance problems – and proving the changes worked.  After attending this session, you will be able to gather wait stats and use them to zero in on performance issues affecting your databases.  Stop guessing, start knowing!

##Title: Service Broker...What's That  How Do I Use It?##
 
**Abstract**:
Have you heard of Service Broker? Do you know what it is? How about how to use it? This session will answer these questions and more. Service Broker is arguably one of the least known and used features of SQL Server. We'll explore Service Broker and learn what it is and how it works. We'll walk through the setup and configuration along with demonstrating its use. You'll leave this session with a better understanding of Service Broker, its use and implementation, along with ideas of how you can implement it in your own environments.

Performance tuning is hard, everyone knows that. Attend this session and learn how to define, measure, and analyze performance issues as well as implementing changes and also how to make sure those changes continue to have the desired effects.

##Title: Self Service BI in SQL Server 2008 R2 (PowerPivot)##
 
**Abstract**:
There are many IT pros who know all the snazzy tools to create fantastic reports.  The users who know the data inside and 
out may not know those tools, but odds are that they know Excel.  Microsoft has released PowerPivot which seems to bridge 
the gap between the two worlds.  These power users can now create their own fantastic reports within PowerPivot.  We will 
explore what PowerPivot is and how can use it to create a self-service business intelligence solution.

##Title: Backups  Recovery In Depth##
 
**Abstract**:
What does the Bulk Logged recovery model really mean anyway?  Backup and Recovery are two of the most crucial functions a DBA can perform, however they’re also some of the least understood.  We’ll bust some myths and take a good look at how backups  restores really work including a comparison of recovery models, important facts about the transaction log, and tips  tricks for enhancing performance.

##Title: Index Black Ops##
 
**Abstract**:
There's a lot that goes on under the covers of SQL Server with your indexes.  But it's not as secretive as you might think.  Most of this information is made available to you through DMVs.  While this information is useful - you need a clear understanding of what is in the DMVs in order to understand what is going on.  In this session we'll take a dive into sys.dm_index_operational_stats to find out what it does and what you can do with this information.

##Title: Introduction to Developing with SQL Azure##
 
**Abstract**:
The Cloud is fast becoming the latest hot topic in the technology arena. We need to understand how we as SQL Developers and Administrators can utilize SQL Azure, Microsoft’s platform for relational data storage in the Cloud, to meet our needs. This talk will be a step-by-step demo of how to obtain an Azure subscription, create and administer a SQL Azure database, and work with it from your own SQL Server Management Studio AddIn. You’ll find that Azure is so easy to work with, you’ll get two for the price of one in this talk: you’ll learn Azure and learn how to create a Management Studio AddIn!

What kind of materials, hardware, software, etc do you need? What’s the best way to build a proof of concept that will impress your boss, as rapidly as possible?

Come to this presentation, and I’ll answer all of these questions plus the most important question of all. 

“Is this good for the company?” Absolutely.

##Title: Understanding SQL Server XML Features##
 
**Abstract**:
The XML Functionality embedded into SQL Server 2005 and 2008 is one of its most powerful yet least understood features.  This seems to be primarily because DBA's shy away from it and developers prefer to work with XML in their code.  In this session we will explore the XML features of SQL Server and how we can bridge these two worlds. Topics covered will include retrieving relational data as XML, storing XML in the database using the XML Datatype, XML indexes, and the XQuery functions included in SQL Server.  We will also look at using XML as stored procedure parameters as a way to pass large amounts of complex data between client and server.
