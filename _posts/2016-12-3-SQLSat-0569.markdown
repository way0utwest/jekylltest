## Title: The (Consumer) Internet of Things on your arm - MS Band  PowerBI connected
 
**Abstract**:
The Internet of Things (IOT) gets more and more attraction - not only on the business but also on the customer side. Connected fridges, cars and smart watches - always and everywhere connected! In this session Wolfgang will show you some possibilities of the Microsoft Band 2 SDK: how-to connect and read sensor data out of this device. But what should be done with that data? 
Power BI seems to be an ideal candidate for analyzing and presenting those kind of data. The different types of real-time analytics (Stream Analytics, Power BI API, ..) will be presented and their pros and cons will be envisioned. 
The challenge: Let's prepare a real-time dashboard of Band2 data in Power BI in 60 minutes!

## Title: Advanced BIML - for the advanced ETL developer
 
**Abstract**:
This is not your regular Agile BIML session. By now you already know that BIML is a great productivity enhancement to SSIS. You also know that you can build metadata driven solution and include C# code in your BIML scripts or snippets. If you don't know what I'm talking about this session is not for you. If you - on the other hand - want to know how to build a modular BIML framework, do real C# development and include it in your BIML code so that you can pass custom objects around for optimized performance and code reuse then this session is for you. We will see how to build a reusable C# framework that can be obfuscated and deployed to customers without worrying about Intellectual property. I promise you no more than a few slides but a lot of demos and real life experience acquired from major BIML projects. We will also have a look at how to harness integration and unit tests in the setup with a twist of Continuous Integration with Team Foundation Server.

## Title: Zombie Attack Against Clustered Indexes - Who really need them! [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
Clustered Index zombies come out of their graves to make the peace loving Heaps to one of them in your databases. Try to attack them or find a fair way to make them living together in peaceful harmony.

If you ask experts about using a clustered index you will in most cases hear the following statements: Yes, you need a narrow and contiguous clustered index for your table for good performance. Last but not least Microsoft Azure Databases requires clustered indexes but there might be situations when workloads and queries will suffer from wrong implemented clustered indexes.

Watch the demos which show in an impressive way that clustered indexes are not always the best choice. Build your clustered indexes wise or - as the demos will show - forgo for it for a better scaling. Become aware of the pros and cons of Clustered Indexes and make a wise decision when to use clustered indexes and the correct key attributes for it.

## Title: Azure Data Lake Store / Analytics 101 [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we take a look and a deep dive into Aure Data Lake, a new feature on Azure that will enable amost anyone to work with BIG DATA. It combines C# and SQL to a language that is way more intuitive than what we are used to.

Azure Data Lake Store, our new repository for data of various origins – we can collect, store and share data from this lake as we see fit. Azure Data Lake Analytics, a new way to scale and use your analytics on AZURE and BIG Data, it introduces U-SQL a new language combined of C# and T-SQL to make the task of analyzing BIG Data easier and more comprehendible. Azure Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio, provide an integrated development environment that spans the Azure Data Lake, dramatically simplifying authoring, debugging and optimization for processing and analytics at any scale. After this session, you will have an understanding of the new feature, and will hopefully be inspired to use it either in a Proof Of Concept or in a Production scenario.

## Title: Query Store: Taking control of your query performance [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
Many of us came across a situation when a query suddenly becomes slow. To understand the reason for the slowdown, it would be nice to see what was the query plan before that. Was it the same or another, if it was another, then what had changed? It was a hard to figure it out unless you had implemented your own monitoring system. Fortunately, in SQL Server 2016 we have the solution out of the box, it's called – Query Store.
Query Store is a kind of “flight recorder” for your database, it provides functionality to capture queries, plans and execution statistics in the database, more to the point it allows you to force a particular plan for a query. The session will describe Query Store functionality and capabilities, provide some Query Store internal implementation details and give several usage scenarios.

## Title: SQL Server 2016 and Polybase: Bringing Relational and Non-relational Data Together
 
**Abstract**:
This demo-heavy session will take a look at PolyBase in SQL Server 2016. This technology provides the means to access and combine both relational and non-relational data all from within SQL Server. Using the wonderful T-SQL language you are already familiar with, you can run queries using T-SQL against data that resides in Hadoop, HDInsight, or Azure blob storage. This session will show how to use T-SQL to import and export data back and forth between relational tables and non-relational data stores. We'll also show how to join and aggregate data from both SQL Server and a non-relational store using T-SQL and how these queries are optimized to push computation down. We'll also look at how to configure and scale out SQL Server PolyBase for those high-volume workloads.

## Title: Kerberos for BI [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever seen this message quot;Login failed for user ‘NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGONquot; ?
Have you ever witnessed Kerberos mentioned in a conversation - or in a forum - and seen developers shiver, sysadmins crawl back under their rock and project managers fear for the consumed hours ?
Have you ever wondered why it seems so complicated ?
If you answered yes to any of these question then this demo-packed session is for you.
Because Kerberos is something that anyone who must deploy SQL Server wishes they didn’t have to worry about. It truly affects all aspects of SQL Server including the engine, Reporting Services, Analysis Services, SharePoint and PowerPivot. Furthermore we will have a close look at how to diagnose problems and troubleshoot the three-headed beast when it breaks loose.
This session is based on many hours spent sweating in setting up Kerberos in BI and SharePoint environments and explaining support people how to troubleshoot and fix Kerberos issues when they a

## Title: Creating Custom BI Solutions with Power BI Embedded [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft Power BI Embedded is a Microsoft Azure that enables developers to integrate Power BI reports into their web or mobile applications so they don’t need to build custom solutions to visualize data for the users. 
Microsoft Power BI Embedded helps Independent Software Vendors to use Power BI data experiences within their applications. Customers, who use applications with Power BI Embedded don’t need to have a Power BI account or to know anything about this Azure service. 
This talk is a practical session on Microsoft Power BI Embedded concept with many examples how to create custom BI solutions using this technology.

## Title: FILETABLEs: What They Are and How to Use Them [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever had the need to access documents in your database as if they were files in the file system? SQL Server 2012 introduces a brand new method for managing large data objects (BLOBs) in a database. FILETABLEs provide access to data using Transact-SQL - just like any other table inside the database, while at the same time also provide access to the data using the operating system File I/O API - i.e. just like any other folder in the file system. In this session you will learn how to upgrade your document management solutions by migrating your large data to FILETABLEs. The session covers two most typical migration scenarios: migrating from a distributed data store, and from a homogeneous data store.

## Title: Explore Dark Data with SQL Server 2016 and R [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
With the addition of R into SQL Server 2016, Microsoft have provided a few extra degrees of freedom for the standard SQL developer. You can now use the R language to wrangle, clean and collect external data, using libraries and functionality that simply wasn’t available to you before with regular T-SQL. Performing data enrichment at scale with SQL Server or even Microsoft R Server can provide extremely valuable new insights for your clients and start reaping the benefits of big data.

In this session, Consolidata’s Oliver Frost shows you how to develop your own application for tapping into ‘dark data’. Ollie will demonstrate how to stream live tweets, perform aggregations in R and pipe the output to a Power BI dashboard, giving you a full end-to-end experience of the importance of learning some basic R code in 2016. 

This session is for anyone who is new to R and is interesting expanding their skill set beyond their comfort zone in SQL Server.

## Title: CLR  T-SQL (in real "online gaming" life) [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
T-SQL has some limitations, which can be partially overcome by using CLR. That extends power of your database in directions you might not be even aware of. Like a bonus you get solid performance, testable and reusable code, similarly maintainable like a regular application code. But everything reliably secured inside of your database.
The potential of CLR capabilites is huge.  I will show top patterns and tip  tricks we encountered during the last couple of years when we we were developing on-line game backend.

## Title: Know What Your Code is Doing to SQL Server! [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
ORMs - oh how I LOVE them! As a consultant when I see them in play at a client I go KACHIIINNNNGGGG!! :-D Seriously though, they can provide some substantial benefits for coding throughput. But if you don't Read The Fine Manual and do some things right and avoid some major gotchas you will fall prey to one of my favorite Guruisms: "Anything that allows developers to slap code together more quickly is inversely proportional to the performance and scalability you will get from that code"! Although this talk is based on Entity Framework, most ORMs suffer from a lot of the same flaws.
