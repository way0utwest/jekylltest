##Title: NSA Secrets - Hacking SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
How easy is it to hack a SQL Server?
In this session we'll see a few examples on how to exploit SQL Server, modify data and take control, while at the same time not leaving a trace.
We'll start by gaining access to a SQL Server (using some creative ways of making man-in-the-middle attacks, and other ways), escalating priviledges and tampering with data at the TDS protocol level (e.g. changing your income level and reverting without a trace after payment), and more.
Most importantly, we'll also cover recommendations on how to avoid these attacks.
This is a demo-driven session, suited for DBAs, developers and security consultants (Jedi level).
Disclaimer: No actual state secrets will be revealed. Please do not send agents to my house again.

##Title: Bashboard Delight with Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
Delivering eye-catching insight has now become almost ludicrously easy. You just fire up Power BI and …
Wait a second. Yes it is has never been easier to add the “wow” factor to presentations based on data. However there are still techniques, tricks and traps that you need to know if you are going to leave your audience impressed with your insights rather than drowning in your data.
This session takes you through the use and limitations of all the visualizations that come out-of-the-box with Power BI, as well as a quick tour of many of the custom visuals that are now available. You will see which type of delivery is best suited to which kind of data. You will also learn how best to structure and adapt the Power BI data model so that it can feed into the different visualizations for maximum effect.

##Title: Making Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking work for you!##
 
**Abstract**:
Azure SQL DB has had Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking for a while now, SQL Server 2016 brings that on-premises. But just how can you use it, what changes do you need to make to your model to get the most from it?

These new features have the potential to really improve application security, especially in compliance scenarios. Pushing the security restrictions down into the database layer has many benefits, notably only the data needed leaves the database. But there are a number of gotchas that you need to be aware of that can really mess up performance if you get them wrong.

In this session we will look at how you can get the most out of these features and retain the performance of your system.

##Title: Powerful T-SQL Improvements that Reduce Query Complexity##
 
**Abstract**:
We’ve all dealt with nightmare queries: huge, twisted monsters that somehow work, despite being ugly and unmanageable. The time has come to tame these beasts, and the solution is available now, in SQL Server 2012.
New T-SQL functions offer out-of-the-box solutions for many problems that previously required complex workarounds. Paging, Running totals, Moving aggregates, YTD, and much more comes at the power of your fingertips in SQL Server 2012. The only thing you need to do is learn the syntax. And that is exactly what this session is all about: a thorough description and explanation of the syntax, and loads of demos to demonstrate how you can use all these new features.
Attend this session to boldly take SQL Server where it has never gone before!

##Title: From SSMS to SSDT why and how to move your SQL database development to SSDT##
 
**Abstract**:
SSMS is the love child of what was Query Analyzer and Enterprise Manager and has ever since been used as the dev tool of choice for people creating and modifying database schemas and code. Whilst SSMS is a really good management tool it is not suited to modern development. Instead Microsoft has created SSDT (SQL Server Data Tools) which has had a lot of attention from Microsoft in the last few years which means that it is now ready for us to use full time.

We will cover:

* How to get your databases into SSDT and critically how to get them to compile correctly.
* A tour of the SSDT features that show how T-SQL development is actually easier and how SSDT makes you more productive
* The build  deployment process so you can start concentrating on writing useful code instead of upgrade and release scripts.

If you write, debug or modify SQL Server database code and haven't yet started using SSDT full time then this session will help you get started and be productive quickly.

##Title: Automated Database Developmer Testing##
 
**Abstract**:
Oscar Wilde once said "We are all in the gutter, but some of us have unit tests" and it is as true then as it is now - databases hold code and if you want to:

- Make changes faster
- Improve the quality of your code
- Provide guaranteed examples that are proven to work

Then you should look at database testing but what is database testing? What are unit tests? Integration tests? Acceptance tests? How do you get started and keep going with automated testing?

In this session we will answer these questions and give examples of how to test database code and some of the challenges you will face along the way.

Whether you are completly new to developer testing or have been been "a mocking and asserting" in c# or java for years this session will get you started writing tests for your database code.

##Title: Deep Dive on the IoT Hub##
 
**Abstract**:
When you design IoT solutions in the Azure cloud there are some things you are going to need to do.  Being able to send events to a resilient queue that can handle millions of transactions per second is fine but what do you do about security?  Surely you only want registered devices to be able to send to that queue?  What about storing details about those devices too?  Maybe we want to be able to tell where a device is located, its model and serial number.

IoT solutions very often are not a one way street.  Having devices send their data to the cloud is great but often you need the cloud to talk back to your device.  
OK so our data is in the cloud but now what?  What do we do with it?  What can we do with it?

This session is going to show you how to solve all of these things.  It is going to be heavy on demos and will build the solution in stages so nobody gets lost.  We'll use a mixture of technologies all of which are available in Azure.

Come to the session to learn more.

##Title: Getting CI right for SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
This isn’t the dark ages any more. You’ve learned that you need to put your database in source control and you’re competent with source control systems like TFS or Git. You’ve also learned how to express your database in script form using a tool like SSDT, Flyway or Redgate.

However, you still haven’t written as many automated tests as you know you should and you aren’t convinced you’re going about it the right way. You haven’t really looked at the build functionality in VSTS yet or gotten to grips with build servers like TeamCity or Jenkins, and even if you have you aren’t sure how the process should work for SQL Server builds and tests.

In this session I’ll explain how to use tSQLt to build a suite of automated tests to give you confidence in the quality of your code. Then I’ll talk through various ways to automate your database builds and run those tests on some schedule or trigger. I’ll also discuss the pros and cons of various different approaches so that you can understand

##Title: Monitoring SQL Server, Everywhere, With SQL Sentry##
 
**Abstract**:
Want to get the best out of your SQL Server systems? Then you really ought to monitor them! 

With the rise of Cloud, with hosted virtual machines and Azure SQL DB, adding to the mix of on-premises physical and virtual machines, having one tool that can give you this single view is vital. 

Monitoring enables you to understand where you have pain points and allows you to make the most out of these disparate systems. With SQL Sentry tools we can monitor every type of SQL Server wherever it resides; AWS Virtual Machines, Azure SQL DB, in your Datacenter, or  hosted in Rackspace.
               
Join us as we help you understand what, and how SQL Sentry can help you get the most from your SQL Server Data Platform, wherever it is.

##Title: Investigate TempDB like Sherlock Holmes##
 
**Abstract**:
The system database TempDB has often been called a dumping ground, even the public toilet of SQL Server. (There has to be a joke about spills in there somewhere). In this session you will learn to find those criminal activities that are going on deep in the depths of SQL Server that are causing performance issues, not just for one session, but that affects everybody on that instance.

##Title: Getting started with PowerShell - the hands on 101 session##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will cover off the different elements that make PowerShell a language that is built upon making itself easier to discover.
We will cover Functions, Aliases, Help Topics, Modules, Cmdlets, Objects, Methods and Properties and how understanding these different aspects makes your time in PowerShell much simpler to get to grips with and can really help you adopt the language in a much more efficient way going forward.

This session should leave you with a greater understanding of the PowerShell Language and give you the ability to go and discover more of the language and how it works.

##Title: The current state of Powershell DSC for DBAs##
 
**Abstract**:
Powershell Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a declarative configuration management system.
Most DBAs are probably using unattended installs followed by a bunch of post configuration scripts make sure our SQL Server instances are production ready.
We will take a look at how Powershell DSC works, and how this can be used by DBAs to install, configure and manage SQL Servers.
We will try to answer questions like:

How does Powershell DSC work
How would a DBA use Powershell DSC
Are the resources to manage SQL Server mature enough

After this session you are better equiped to decide if Powershell DSC is useful for you, now or in the near future.

##Title: Think  work like a Data Scientist with SQL 2016 R##
 
**Abstract**:
What are these DATA Scientists up to? How can we see their statistical model in our day to day familiar tool like Microsoft SQL Server?

You now have answers to these questions and thanks to Microsoft for integrating R Revolution within new SQL Server 2016. We all now have the opportunity to use R packages and see the results within SQL 2016.

In this session, you will definitely take away a breakthrough concept of Advanced R Analytics within SQL 2016 and get ready to kick your creative horse, and go beyond your imagination on how you can build advanced analytics and impress your employers/customers.

The methodology was documentend by Microsoft in a white paper not much later and has grown in popularity ever since. This presentation will introduce you to this methodology and introduce some of the most common wait types that you are likely to see on your own systems.

##Title: Normalization Beyond Third Normal Form##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you believe the myths that “Third Normal Form is good enough”, or that “Higher Normal Forms are hard to understand”?
Do you believe the people who claim that these statements are myths?
Or do you prefer to form your own opinion?
If you take database design seriously, you cannot afford to miss this session. You will get a clear and easy to understand overview of all the higher Normal Forms: what they are, how to check if they are met, and what consequences their violations can have. This will arm you with the knowledge to reject the myths about higher Normal Forms. But, more important: it will make you a better designer!
