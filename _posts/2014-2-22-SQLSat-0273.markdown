##Title: Statistics and Query Optimization##
 
**Abstract**:
There are any number of tricks and traps around getting the query optimizer to provide you with an optimal execution plan that gets you your data quickly and efficiently. But, at the end of the day, the principal driving factor of the optimizer, and therefore of your queries, are the statistics that define your data. This session teaches you how those statistics are put together and maintained by SQL Server. Different types of maintenance results in different levels of accuracy within statistics so we detail what the structures and information looks like after this maintenance. Your understanding of how the optimizer works with statistics will better enable you to understand why you’re getting the performance and types of execution plans that you are getting. Understanding enables you to write better t-sql statements and deal with performance problems such as bad parameter sniffing.

##Title: Discover, Document,  Diagnose Your Servers on Your Coffee Break##
 
**Abstract**:
Documentation is the bane of every DBA's existence. We all know we should do it but it's time consuming; by the time you're finally done it's probably out of date. Throw in the new servers you just found out about last week and keeping documentation up to date can turn into a full time job. And with everything we have to do in our day, who has time for that?

You need a way to work smarter, not harder, and automate your documentation. It can be done, and in this session you'll learn how to discover all the SQL Servers on your network, document their configuration from top to bottom (including OS details), and diagnose common problems before they turn into big headaches - all while you're on a coffee break. You'll look like a rock star without writing a line of code on your own or having to ask management to sign a check.


Attend this session and walk away with everything you need to generate documentation for your entire SQL Server environment on your first day back at the office

##Title: Unit Testing SSIS Packages##
 
**Abstract**:
Unit testing is a widely accepted best practice, yet it is difficult to do well with SSIS packages. This session will focus on both the practice of test driven development as it applies to SSIS, and the tools for actually implementing it. It will cover in depth how to set up your development environment to support test driven development and what techniques can be used to make this practical for SSIS. You will also see how to automate the testing of SSIS packages, using the open source ssisUnit framework. The session will cover several of the common questions about automated unit testing, including how to handle test data , how to set up the environment for multiple developers, and how to make tests flexible.

##Title: Database Development Comes out of the Dark Ages##
 
**Abstract**:
Database development has traditionally been done using SQL Server Management Studio query window as the primary tool, when far more powerful tools are available in your toolset. This is the equivalent of writing a document using Notepad, when MS Word is available on your desktop. This session will take you through some of the basics of using SSDT, show you how to use VS2012 database projects effectively, how to utilize TFS build, test and deploy your code. I've had my share of bumps on the road to deploying these toolsets. At the end of this session you will have a good introduction into how to use the tools and how to avoid some common issues with legacy code you are already have in your environments.

##Title: Introducing Cube World To Users From Flat Table Land##
 
**Abstract**:
This session explores the tabular approach to building cubes in SQL Server Analysis Services 2012 for those DBAs and developers who are more comfortable working with relational databases than cubes. Starting with a ‘normal’ relational database, the attendee will learn how to build a basic model by loading data from several data sources, establish relations between these data sources, define measures and dimensions, build hierarchies, create KPIs and deploy functional cubes that can be used to answer management’s questions about what is really going on with their data. For users already familiar with PowerPivot, this session provides a good transition into the world of SSAS as both use essentially the same techniques.

##Title: Can't we all just get along?##
 
**Abstract**:
There comes a point in every career that you will need to talk to people that you do not agree with.  It is important to advancement (and well-being) that you are able to make concise points that will draw interest from other teams, as opposed to alienating them.  
How do you speak to your leadership team?  Your peers?  People who depend on you?  People on whom you depend?

##Title: Trimming Indexes Getting Your Database In Shape##
 
**Abstract**:
Indexes are a wonderful thing.  We should be using them, and we should be maintaining them.  But over time our production databases start to look a little pudgy around the mid-section.  Maybe they are a little bloated with Unused Indexes, maybe they have Duplicate Indexes, and possibly even Reverse Indexes.  The first step to fixing these problems it so see if you have them, and if you do the second is to set about fixing them. You could be costing yourself CPU cycles, I/Op’s, and space and never even know it.

##Title: SQL Server Amnesia: Diagnosing Memory Problems##
 
**Abstract**:
Amnesia is caused by injuries, traumatic events, or physical deficiencies.  Memory problems in SQL Server can also be classified using these same terms.  This session will take a deep dive into memory internals in SQL Server by covering the SQLOS and the differences in memory allocations in SQL Server 2008 and SQL Server 2012.  This session will focus on common patterns and problems that affect SQL Server memory usage and how to solve them based on real-world scenarios. From incorrectly sized hardware to code and schema design challenges that tax SQL Servers memory usage, this session will give you the tools necessary to tackle even the most challenging memory problems.

##Title: Manage SQLServer Efficiently w/PowerShell Remoting##
 
**Abstract**:
You have more and more servers to manage and less time to accomplish everything. You're writing scripts to automate those tasks but they still take time to run. PowerShell remoting allows you to manage servers without the overhead of Remote Desktop, and allows you to run processes on all your servers simultaneously.  In this session we'll walk through how PowerShell remoting works, how to set it up, and how you can save time getting things done more quickly.

##Title: You Inherited a Database, Now What?##
 
**Abstract**:
You have recently inherited the support of a new or existing database, what are the things you should immediately check and start monitoring and what are the things that you should address over the next few weeks. When taking over support of a database or system, you cannot ASSUME anything. At the end of this session you will have a nice checklist of things you should check and be doing on ALL your databases not just the one you inherited. Whether you are a seasoned DBA or just starting out, this session should be informative and something you can relate to.

**Abstract**:
Attendees will learn how to define a permission set with a single script that allows your company’s DBAs to do routine work and how to elevate DBA permissions quickly to respond to production emergencies. 
DBAs will leave this session with an easy to implement, low hassle solution that provides DBAs the minimum necessary access required to maintain the server but not be able to view user data. 
In addition, I’ll talk about our DBA’s real world experience with reduced permissions

**Abstract**:
Are you storing or planning to store credit card numbers? If so, you need to learn all you can about the requirements for PCI compliance. We'll cover how PCI works from the requirements to the final audit, and eveything in between that you'll need to know something about. We'll talk about encryption, key management, logging, alerting, administration access, granular permissions, tokenization, and as much more as we can fit into an hour. It's a complex topic, but that just makes it more interesting!

##Title: Loading a Data Warehouse with SSIS##
 
**Abstract**:
You've just been assigned a data warehouse project. Maybe you've figured out what tables you want to work with, but outside of that you don't really know how to get started. In this session we'll cover some of the basics of data warehousing, and then we'll show how to use SSIS as an ETL tool to load a Kimball data warehouse.

##Title: Squeezing Top Performance from Your Virtualized SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
Just about anyone can click through a SQL Server installation and get it working, but more than a little  tuning is required to get the most performance out of your servers. Once virtualized, additional tuning can help get even more performance out of that virtual machine. David Klee (@kleegeek) will discuss valuable details for both VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V on how to tweak and tune your virtual infrastructure for business-critical virtualized SQL Servers. Tips on configuring your SQL Server installations for maximum performance when virtualized will be covered in detail.

##Title: Translate SQL server performance issues into business costs##
 
**Abstract**:
DBAs understand their bottlenecks, managers understand business issues, this presentation will help both sides understand each other and how to put a dollar figure in business terms on your performance problems.  Putting actual costs to problems allows the business to determine if it worth fixing and allows the DBA to obtain budget to move their environment forward.

##Title: Windowing Functions in SQL Server 2012##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2012 brings with it nearly full ANSI compliance with the windowing functions. Come to this code filled session to learn about all of the windowing functions in SQL Server 2012: Ranking functions, changes for windowing in the Aggregate functions, and the new Analytic and Sequence functions. We’ll examine how this latest implementation of the windowing functions allows us to perform running and sliding aggregations; retrieve data from adjacent rows in the partition, and much more – all without self-joins back to the source table.

##Title: Database Design: Size DOES Matter##
 
**Abstract**:
Great database performance starts with great database design. During the database design process it is important to select your datatypes wisely. The wrong choices will often lead to wasted space, increased response times, and less stability. Additionally you run the risk of having your design not scale as well as it should. Leave this session armed with the knowledge you need to help your databases perform at their peak efficiency.

##Title: Big Data - HdInsight and Parallel Data Warehousing (PDW) ##
 
**Abstract**:
We will define Big Data first. Then, we will talk about Microsoft's two offerings:  HdInsight and Parallel Data Warehousing (PDW).  HDInsight is Microsoft’s new Hadoop-based platform. It combines the simplicity of Windows with the power and reliability of Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) to deliver big data insights from Apache Hadoop. PDW is a shared nothing massive parallel processing (MPP) relational DB based on SQL Server. This Session will explore how to load data to the Azure blob store, creating an HDInsight Service cluster, adding additional storage locations, and adding structure with Hive objects.
