##Title: Devs are from Mars, Report Servers are from Venus##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you remember what it was like to fall in love? Wasn't it wonderful?

Lately it just hasn't been the same. You've been stuck in the same old routine, doing the same old charts and tables. Maybe Reporting Services doesn’t tell you what’s wrong. Maybe you're even thinking about seeing other reporting products. Maybe you and RS just weren't meant to be together.

In this session, Doug will re-ignite your passion for RS by showing you how to design for better performance, explaining what RS has been trying to tell you through logs (but you haven't been listening), and demonstrating some new -- and easy -- tricks you may not have known RS can do. After this session, you'll want to spend some time alone with your new old flame.

##Title: The Tally Table: What it is/how it replaces loops##
 
**Abstract**:
Don’t let the “Intermediate” rating scare you “Beginners” away.  This “Black Arts” session is for anyone that uses T-SQL. There are dozens of things we do in SQL that require some type of iteration. "Iteration" means "counters" and "loops" to most people and recursion to others. To those well versed in the techniques of "Set-based" programming, it means some form of a "Numbers" or "Tally" Table, instead. SQL Server MVP Jeff Moden takes the mystery out of how this wonderfully compact tool works and how it easily replaces many types of loops. This session has been updated to include additional information about what “Pseudo-Cursors” are and how they work as well discovering why “Recursive CTE’s” can be your worst enemy.

##Title: You’re My Density: Making Sense of Statistics##
 
**Abstract**:
The Query Optimizer uses statistics to decide how to execute a query.  If statistics are out of date, improperly sampled or simply don’t exist, then you could unintentionally deceive the Optimizer. Accurate statistics can help avoid poor query plans, so if you’re not familiar with how to read a histogram, the various options for updating statistics or want to know why sample size does matter, this session is for you! We will also delve into what happens when a value doesn’t exist in a statistic, discuss methods to manage statistics for volatile tables and examine the challenges that exist with statistics on partitioned tables. Expect a session filled with demos and real-world examples that will create a foundation of statistics knowledge.

##Title: Cross Tabs  Pivots: Converting Rows into Columns##
 
**Abstract**:
Don’t let the “Intermediate” rating scare you “Beginners” away.  This “Black Arts” session is for anyone that uses T-SQL.   SQL Server MVP Jeff Moden demonstrates and explains simple methods for converting gobs of “vertical data” into horizontal numeric and textual data by date or other key using Cross Tabs and Pivots.  This session includes the “Black Arts” method of “Pre-Aggregation” for incredibly high performance and how to dynamically and automatically produce reports based on a date.  The methods learned in this session can be used to provide “dynamically pivoted” result sets to SSRS, Crystal Reports, and other reporting software.

##Title: The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects##
 
**Abstract**:
Taking the periodic table of elements into consideration I've created The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects as a reference tool for these functions and views that have become so critical for today's SQL Server DBA to performance tune and gain metadata insights into their various SQL instances. 

In navigating the table we will examine key DMVs and DMFs of interest: requests, sessions, wait stats, indexes, system information will all be covered. We will also delve into how these DMOs - just like their elemental counterparts - can be combined to yeild interesting insights into your servers. We will also look at how things can go awry as well! Like mixing vinegar and baking soda, sometimes combining DMOs can cause a big mess too!

##Title: Visualizing Your Indexes - Science behind the Art ##
 
**Abstract**:
Indexes make queries run faster, right? Not always, no. And finding the right indexes for your needs is often more of an Art than a Science. Attend this session as we take a visual tour of how indexes are laid out and the way data is accessed when indexes are utilized. We will discuss clustered indexes as well as non-clustered indexes and also when to use indexed views along with some other variations.

##Title: Read Dirty to Me - Understanding Isolation##
 
**Abstract**:
Issue a "SELECT {data} FROM {myTable}" statement and users need to trust the data returned is accurate. What happens when multiple processes access the same data? What happens further if one of those process is an UPDATE or even a DELETE statement? How about if both processes will be updating that data? Understanding Isolation in SQL Server is paramount in ensuring data integrity in your system. We will cover the different levels of isolation and how they impact what a user views when accessing the data at a given point-in-time.

##Title: Seven Strategic Discussions About Scale##
 
**Abstract**:
Know those apps that need a complete rewrite from scratch, but management won't listen to you?  Kendra Little has been there and she's figured out how to frame the big conversations. She'll give you seven strategies to improve scale and change application architecture, and explain concepts from sharding to caching along the way. You'll get a toolkit for each conversation: how to gather the right supporting data from the environment, who to talk to, and how to speak the right language to drive each change.

##Title: T-SQL : Bad Habits to Kick##
 
**Abstract**:
Bad habits: we all have them. SELECT * is the obvious one; but in this session you will learn about various other habits and why they can be bad for performance or maintainability. Come learn how these habits develop, what kind of problems they can lead to, and how you can avoid them. Eliminating these habits will lead to more efficient code, a more productive work environment, and - in a lot of cases - both.
 
**Speaker(s):**
- Aaron Bertrand

I also make spending time with my wife and 2 kids, attend a local PASS user group and enjoy life!

##Title: What's New in SQL Server "Denali"?##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server "Denali" delivers many highly anticipated features that some feel are long overdue. In this session you will get a first-hand look at many of these new features relating to the engine (contained databases, AlwaysOn, and T-SQL enhancements), client tools (Management Studio, Books Online, and "Juneau"), and changes to setup and system requirements. You'll also learn about some of the features that will not be making it into Denali, and deprecated functionality that will stop working in this or the next release.

Doing proof of concept projects and pushing the limits of technology are the passions in my professional life. Many people do projects just because they are assigned to them, but I like to ask questions like "who, what, when, where, why, how and how often". Finding the answers to these simple inquiries saves not only me, but the people (and teams) around me time, money and resources.
I also make spending time with my wife and 2 kids, attend a local PASS user group and enjoy life!

##Title: Automate Policy-Based Management using PowerShell##
 
**Abstract**:
The Policy-Based Management feature in SQL Server 2008 provides a great way to ensure your systems are configured consistently and correctly, but it can be tedious to implement on each server in your environment.  PowerShell scripts allow you to automate the implementation of your policies so you can focus on more important problems.  This session will walk you through how PBM works, how to define your policies in PowerShell, and how to set up Agent jobs to evaluate those policies regularly to let you know when you need to take action.

##Title: Monitoring Databases in a Virtual Environment##
 
**Abstract**:
When moving databases to a virtual environment the performance metrics DBAs typically use to troubleshoot performance issues such as O/S metrics, storage configurations, CPU allocation and more become unreliable. DBAs no longer have a clear, reliable view of the factors impacting database performance. Understanding the difference between the physical and virtual server environment adds a new dimension to the DBA tasks. This presentation describes the changes that DBAs need to make in their performance and monitoring practices.

**Scott Schommer** 
Doing proof of concept projects and pushing the limits of technology are the passions in my professional life. Many people do projects just because they are assigned to them, but I like to ask questions like "who, what, when, where, why, how and how often". Finding the answers to these simple inquiries saves not only me, but the people (and teams) around me time, money and resources.
I also make spending time with my wife and 2 kids, attend a local PASS user group and enjoy life!

##Title: TempDB Performance Troubleshooting and Optimizing ##
 
**Abstract**:
Every SQL Server instance relies on the tempdb database. Whether through explicit use with #temp tables or @table variables, or implicit use through working space for many other operations, most tempdb databases get quite a workout. This session will dig into many of the otherwise-hidden issues that can kill server performance. After this session, you will be able to spot tempdb performance issues, drill into the causes, and take the steps necessary to solve them.

##Title: NoSQL-What is it and why do I care? ##
 
**Abstract**:
NoSQL (or, more correctly NoRel) is a moniker applied to a family of non-relational software systems for storing data that powers some of the largest sites on the Internet. Amazingly enough,  non-relational database technology has been around a very long time. This session will include a high level discussion of some of the pros and cons of this technology compared to traditional systems like Oracle and SQL Server; as well as a survey of the most popular "NoSQL" platforms and who uses them. We will also cover a brief history of relational and non-relational databases as it is germane to the topic

**Scott Schommer** 
Doing proof of concept projects and pushing the limits of technology are the passions in my professional life. Many people do projects just because they are assigned to them, but I like to ask questions like "who, what, when, where, why, how and how often". Finding the answers to these simple inquiries saves not only me, but the people (and teams) around me time, money and resources.
I also make spending time with my wife and 2 kids, attend a local PASS user group and enjoy life!

##Title: The Creepy DBA, How to Stalk Your Users##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you know when your users are using the production login accounts from their workstations?  Are you aware of changes being made to the development servers that may impact future deployments?  Has the new Junior DBA start giving out access like candy?  As DBAs, we are responsible for knowing and acting on all of this and much more.  Fortunately, SQL Server provides a number of features that you can use to monitor and track user activity.  In this session, we’ll look at these features and demonstrate how you can use them to the extent that your users find you creepy!

##Title: Leaving the Windows Open##
 
**Abstract**:
Computing running totals, averages by state or group, and other complex aggregations are not easy to implement in many relational databases. Thankfully, many relational databases include support for window functions. Window functions are an extension to the ANSI SQL standard. More than just another part of SQL, window functions enable complex ranking, ordering, and other aggregations over a subset of rows in a query. Understanding the capabilities of window functions lets you extend application functionality, build rich and complex queries, and reduce overhead in the application tier.
