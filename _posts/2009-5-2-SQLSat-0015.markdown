## Title: XML Features in SQL 2005
 
**Abstract**:
XML in SQL 2000 wasn't very exciting and it was easy to dismiss it altogether by just relying on developers to handle any XML needed within the application. SQL 2005 changes the game and this session will show you how to use the new XML data type, do basic XML operations on XML data, and showcase the changes to FOR XML that make it so much more useful. This isn't a session to convince you to use XML, but to show you what you can do with XML if you do need to use it!

## Title: The Truth About Disk Performance and Configuration
 
**Abstract**:
Would you buy a million dollar race car then show up to the track on a clear day with rain tires that aren’t properly inflated and wonder why you’re only doing 180 when the manufacturer says it can do 220? Your answer was probably close to something like "Of course not!". Now let’s suppose that your million dollar race car is really your DB server and your tires are your hard drives. Do you know the right configuration to use to get the best performance out of them? Sure, there's RAID 1, RAID 10, and RAID 5 but do you know which combination of partition offset, RAID stripe size, and allocation unit size to use? This session will answer those questions by looking at the results of extensive testing performed against local disks and DASD encl

## Title: RESTful Data
 
**Abstract**:
REST is an architectural style that allows for a layered, scalable, and cacheable enterprise information system. With ADO.NET Data Services, a database can be surfaced to a service as a REST-style resource collection that is addressable with natural URIs and can be interacted with using the usual HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

This session will describe RESTful Data, the benefits it conveys, and its uses. Then we will set up a data service using an existing database that developers would then access rather than accessing the database directly.

**Brandie Tarvin**
 
Database Administrator by day and Author by night Brandie Tarvin sails pirate-populated waters, fights evil robots in disguise and turns kingdoms into chaotic rebellious city-states all while coding ETL processes and protecting real-world data from corruption. If it weren't for her, someone else would have the job and where would be the fun in that?

Brandie's first computer experience was with a State-of-the-Art Commodore 64 brought home by her father, who informed her that "computers are NOT toys" and would not let her use it until she learned how to program. In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville. She has published several articles on SQLServerCentral.com, trains her co-workers in SQL Server, and has previously presented at several SQL Saturday events and JSSUG meetings. She also writes fiction and freelances for Catalyst Game Labs in her spare time.

I've written thousands of stored procedures, functions and triggers and a few hundred DTS packages.  I have about 3000 posts on Microsoft’s SQL Server MSDN forums -- most of these posts related to transact SQL.  I received MVP awards in 2008 and 2009.
