## Title: Partition Magic: Metadata and Partition Switching
 
**Abstract**:
There are many reasons for partitioning your data and indexes in SQL Server, and one of those is because moving data in and out of a partition can be more efficient than any other type of data movement. This is because the way SQL Server keeps track of the internal storage of partitioned data allows data to be moved as a metadata only operation. In this session we’ll look at the metadata for table, index and partition storage to explore exactly what happens when a partition is moved. Looking at the internals of partition storage will also allow us to understand the reasons for some of the restrictions on how and when partitions can be moved, and allow us to design our data movement processes most efficiently.

## Title: UDFs, or: How to kill performance in one easy step
 
**Abstract**:
User-defined functions in SQL Server are very much like custom methods and properties in .Net languages. At first sight, they seem to be the perfect tool to introduce code encapsulation and reuse in T-SQL. So why is this feature mostly avoided by all T-SQL gurus?
The reason is performance. In this session, you will learn how user-defined functions feed the optimizer with misleading and insufficient information, how the optimizer fails to use even what little information it has, and how this can lead to shocking query performance.
However, you will also see that there is a way to avoid the problems. With just a little extra effort, you can reap the benefits of SQL Server and still get good performance.

## Title: Troubleshooting SQL Server with PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
It is normal for us to have to face poorly performing queries or even complete failure in our SQL server environments. This can happen for a variety of reasons including poor Database Designs, hardware failure, improperly-configured systems and OS Updates applied without testing. As Database Administrators, we need to take precaution to minimize the impact of these problems when they occur, and so we need the tools and methodology required to identify and solve issues quickly. In this Session we will use PowerShell to explore some common troubleshooting techniques used in our day-to-day work as s DBA. This will include a variety of such activities including Gathering Performance Counters in several servers at the same time in async mode.

## Title: Running SQL Server 2012 on Server Core: Why  How
 
**Abstract**:
Security and Performance are always two of the top issues for SQL Server DBAs.  Until recently the cost of the Operating System was something that you had almost no control over, but with SQL Server 2012 (Denali) you now have the option of running on the Core edition of Windows Server.  While Core edition has been used primarily for infrastructure servers like Domain Controllers and DNS servers, SQL Server 2012 now brings support for running the database engine on it.  This session will talk about when you may want to consider running SQL on Server Core and will guide you through the task of installing and configuring your server when you no longer have most of the Windows configuration tools that you may be used to.

## Title: SQL Azure vs. Azure Tables –Clearing The Confusion
 
**Abstract**:
The Azure platform is quickly gaining momentum and acceptance, in part due to the relational database capabilities of SQL Azure as well as the inexpensive and high-capacity storage capabilities of Azure Tables. Yet, there seems to be some confusion as to why and when you would use SQL Azure vs. Azure Tables. One is relational, and one is not, yet there has been a tendency to use Azure Storage Tables as a replacement for SQL Azure, with poor results. This session will provide a deep look at the difference between SQL Azure and Azure Storage Tables, and show the performance differences when querying each. We will look at how each stores data and the pros and cons of using each as a storage mechanism, and discuss how and why you would choose.

## Title: Quickstart BI: Building a BI Solution in 5 Days
 
**Abstract**:
A Quickstart BI project is a 5-day engagement where we start with a set of real business data and then fast-track a solution using Microsoft BI tools like PowerPivot, Power View, BI Semantic Tabular Models, Multidimensional SSAS, SSRS, SharePoint, PerformancePoint and Excel Services.  Getting real business value in a few short days of investment is tricky.  We’ve done several of these for different organizations and learned some interesting lessons about tool choices, design best practices and project scope management.  Some of these projects were throw-away proof-of-concepts but many of them became the foundation for production-ready, decision-support solutions and executive dashboards.

## Title: Exploring the TSQL Enhancements in SQL Server 2012
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2012 adds many new enhancements to TSQL. Learn how to use the windowing functionality of the OVER clause to create sliding aggregation. Find out about the new SEQUENCE object and when you should or should not use it to replace an IDENTITY.  Learn the IIF function and CHOOSE function to replace a common simple CASE functions.  OFFSET / FETCH will be covered to show you how to eliminate cursors or CTEs for data paging.  With CONCAT you have an easier time building strings in your TSQL statements independent of the data type, and without concern over nulls.  With these and other new TSQL enhancements you will be able to take full advantage of the power of TSQL in SQL Server 2012.

## Title: Unleashing Common Table Expressions in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever wanted to create a recursive query, but didn't see how to do it. With the Common Table Expressions class you will learn everything needed to start using CTE's for recursive queries, as temporary views, and to use the result set multiple times in the same query. Learn how simplify query syntax using CTE's. One of the most overlooked features of SQL Server is the CTE which not only simplifies the query, but gives you the ability to do things that would otherwise be impossible (or at least very challenging) with SQL Server.  Learn how recursive CTE’s perform better than other methods to create hierarchical results.  See how CTE’s compare to SQL Server 2012 offset and fetch paging techniques.

## Title: Power View: A Peek Behind the Curtain
 
**Abstract**:
Power View is the new data visualization and self-service BI tool that will debut in SQL Server 2012. To successfully roll-out this technology to your user community, you need to understand its architecture and data dependencies. Come to this session to get past the razzle dazzle that most Power View sessions offer, and peek behind the curtain to learn how to properly configure your environment to support Power View and how to prepare data for user consumption within Power View .

## Title: Taking BI to the Next Level: Collaboration
 
**Abstract**:
Self-service BI is usually an independent activity. But when individuals discover interesting information that they want to share, they need a centralized location to do that. When people work together, new insights are possible, and that’s what collaboration is all about. As more people see the benefits of the solution, they become more likely to use it. As individual products, SQL Server 2008 R2, SharePoint 2010, and Excel 2010 expand your options for enabling BI in your organization, but collectively they create a solid platform for collaborative BI. Knowing which tool to use for which job can be tricky. Come to this session to learn how to use these tools to foster collaboration.

## Title: Extend Your Knowledge with Extended Events!
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Extended Events can be used to gather a wide range of performance information, and in troubleshooting in SQL Server.  Extended Events use less system resources and provide better information than SQL Profiler and they allow for correlation of SQL Server event data along side of OS or Application event data. This presentation will explore what Extended Events are, how to set them up and use them in several case studies.

## Title: Query Plans and Indexes in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Data access can be easy to set up in your applications with wizards and ORMs, but sometimes your queries are just not as fast as you think they should be – especially on those tables that are getting bigger and bigger. In this session, we will take a peek under the hood and see how SQL server answers the questions you ask of it. This is an introductory session, but it will be jam-packed with demos and useful tips that you will be able to use to make your applications more responsive.

## Title: Do SQL XML queries have to scare me?
 
**Abstract**:
I have seen days of amazing C# XML library coding work replaced by 2 lines of a FOR XML statement in SQL. Built into SQL is the power to make XML do pretty much whatever you need it to. Learn how to use the XML data type and built-in XQuery functions. You will also see how to join (or “bind”) a SQL table to an XML stream to produce a single result set.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 
## Title: Introduction to the XML source
 
**Abstract**:
XML is all over the place.  But how do you get that data into SQL Server?  SSIS provides an XML Source, but it is not easy to use.  In this session we will handle increasingly complex XML documents.  After an introduction to using the XML Source with a single set of elements, we will look at how to work with multiple element sets.  This includes hierarchically structured XML documents.

Attendees will be able to import simple XML using SSIS.  They will be able to create import routines that pull data from different elements of more complex XML.  They will understand the role the XML Schema plays in defining the XML data they import.

## Title: What’s Simple About SIMPLE Recovery?
 
**Abstract**:
There is a common misconception that SIMPLE Recovery means no logging, and this is a very dangerous myth to propagate. SQL Server does log database changes in SIMPLE Recovery, but some (not all) operations are minimally logged. In this presentation, I'll tell you what minimal logging means in conjunction with each of the three different recovery models. In addition, I’ll describe the benefits and dangers of the SIMPLE Recovery Model.

## Title: Transactional Replication Beginner to Expert
 
**Abstract**:
Learn what use cases you can use transactional replication for and then dive in to tuning and troubleshooting techniques that can work for all replication types. We will cover best practices for DB and drive setup and the use of custom agent profiles. See examples of custom monitoring emails so you don't have to watch replication monitor all the time.

## Title: Top Features of SQL 2012 Nobody Told You About
 
**Abstract**:
This isn't the same old AlwaysOn demo that everyone else is doing. This is the stuff that almost nobody is talking about, but they are very important features that will save you time, frustration, and even money. These are the top features of SQL Server 2012 that you may not even be aware of. Come learn about these really cool features and see them in action.

## Title: Advanced Indexing
 
**Abstract**:
So you know all about heaps, clustered indexes, and nonclustered indexes, but are still not satisfied? Then this is just the session for you!
Hugo will explore advanced features such as included columns, indexed views, and filtered indexes. You will find out how they are stored on disk, and how SQL Server uses them to satisfy queries. Then, you will see the tools SQL Server itself hands you to help identify just the right subset of indexes. And finally, you will get an stunning demonstration of just how bad you can hurt performance by following all those recommendations and creating too many indexes.
