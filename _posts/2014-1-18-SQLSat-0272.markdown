## Title: XML Without Xanax: How to Handle XML in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Do you cringe whenever you have to look at an XML document? Does the very thought of XML data living in your database make you scream? Do you have a panic attack any time you have to parse XML? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this session is for you!

We'll start with reasons why having XML in SQL Server might be a good thing, then we'll face our fears and turn tabular data into XML, and finally we'll confront the true source of our anxiety by parsing XML back into tabular data using xQuery.

If you survive this session, you'll have faced your fears about XML in SQL Server, you'll have a solid understanding of creating XML from tabular data, and you'll know how to use xQuery to parse XML.

## Title: Visual Analytics with HDInsight and Power View
 
**Abstract**:
BIG DATA!  There, I've said it.  But, what exactly does it mean for YOU?

This session will help to dispel some of the Big Data confusion.  This session will focus on HD Insight, Microsoft's Hadoop based implementation.  Loading data and querying a database is one thing and that will certainly be covered. Exploring how we can integrate data from HD Insight into our existing analytic solutions is one of the real world implementations this session will be focused on.  This is one of the keys to successfully selling management on the needs for a Big Data solution. It's not just another database, it's a tool to enhance existing analytic structures.

During this session, we'll start with a brief overview of Hadoop and HDFS. Next we'll take a look at HD Insight, and explore some of the features therein.

Finally, integration with SSAS and Power View (using Excel 2013) will be shown, which will close the loop on Big Data visualizations.

## Title: Manageable SSAS Deployment Strategies
 
**Abstract**:
When it comes to making changes to your production Analysis Services databases, do you simply open the SSAS DB in SQL Server Data Tools (or BIDS) and click through creating the changes? Does this method lead to problems keeping everything in sync and the right changes deployed to the right environment at the right time? Have you, the BI developer, had to fight to get Production access to do your own deployments?

If you've answered "yes" to any of these questions, and are in search of a better way, I have the solution! In this demo-heavy session, will look at five steps to more robust, controllable, and flexible Tabular and Multidimensional SSAS deployments.

## Title: Entity Framework: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Learned to Love Developers
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have applications in your environment that don't use SQL written by a person but by the application itself? No, the system isn't self-aware. Chances are the system is utilizing Microsoft's Entity Framework.

Entity Framework (EF) and other object relational mapping technologies have been a boon for developers. But is Entity Framework a technology that developers should even be using? In this session, we'll review what Entity Framework is and how it's changed over time. We'll also dive into how Entity Framework works and what to look for when inspecting a database generated by Entity Framework. Finally, we'll review T-SQL generated by Entity Framework and give some tips on how to improve performance. If you're a data professional that manages databases that are accessed through Entity Framework or would like a basic knowledge of how Entity Framework works this session is for you.

## Title: Database Development Comes out of the Dark Ages
 
**Abstract**:
Database development has traditionally been done using SQL Server Management Studio query window as the primary tool, when far more powerful tools are available in your toolset. This is the equivalent of writing a document using Notepad, when MS Word is available on your desktop. This session will take you through some of the basics of using SSDT, show you how to use VS2012 database projects effectively, how to utilize TFS build, test and deploy your code. I've had my share of bumps on the road to deploying these toolsets. At the end of this session you will have a good introduction into how to use the tools and how to avoid some common issues with legacy code you are already have in your environments.

## Title: SANLess Clustering on the Ground and In the Cloud 
 
**Abstract**:
I'll tell you how to create a cluster to protect SQL Server in environments where traditional shared storage clusters are impractical or impossible. For example, I’ll show you how to create a cluster using local high performance SSD and Flash-based PCIe storage for faster SQL application response times and high availability protection and I’ll discuss how to use native SQL Failover Clusters in the Amazon Cloud. You will also learn how you can build a cluster that eliminates the cost and single point of failure risk of SAN storage.  Topics covered: - How to create a cluster using local high performance storage to accelerate SQL Server without sacrificing availability - Benefits of AlwaysOn Failover Clustering vs. AlwaysOn Availability Groups - Availability options of SQL Server Standard Edition vs. Enterprise Edition - How to add high availability and disaster protection to your SQL Server Amazon EC2 instances

## Title: You Inherited a Database, Now What?
 
**Abstract**:
You have recently inherited the support of a new or existing database, what are the things you should immediately check and start monitoring and what are the things that you should address over the next few weeks. When taking over support of a database or system, you cannot ASSUME anything. At the end of this session you will have a nice checklist of things you should check and be doing on ALL your databases not just the one you inherited. Whether you are a seasoned DBA or just starting out, this session should be informative and something you can relate to.

## Title: Know Your Role(s)!
 
**Abstract**:
Developers and DBAs naturally butt heads with each other over permissions since developers want to be able to fix their code and research issues, but DBAs are the gatekeepers.  Robert Verell will discuss Microsoft recommended best practices for setting up users and service account permissions.  He will go over common server and database roles and what they actually allow, including roles that should be avoided as potential security loopholes.  He will also look into alternatives for elevated database roles, and easier ways of setting up users across an enterprise environment, all as part of how to consolidate your development servers into fewer instances.

## Title: Read Dirty to Me - Isolation Levels/User Impact
 
**Abstract**:
Issue a "SELECT {data} FROM {myTable}" statement and users need to trust the data returned is accurate. What happens when multiple processes access the same data? What happens further if one of those process is an UPDATE or even a DELETE statement? How about if both processes will be updating that data? Understanding Isolation in SQL Server is paramount in ensuring data integrity in your system. We will cover the different levels of isolation and how they impact what a user views when accessing the data at a given point-in-time.

## Title: Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
Much of your ETL process flow consists of packages that are very similar in structure, capturing data from a single source and transferring that to a single destination.  Creating the individual packages can be tedious and it's easy to miss something in the process of generating the same basic package over and again.  BI Markup Language makes it easy to build new packages, and PowerShell makes creating the BIML scripts easy.  In this session we'll show you how to use PowerShell to generate dozens of SSIS packages doing similar tasks from a defined set of ETL sources.

## Title: Introduction to BIML and BIMLScript
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft has provided some great tools for creating and editing SSIS packages.  First Business Intelligence Development Studio (BIDS) then SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT).  However, when creating an SSIS package you frequently repeat the same steps over and over.  BIML is an XML markup language designed for representing the structure of an SSIS package.  BIML Script takes that structure and generates an SSIS package.In this session we will use BIDS Helper to create a simple SSIS package using BIML.  We will handle a couple SSIS scenarios with BIML and BIML Script.

## Title: Using Compression to Improve Database Performance
 
**Abstract**:
Back in the old days, compression and databases was a really bad idea. Now, with powerful CPUs we can use to both improve performance and save disk space. We will cover the basics of how all compression and deduplication works, and then we will learn how SQL Server page and row compression work, and the special compression that is used in SQL 2012 Columnstore Indexes. We will demo performance and space savings in using compression.
