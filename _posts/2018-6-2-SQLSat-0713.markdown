## Title: Hybrid Distributed Architecture with Azure Data Sync 2.0
 
**Abstract**:
For a number of years, Azure Data Sync was stuck in "preview" mode in the old classic deployment model and with no updates on functionality over that time many thought that it was destined for the scrap heap. However with the recent revival and port to the Azure Resource Manager model it has become a viable option for organisations looking to deploy applications that are partially SaaS but with on local on-premises component.

This session will show how one organisation has used Azure Data Sync to allow for centralised management of point-of-sales terminals across multiple retail groups. The session will discuss the SaaS based component built on Azure SQL Database to segregate different retail groups into dedicated databases. From this design the retail group's dedicated management database can then use Data Sync to gather sales and stock metrics from each terminal and push down price changes to selected groups of stores.

## Title: Real-Time Analytics with Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI helps you build appealing visualizations of your data. With ever growing footprint of data it is equally important to get real-time insights into your data. It can be as simple as monitoring a single metric or viewing real-time sales performance across multiple locations. Power BI real-time streaming enables you to stream data and update dashboards in real-time. Any time sensitive data can be a source of streaming data set like IoT sensor devices, social media sources, service usage metrics etc.

In this session 
1. I will dive deep into real-time analytics with Power BI.
2. How to build streaming tiles in Power BI Dashboards.
3. Demo using Power BI REST APIs.
4. Demo using Azure Event Hub and Azure Stream Analytics.

## Title: Machine Learning with SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Thinking about getting involved with Machine Learning(ML) and are unsure what it can do?  This session provides answers the question: Where can ML can provide a solution?  As it is important to understand the limitations of ML, the course also reviews when other analytic processes would work better. Learn the steps to ensure that your data is suited for ML analysis and what you can do to fix it.  Once attendees understand the workflow, the course will cover the processes used in algorithm selection.  We will implement ML solutions in both R and Python to show the strengths and limitations of each in SQL Server 2017.
Session Goals
•	Understand the Machine Learning development process including data analytics and algorithm selection
•	Learn why to use either R or Python given the task being performed
•	Know how to implement a machine learning solution as part of database solution in SQL Server

## Title: Dive into the Query Optimizer - Undocumented Insight
 
**Abstract**:
This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.

## Title: BI is a Journey, Not a Destination
 
**Abstract**:
With analytics becoming a buzzword in the recent past, everyone seems to want it in their businesses. Known as business intelligence for a long time, it helps an organization’s various decision makers take better business decisions using the insights that is provided. However, the path to a successful business intelligence implementation was always hounded by failure – The main reason being that BI is conceived as a one-time-implemented packaged solution, whereas business intelligence is in reality a journey.
This session will focus on how you could develop a business intelligence solution by taking the organization on an evolving journey, using the various Microsoft tools and technologies at different stages.

## Title: Data Privacy and the Data Professional.
 
**Abstract**:
It’s almost a daily occurrence to hear about some sort of data breach. 
But what are the consequences of a data breach – for both the victims and companies involved – and what does that mean for you as a data professional.
As governments start to legislate more in an effort to protect the privacy of its citizens the entire concept of data storage become more complex.
Exactly what is legislation like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and how will it affect around the world.
We’re seen Microsoft give us tools over the years – like Transparent Data Encryption and Dynamic Data masking - to help with this sort of thing – but is there a better answer?
Come along to this session and hear how you and your team can lessen your chances of being the ones responsible for the next data breach.

## Title: Test Driven Development in SQL Server – how to deploy code safer
 
**Abstract**:
Test Driven Development (TDD)  is a design approach which has enabled application developers to write cleaner code. 
It is relevant for database development as it ensures that code produced using TDD and unit tests will be of higher quality which means interactions with data will be safer. 
TDD is not a new method of unit testing, it is an essential design practice for improving the quality of your deployed code.
In this session it will be shown how we can use TDD to design and write better unit tests using open-source frameworks and industry standard tools. These tools can be run within SQL Server Management Studio which means DBAs can also take advantage of TDD and unit test, to ensure more reliable code is deployed to databases. 
TDD can result in code that can be deployed more reliably and faster when using DevOps processes such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. 
A comprehensive DEMO will reveal how Test Driven Development can help you deploy database code safer.

## Title: DBATools! The reason to finally start learning and using Powershell
 
**Abstract**:
Powershell has been part of Windows for > 10 years and has been part of SQL Server since 2008.
In spite of this the adoption among Database Professionals for use in investigating and managing their environments has been low.

With the release of the open source DBA Tools module from DBATools.IO, with its 300+ commands, the time has arrived for Database Professionals to embrace PowerShell and upgrade their skills to support the modern Hybrid environment.

In this session we will look how to download, install and begin using the power within both this module and Powershell.

No prior experience with Powershell required!
