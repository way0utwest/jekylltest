##Title: Performance Pitfalls from Code Reuse##
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever found yourself deconstructing endless layers of nested code? Is your T-SQL codebase written in an object-oriented format with functions  views?  Did you know that object-oriented code reuse can come at a significant penalty?  

Come to this session and learn why applying object-oriented principles can be extremely detrimental to your T-SQL's performance. You will learn how T-SQL is not like other common programming languages. We will peek inside the Query Optimizer to see how it handles these scenarios. Through extensive demos, we will explore solutions to maximize performance. You will be introduced to a T-SQL tool that will aid you in unraveling nested code. Alternate design patterns will be shown to help you mitigate these performance pitfalls.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Enterprise Row Level Security in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL DB##
 
**Abstract**:
The need for organizations to provide Row Level Security (RLS) in their applications is increasing every day, often in existing applications where code changes are not easy. Microsoft has addressed this need in SQL Server 2016/Azure SQL DB with predicate based RLS.  


This session will show how organizational  asset hierarchies are leveraged together to provide predicate-based RLS on tables in SQL Server 2016/Azure SQL Database without application changes. This session will go beyond the basic RLS setups and show a real-world production setup of RLS using a small number of security records to secure large and small organizations. 


Attendees will leave with a complete working demo they can take to their work and begin to use immediately. The demo will walk completely through creating the database, creating the application tables and security related tables, loading demo and security data, setting up the RLS and testing the RLS using Power BI as a test application.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: How to successfully virtualize critical SQL servers##
 
**Abstract**:
Many enterprise organizations have already virtualized most of their non critical applications, these organizations are now employing a "Virtual First" policy, harnessing the efficiency and cost savings of virtualization for their most critical applications. 
Still, many IT architects and DBA's are hesitant of virtualizing their SQL workloads, they are worried about  performance, scale, availability and support for what is usually considered their most critical applications.  
In this session we will review the guidance for successfully virtualizing critical SQL databases, we will cover the best practices, real world customer experience  and what to watch out for when virtualizing the most critical SQL databases. The session is delivered by the same person writing the official SQL on VMware best practices guides.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Many – to - Many: Multiple Calendars in a Single Analysis Services Multidimensional Cube##
 
**Abstract**:
Including the fiscal calendars of major customers within the date dimensions of their own cubes has great appeal to many organizations, including financial services firms and the like. After all, having customer calendars in their cubes' date dimension means sales and marketing managers can analyze - and report upon - data according to the fiscal calendar of the customer, as well as within the context of their own. In this session, Microsoft BI Architect, Data Platform (SQL Server and BI) MVP and SSAS Maestro Bill Pearson leads an examination into a way we can accomplish this by implementing a SQL Server Analysis Services "many-to-many" dimension scenario.   This session applies, in most respects, equally to Analysis Services (MultiDimensional) 2008R2 and above.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Power BI Data Governance - Protecting Business Data##
 
**Abstract**:
This session allows companies to think about the security and architecture of their Power BI deployment. Power BI is self service analytics. Users are quick to create a group work spaces without any thought. IT and organizations need to design a business friendly architecture that protects the business data without impacting the users ability to build their reports and dashboards. Users are also quick to change the data model or report without thinking of the negative impact. A strategy for delivering the changes needs to be put into place. This prevents presenting invalid reports or dashboards during the development or advancement stage of updating reports and dashboards.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Save code changes on your SQL Servers with Event Notifications##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you love unknown changes?  Missing indexes?  Empty reports? Unless you have a rigid change control process, finding the culprit isn't easy! You need a list of changes, and you're probably going to have to play detective to get it, looking through change tickets, wikis, log files, or even asking coworkers. SQL Server offers this capability in many forms, but the best for larger environments is a feature called Event Notifications. While you can save code and configuration changes locally, for maximum effect you can send changes from across your environment to a centralized location in real time.  

Additionally, with it you gain other abilities, like real-time monitoring of deadlocks, warnings from SQL Server's errorlog, failed login attempts, datafile growth and more.  You can automatically provide change reports to your auditors, even add the changes to source control. Get ahead of the technical curve and go from reactive to proactive!

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: End-to-End Troubleshooting Checklist for SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
Learning how to detect, diagnose and resolve performance problems in SQL Server is tough.  Often, years are spent learning how to use the tools and techniques that help you detect when a problem is occurring, diagnose the root-cause of the problem, and then resolve the problem.  

In this session, attendees will see demonstrations of the tools and techniques which make difficult troubleshooting scenarios much faster and easier, including:

• XEvents, Profiler/Traces, and PerfMon 
• Using Dynamic Management Views (DMVs)
• Advanced Diagnostics Using Wait Stats
• Reading SQL Server execution plan 

Every DBA needs to know how to keep their SQL Server in tip-top condition, and you’ll need skills the covered in this session to do it.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: In-Memory Indexes:  The rest of the story!##
 
**Abstract**:
This session is a continuation of my in-memory table presentation given at 8 SQL Saturdays in 2016 only now concentrating on in-memory indexes.  This session will do an in-depth dive into hash, range, and columnstore indexes in the in-memory environment.  It will be about 30% presentation and 70% demos with emphasis on when and how to apply in-memory indexes for stated environments/scenarios.  
After this session you will
1.	 Understand the three in-memory index types, how to create, and when to apply them for selected scenarios
2.	Be able to identify performance gains over equivalent disk back tables/indexes
3.	Comprehend the new data monitoring needed for in-memory tables/indexes

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Execution Plans for Mere Mortals##
 
**Abstract**:
For beginning database professionals, execution plans can be intimidating. This 1-hour session takes you through the basics of reading graphical execution plans and drills into key operators, warnings, and properties. Learn how, why, and when an execution plan is created and saved to plan cache. 

Reading execution plans becomes much less intimidating as we walk through the flow and process of a graphical execution plan. After looking at the key operators, you will be able to analyze the operators of your execution plans, view the operator properties, and identify common performance-tuning opportunities. Finally, you will be able to capture the execution plan and save it for analysis and comparison after modifications.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Data Architecture 101##
 
**Abstract**:
This presentation is a quick introduction for the DBA or developer who was just told that their boss promised a major new customer a scalable, well designed database. The customer will pay a lot of cash and years of ongoing business using this database… If you deliver it this week!

You’ll get a big bonus if you build this right, but you also remember what your co-workers did to the person who bungled the last database design… and wonder if that designer ever recovered! This session will introduce you to the fundamentals of Datatypes, Relational Algebra, and Normalization to help you avoid the major pitfalls and maybe get some sleep too!

This presentation is a survey of Data Architecture for the Intermediate DBA, it is not intended for experienced Data Modelers.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: SQL Server 2012  2014 ColumnStore Indexes##
 
**Abstract**:
Come and learn how the new SQL Server 2012 feature, ColumnStore Indexes, can parallelize your Data Warehouse aggregations. I will be doing a deep dive into the inner workings of ColumnStore indexes; how they work, key characteristics, dos and don'ts, restrictions, and more. I will have some insight into how CSI's have been updated in SQL Server 2014, as well.
	If you are a production DBA who needs to find out more about some of the additional hot features that have been included with CSI's, like batch mode processing and data segments, then this session is for you. If you are a BI DBA or developer who needs to find out how CSI's can increase the performance of your aggregations and star-joins by up to 40 times, then this session is also for you.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Top 5 SQL Server Mistakes##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a popular and powerful relational database system. It's easy to install with just a few clicks. Create a database, and you are in business. It will run great without much attention...until it doesn't. It's true that your shop may not have enough SQL Server instances to require a full time DBA, but SQL Server still needs some love and attention to perform its best. Attend this session to learn about knobs that need turning and more to get the most out of SQL Server.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks; Tame the Sibling Rivalry##
 
**Abstract**:
Like parents having to break up a fight between battling siblings, SQL Server must do the same for conflicting transactions. We call these Deadlocks and they can present a problem to many DBAs. Deadlocks can be minor fights or major issues making SQL Server continually choose a side like constantly quarreling siblings.

To understand how Deadlocking occurs, we must understand what caused the fight . Learning about basic locking and blocking of SQL Server is a great place to start.

By the end of this session you will walk away with the knowledge of how the locking/blocking mechanism works, the basics of deadlocking, and what Isolation Levels are . You will know how these can help or hurt your situation.  Finally you will have the power to capture, report, and stop the family fighting.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Let Me Finish... Isolating Write Operations##
 
**Abstract**:
OLTP databases can be constantly written to and reporting databases are written to at least periodically. In order to ensure consistent results, connections must be isolated from one another while executing, ideally with the lowest possible cost to concurrency.  How this isolation is handled is based on the isolation level, whether the classic lock based or the newer optimistic scheme of the in-memory OLTP engine is used, or even if both engines are enlisted in the same transaction. In this session we will look at examples of how SQL Server isolates reading and writing operations from other writing operations to explore how this may affect your application through error messages and performance hits.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Understanding and Handling Database Corruption##
 
**Abstract**:
Database corruption is simply a fact of a DBA's life - if you haven't seen it yet, you will. Success or failure depends on having a solid plan to deal with different types of corruption. In this session, we will discuss usage of related DBCC commands such as DBINFO, CHECKDB and PAGE. You'll learn how to monitor for corruption with SQL Agent Alerts and Jobs, and when it's time to restore instead of repair. After attending this session, you will be able to check for issues such as page corruption or data purity problems, and take the appropriate measures to deal with them.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Partitioning for Perf and Mgmt of Large Tables##
 
**Abstract**:
Managing data in ever-growing transaction and history tables can be challenging. Activities with large chunks of data such as moving data to archive tables, batch-importing many rows, or defragging an entire table when only the active portion changes introduces heavy I/O and blocking. Table partitioning solves a host of headaches with minimal effort. Ever wanted to truncate or defrag part of a table, or insert an entire staging table of data into another table in milliseconds instead of hours?  Come see what partitioning can provide for you.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Very Large Databases in your future##
 
**Abstract**:
Your databases may not be terabyte-sized yet, but they're probably growing every day. We'll look at lessons learned 
from working with multi-terabyte, very large databases (VLDBs) in the real world. Topics include storage layout 
decisions, unique tuning challenges, HA/DR implications, and database restores, along with shoehorning backups, re-
indexing and DBCC checks into itty-bitty maintenance windows. As a bonus, many of the techniques also apply to smaller databases and consolidated servers that run hundreds of databases.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Discuss Your Career (Panel)##
 
**Abstract**:
As a database professional, you have plenty of choice in your career path. Should you stay at the same company for 20 years, or change every few years? Much depends on what matters most to you. Do you want higher income, regular work hours, training, vacation time, group insurance, job security, lots of travel, telecommuting, or the possibility to advance to management?  The panel will give their observations and experience over decades of experience. Discussion will include at least one person who has spent over 19 years with the same employer, one person who has changed careers very recently, and everyone in attendance who is willing to give an opinion.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Building a Data Warehouse for the DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
Users want Data Warehouses built, but no one ever builds one for the DBA. Let#39;s fix that!

Get information from Active Directory, your Windows Servers, SQL Servers and other sources that mean something and will help you to keep the databases running smoothly. Be able to see which disks/machines are low on disk, what databases are on which SQL Servers, when backups happened and if any jobs failed.

This is targeted at the DBA who is responsible for multiple SQL Servers, in multiple places, and doesn#39;t have time to quot;point and clickquot; their way to a comfortable understanding of the moving pieces on all of the systems that they need to monitor!

NOTE: This session covers how to BUILD the warehouse, how to collect information and store it in relational tables in a way that makes sense as a warehouse. I#39;m developing a follow on session that presents the collected data using BI tools.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: ETL Architecture for Real-Time BI##
 
**Abstract**:
For decades batch processing has been the defacto standard for Extract Transform and Load.  For most of that time 24 hour data refresh cycles were accepted as part of Business Intelligence solutions and developer skill sets have long dependent upon the reliable patterns of batch. In recent years, however, demands have begun to shift. New use cases in every industry are now causing leading edge BI solutions to demand much shorter time to realizing value. The old architecture, skills, and tools are proving insufficient to meet this demand. In this session we will look at the fundamentals of architecting real-time BI solutions, including the new categories of problems for which we will now have to solve.  Upon completing the session attendees will have a clear picture of the new skills and patterns that must be learned in order to excel in the next phase of Business Intelligence evolution.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Getting Started with SQL Server Replication##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server replication is an excellent way to keep a subset of data synced with another database for reporting, audit, or recovery purposes.  In this session we will examine terms, internals, and walk through the setup of transactional and snapshot replication so you can utilize it as a valuable tool in your toolkit.  We will also examine some ways to make replication perform better as well. This session is targeted towards database administrators who have little to no experience with replication and developers looking for different ways to duplicate data for reporting or data consumption.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: SQL and VMware - more than just virtualization demos##
 
**Abstract**:
The demos in this session have been developed to illustrate a few key capabilities of VMware vSphere and VMware NSX that can be used to enhance the overall SQL Server implementation. As a true platform of virtualized hardware, vSphere should be considered the premier platform on which to implement SQL Server. Features such as vSphere vMotion, vSphere HA, Distributed Resource Scheduler and Fault Tolerance are complimentary to all the features and capabilities of SQL Server and create an unparalleled combination of the world’s top RDBMS and the world’s most complete and effective virtualization proposition. With network virtualization NSX can provide security enhancements unachievable with any other technology and can streamline SQL server deployment automation processes. Please join us for this demonstration of advanced vSphere and NSX feature functionality and an explanation as to how this enhances your SQL Server environment.”

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Tips and Tricks for the SSIS Catalog##
 
**Abstract**:
With the introduction of the SSIS Catalog in SQL Server 2012, we can now manage our SSIS package execution and monitor performance and logs in a much easier manner than executing packages from the file system.  In this session, we'll walk through setting permissions for SSIS read-only access, executing packages from T-SQL or stored procedures, viewing the logs generated during a package execution, writing custom messages to the logs, and many other tips to make your use of the catalog easier!

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: SS2014/2016 In-Memory Tables --Formula One Performance Unleashed, Part 1##
 
**Abstract**:
Query performance is what it is all about.  SQL Server 2014 now has the new in-memory functionality that takes a completely different approach to data access and manipulation.  This session will consolidate the relevant information from all these sources so the production DBA/Developer will be able to understand, create, use, maintain, and trouble-shoot in-memory table functionality.  This session will also examine several demo scripts showing performance gains using the in-memory tables with and without columnstore indexes over equivalent disk based tables.  
This session is all about when and how to apply in-memory tables in a production environment.
After this session you will
1.	 Understand what in-memory tables are and how to create and maintain them including their limitations
2.	Be able to identify performance gains over equivalent disk back tables
3.	Comprehend the new data monitoring needed for in-memory table

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Understanding Transaction Isolation Levels##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server offers several isolation levels beyond the default "READ COMMITTED".  But understanding when to use each one can be daunting.  Whether you are a developer who needs to understand how isolation works and  and why NOLOCK is not an appropriate hint in most cases, or a seasoned DBA who needs to understand the less commonly used isolation methods, this session is for you.  We will look at each level, how it impacts the engine, and examine appropriate (and inapproriate) use cases for each.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: A Key to Keys##
 
**Abstract**:
So many of us have learned data modeling and database design approaches from working with one database or data technology. We may have used only one design tool.  That means our vocabularies around identifiers and keys tend to be product-specific.  Do you know the difference between a unique index and a unique key? What about the difference between RI, FK and AK? Do you know if your surrogate keys have their companion alternate keys?  Do you know about weak versus strong keys?

In this session we’ll look at the generic and proprietary terms for these concepts, as well as where they fit in the data modeling and database design process.  We’ll also look at implementation options in SQL Server 2016 -- what works, what really doesn't work, and what mistakes are commonly made in implementing keys.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Autonomous Transaction Logging in SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
Autonomous/nested transactions are available in other database products, but are not natively supported in SQL Server. Fortunately there are several methods available to provide this functionality. 

We'll cover the standard table variable techniques to preserve data outside of transaction scope, and how the new in-memory table type can improve their performance.  Other techniques like user-defined events, CLR procedures, linked servers will also be demonstrated, and how they can enhance functionality.

We'll review minimal techniques like RAISERROR and the new SESSION_CONTEXT() feature in SQL Server 2016, to provide different levels of logging and transaction management.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Working Effectively With Legacy SQL##
 
**Abstract**:
A legacy code base can be a frightening thing.  Between strict deadlines, ever-evolving requirements, differing skill levels of contributors over time, and historical circumstances, keeping database code clean and concise is difficult at best.  This example- and demo-driven talk will help you build out a mental framework to prune those gnarled code bases.  Much of this talk will be familiar to software developers who know of the "clean code" philosophy, but no knowledge of the topic is necessary.  If you shudder whenever you look at your SQL code base, this talk may be for you.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Backups  Restores: You're Not In Kansas Anymore!##
 
**Abstract**:
There is no place like home, there is no place like home! When a database crashes and you have to recover it, this may be what you're saying to yourself over and over.  It can feel like a house just landed on you if you're not prepared.  Ok, not really, but recovering a database from an unexpected event is often just as terrifying! If you aren't prepared for it, it's really going to hurt.  So what do you do? You prepare. You plan. You practice.  We'll talk about how the backup  restore process works in SQL Server and how it can help you prevent a Wizard of Oz situation!

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Learn History from Temporal Tables##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2016 came out with a bucket full of cool new features. One of them is Temporal Tables. They are basically history tables  of the normal tables; that allow us to retrieve data from any point in time for every change such as updates and deletes . It does this all without any change to application code and without using any behind the scene triggers. In this session, we will see what the requirements of creating temporal tables are. We will see the demo on insert and update functionality and how to query historical information using new TSQL clause. It will also cover some security concerns around theTemporal Tables.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Visualize Your Transaction Log##
 
**Abstract**:
The SQL transaction log can be a mystery to many DBAs.  We live in the age of visualizations, so let#39;s visualize the log!  In this session, we will examine the purpose and organization of the transaction log and will explore the log through a unique visualization tool.  We will consider common performance issues that are related to the logging mechanism and how to overcome these problems.  Finally, we will discuss some techniques to monitor the log so that potential performance problems can be addressed pro-actively.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Azure Automation using PowerShell##
 
**Abstract**:
The cloud is the new great tool in our toolbox. It offers the ability to quickly create and remove IT resources on-demand, at high value. This is a great opportunity for developers and organizations to spin up new solutions and test them without large capital investments. The real value in the cloud comes in to play when you are able to spin up and spin down resources, and their sizes as demanded by the application. Attendees of this session will learn how easy it is to automate creation and alteration of Azure resources from the PowerShell command line, and why that's important. We'll talk through different architecture types for cloud services where this is important.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Panel: Will the DBA Job of the Future Still Involve DBAs?##

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Managing Availability Groups with PowerShell##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Always On Availability Groups are all the craze. When you have a need to failover or modify a configuration there are some things that you can only do with PowerShell. Aside from these items, PowerShell can completely manage an AG. Join me for a demo filled session where we will create an Always On Availability Group from scratch to management with PowerShell, including the Windows Server Failover Cluster. From changing parameters to failover, we will have a blast using PowerShell with ease of use to make your life better. Let’s work smarter and not harder when managing this great feature of SQL Server.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: SQL Server Databaseology: A Deep Dive Into Database Internals##
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever taken apart a toaster or an alarm clock just to see how it worked? Ever wondered how that database actually functions at the record level, behind the scenes? SQL Server Databaseology is the study of SQL Server databases and their structures down to the very core of the records themselves. In this session, we will explore some of the deep inner workings of a SQL Server database at the record and page level.  You will walk away with a better understanding of how SQL Server stores data and that knowledge will allow you to build better, faster databases.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Women in Technology: Identifying and Understanding Gender Bias  Inequality##
 
**Abstract**:
Gender Bias is something we're all guilty of.  It's typically unconscious and often stems from long held misperceptions about women  job responsibilities.  We'll learn how to identify gender bias when we see it.  We'll discuss why it's important, how it affects our work, decision making, hiring, etc.  We'll discuss strategies for how  both men and women can combat this at work  in our every day lives.  This session is about developing positive solutions to a problem that often goes undiscussed.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: The 20% of DAX That Gets You 80% of the Way There##
 
**Abstract**:
For those of us coming from a SQL background It's easy to get intimidated by DAX.  It's a weird language meant to appeal to Excel people while also mimicking much of the functionality of MDX.  This session will cover the topics that will make you productive immediately with DAX.  Those topics are 1) Calculated Columns v. Measures, 2) Implicit vs. Explicit Measures, 3) the CALCULATE function, 4) Time Intelligence,  5) CUBEVALUE.  This is truly the 20% of DAX that will make you productive in 80% of situations.  We're going to start with a working data model and start building calculations right away - bring your laptop.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

Business Intelligence is one of the hottest job skills in the IT field. DBAs and Database Developers are being asked to implement databases with non-traditional design, and are having a lot of new vocabulary thrown their way. In this talk you will learn the concepts behind building and designing data warehouses, and cut through the buzz words so you will walk away with a clear understanding of what words like dimensions, facts, and measures mean.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Query Store Primer##
 
**Abstract**:
This session will take a look at the new Query Store feature in SQL Server 2016.  Query Store tracks changes in execution plans, allowing you to easily view performance differences and revert to older plans with a few clicks of the mouse. We will take a hands on look at how to use Query Store to troubleshoot problems as well as some of the new DMVs you can use to find issues as they arise.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Performance Monitoring with Quest##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you ever get the question "is there something going on with the database?" Does your manager ever ask you "what happened last night?" Does the performance of your database instances keep you awake at night? Do you need to quickly identify and address problems? Are you managing more than just SQL Server? These are just a few of the topics of conversation I've had with organizations over the years. Maybe we can help you answer these questions and more. We'll discuss how Quest's performance monitoring solutions can be used to proactively notify you of problems, to quickly diagnose them, and to dig deeply to uncover their source.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Word Up: Text Mining in SQL##
 
**Abstract**:
Would a database by any other name smell as sweet? 

Our databases are filled with words. By mining our text for patterns and meanings, we can extract the emotional content, track changes over time, ferret out plagiarism, find common phrases and usage, and even predict future text. 

Learn how to dig through your library of language to make your data better.

I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.

##Title: Disaster Recovery Where to Begin##
 
**Abstract**:
So you have a good backup strategy in place, but now you have to think about a disaster recovery.  Where do you start and what are your options?  SQL Server offers several options, but then how do you choose the right one to meet your business requirements?  In this session, we will go over some of the common DR options including log shipping, replication, mirroring, clustering, and AlwaysOn.  Then we will talk about how to choose the best one to meet your business needs.

**Ben Boise** 
I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.
