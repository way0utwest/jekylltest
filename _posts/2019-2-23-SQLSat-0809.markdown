## Title: Test Driven Development in SQL Server – how to deploy code safer
 
**Abstract**:
Test Driven Development (TDD)  is a design approach which has enabled application developers to write cleaner code. 
It is relevant for database development as it ensures that code produced using TDD and unit tests will be of higher quality which means interactions with data will be safer. 
TDD is not a new method of unit testing, it is an essential design practice for improving the quality of your deployed code.
In this session it will be shown how we can use TDD to design and write better unit tests using open-source frameworks and industry standard tools. These tools can be run within SQL Server Management Studio which means DBAs can also take advantage of TDD and unit test, to ensure more reliable code is deployed to databases. 
TDD can result in code that can be deployed more reliably and faster when using DevOps processes such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. 
A comprehensive DEMO will reveal how Test Driven Development can help you deploy database code safer.

## Title: Embrace and Extend: First-Class Activity and 3rd Party Ecosystem for SSIS in ADF
 
**Abstract**:
This session focuses on the deeper integration of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) in Azure Data Factory (ADF) and the broad extensibility of Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime (IR). We will first show you how to provision Azure-SSIS IR - dedicated ADF servers for lifting  shifting SSIS packages - and extend it with custom/3rd party components. You can then use the familiar SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)/SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to design/deploy/execute/monitor your SSIS packages in the cloud just like you do on premises. Next, we will guide you to trigger/schedule SSIS package executions as first-class activities in ADF pipelines and combine/chain them with other activities, allowing you to inject/splice built-in data transformations in your ETL/ELT workflows, provision Azure-SSIS IR on demand/just in time, etc. And finally, you will learn about the licensing model for ISVs to develop paid components/extensions and join the growing 3rd party ecosystem for SSIS in ADF.

## Title: DAX as a Query Language
 
**Abstract**:
Many people (business and IT) already use Power Pivot, Power BI and SSAS Tabular to produce reporting and analytics tools.  But did you know that these tools also have their own query language?   In traditional databases such as SQL server, it is possible to extract data into a new table.  The same is possible using DAX as a query language with a tabular data model.

In this session, Matt will introduce the topic and show how you can use DAX Studio to connect to a data model.  Once connected, DAX studio can be used to write queries over the tabular data model to start to interrogate the data itself (as opposed to simply aggregating the values into a pivot table or a Power BI report).  The learning can then be used to write more complex DAX measures or alternatively it can be used to extract tabular data directly into a table for further analysis.

## Title: Creative DAX
 
**Abstract**:
Did you know the DAX language is far more capable than merely running a SUM over a column, or counting rows in a table? DAX sits on top of one of the fastest databases around, and this session will explore some unusual and creative scenarios that you previously would have thought as not possible using just DAX.

The session will aim to reset your understanding of what is possible in DAX by walking through some interesting code highlights from a recent series of games built using DAX (Blackjack, Sudoku , Tic Tac Toe , Hangman  Minesweeper). Each game pushes and explores different boundaries in DAX and will attempt to show just where those lines are.

The session will hopefully inspire you to add some creative and exciting techniques to your own DAX based data models.

## Title: GITHB 101 - An introduction to using Github and Git for Source Control and Open Source Projects
 
**Abstract**:
In the last few years the requirement to understand and use distributed Source control systems has become an increasing part of a Data Professionals life. 
With the move into Open Source and community involvement even Microsoft has embraced the use of GitHub!

In this session we will investigate the setup and use of GitHub and Git for source control.
Using the highly popular DBATools open source project we will also investigate getting involved in an Open Source project and the process of Pull and Push requests!

Based around personal experience of learning not to hate Source control, this session assume no experience with Git or Github

## Title: Unleash Row Level Security Patterns in Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
Security is different from Sharing, Sharing is about sharing the entire content with others, security is about authorizing different views of the content to others. In this session we go through many different Row Level Security patterns; Static Row Level Security, Dynamic Row Level Security, and many variations of the dynamic RLS, such as giving manager access as well as employee access, you will learn about user profile security scenarios, and hierarchical access levels. This session shows you how DAX and Power BI security comes together to play an important part of a Power BI project lifecycle: Row Level Security. Session is full of demos and you will learn these concepts through many live demos.

## Title: Beyond Devops - Introducing Data Reliability Engineering
 
**Abstract**:
Today’s database professionals must be engineers, not just administrators. We build things. We create things. As engineers practicing devops, we are all in this together, and nothing is someone else’s problem. As engineers, we apply repeatable processes, established knowledge, and expert judgment to design, build, and operate production data stores and the data structures within. As database reliability engineers, we must take the operational principles and the depth of database expertise that we possess one step further.

Guiding Principles of the DBRE
* Protect the Data
* Self-Service for Scale
* Elimination of Toil
* Databases Are Not Special Snowflakes
* Eliminate the Barriers Between Software and Operations

## Title: A look at Microsoft Data Flows with Charles Sterling
 
**Abstract**:
Preparing and defining ETL for insights is significant challenge for businesses today—ingestion, cleansing, transformation, and enrichment are labor-intensive and time-consuming tasks, which require deep technical skills. Power BI now introduces advanced data prep with dataflows—a suite self-service low-code/no-code features and capabilities for business analysts to easily process and unify their data and store it in Azure-based data-lake storage. With these new capabilities, Power BI offers a solution for any business need—whether you want to prep your data with ease, using a familiar built-in Power Query experience, or to leverage the full Azure stack for more advanced use-cases. Join this session to learn how to easily prep your data, leverage Microsoft’s standardized schema, improve time-to-value, eliminate data silos, and create one source of truth for your organizational insights.   This session will also finish with a look at some of the AI features that will be coming soon!

## Title: BI in Modern Excel: The value is in the Refresh
 
**Abstract**:
2 text transaction files, a pivoted excel budget file, 20 Power Queries, 6 dimensional tables, and one interactive Excel dashboard = mind blowing awesomeness in under 60 minutes.  But while the analysis is important, the real value in the refresh.  Can your model pull in another 22 text files and next year's budgets in less than a minute?  This model can.
Come and see how Excel 2016 gives us the ability to not only rapidly create business intelligence, but also allows us to build engaging and interactive models that can be quickly updated and shared via Power BI.

## Title: Bridging the gap between SSRS and Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
Traditionally, SSRS is used for paginated reports which gives flexibility like drill through reports, subscriptions and print formatting. With Power BI the reports are now more interactive and dynamic. There are still few gaps between these two platforms which are built to purpose. This gap is getting smaller as features are ported between these two platforms. In this session I will be going through various features which are bridging these gaps and point out the differences. These are significant and can affect your decision in choosing the right platform which will fit your needs.
