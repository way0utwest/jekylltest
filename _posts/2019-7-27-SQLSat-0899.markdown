## Title: Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent
 
**Abstract**:
The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT, and Prod is a challenge whether on-premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.

## Title: Become a T-SQL Pivoting Ninja in 60 Minutes Or Less
 
**Abstract**:
Stop wasting time using Excel Pivot Tables. Create them in SQL with ease.

Become a query writing ninja who uses the Pivot operator to move unique column values into multiple column names for better data insight. In this demo-heavy presentation, you will learn how to create pivot tables enhanced with multiple aggregate columns and column totals using Rollup and Cube operators, and the grouping function. Attendees will also learn to use the Unpivot Operator.

Come join me, and by the end of this session, you will have the knowledge to level up your pivoting skills to that of a ninja or maybe even *Chuck Norris.

## Title: PowerShell + SQL Server = Better Together
 
**Abstract**:
As a SQL Server professional, are you able to make a rhyme or reason to this thing called PowerShell? Need to accomplish something? Do you use Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core? How will you interface with PowerShell? With the PowerShell console, ISE, VSCode, SAPIEN PowerShell Studio, or something else? Will you use Cmdlets from one of the various SQL related PowerShell modules? If so, which one? SQLPS, SQLServer, DBATools, etc. Or maybe you should use the SQL PS provider? What about SMO? Or write your own custom .NET code that can be executed with PowerShell? With it being so difficult to determine how to go about running something in PowerShell, it’s no wonder that most people resort to searching the Internet to figure it out. The sad thing is that most of the PowerShell code you’ll find on the Internet is less than optimal to say the least. I'll demonstrate how and when to use different approaches along with adhering to the community’s best practices for writing PowerShell code.

## Title: Exploring the latest T-SQL enhancements
 
**Abstract**:
With the most recent release of SQL Server 2017 and the upcoming release of SQL Server 2019, there are several enhancements that were introduced for the T-SQL language. This includes new string functions, bulk access options and approximate query processing among others that address several challenges that SQL developers have to confront.  

In this demo heavy session, we will go over several of the new features, provide a demonstration of how you can use them, and share any considerations that you may need to consider before doing so. This session is intended for anyone interested in what’s new in the T-SQL language and will focus primarily just on enhancements to traditional T-SQL for the database engine.

## Title: That's So Metadata: Discover Your Database From The Inside
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever needed to learn a new database design and don't know where to begin? Or are trying to find out why a query doesn't perform well?  Or need to provide security information to auditors or your security team?

SQL Server has numerous metadata facilities available to help you with these tasks and more. Functions, dynamic management views, and system stored procedures can illuminate details from a single column up through an entire SQL Server instance. We will demonstrate metadata techniques to help you:

- Document your database schema objects such as procedures, functions, tables, columns and indexes
- Investigate performance and look for bottlenecks and tuning opportunities
- Discover metadata to administer your databases backups, index maintenance, and security
- Apply your own metadata using extended properties

We will also cover the official Microsoft documentation on these features and other resources on how to use them.

## Title: PowerShell Core for Linux
 
**Abstract**:
With the advent of SQL Server for Linux, you need a tool you can use to manage it. Sure, you could try to learn bash, python, or some other tool, but wouldn't it be nice to be able to use a scripting language you're familiar with? Or maybe you are a long time Linux admin, now having to work with all this new Microsoft technology. Wouldn't it be great to leverage tools that make your life even easier?

In this session you'll learn all about PowerShell Core for Linux. You'll see just how quick and easy it is to install PowerShell Core, then interact with it from the terminal. But wait, there's more! You'll want a good editor to compose your PowerShell Core scripts in, and that's where VSCode comes in. You'll see how easy it is to install VSCode, then work with your PowerShell Core project within it. 

We'll wrap up the session showing how to install SQL Server in a Docker Container, all using PowerShell Core!

## Title: How to Build Your Disaster Recovery Plan
 
**Abstract**:
So your boss asked for a copy of your DR plan.  Once you've wiped that deer-in-the-headlights look off your face, you realize "We've got database backups," isn't exactly a plan.  You need to come up with a plan to recover your business when disaster strikes. This session will help you build this plan by defining what a disaster could be, documenting the business impact, and identifying your limitations.  We will show how to use this information to establish metrics (such as RTO and RPO), document current recovery configurations, and design an effective recovery strategy that meets the needs and budget of your business. Attending this session will give you the knowledge and tools to create an effective disaster recovery plan that will make your boss happy and ensure the continuity of your business.

## Title: User Experience Brilliance in Power BI Dashboards
 
**Abstract**:
User Experience (UX) and Design Thinking are common buzz words around the office. What do these words have to do with BI and Dashboards, anyway? 
Sure, Power BI itself is intuitive and user friendly, but are YOU building dashboards that give the best user experience? 
In this session we will explore in a hands-on exercise what UX and Design thinking is, how to apply the methodologies to our daily work and then how we could apply it to BI to make kick ass dashboards and reporting for our internal and external customers.

We'll go through the process of item creation from an item writer's viewpoint, what rules item writers must follow, and why questions sometimes have strange phrasing. For any technical skillset pursuing certification, we'll review non-technical sample questions and walk through the process of using information at your disposal. You'll better understand how to deconstruct the problem statement. We'll leave time for QA with a veteran of the Microsoft certification exam writing process.

On Jan 12, 2019, Peter attended his first SQL Saturday and experienced an engaging and uplifting community that encouraged everyone regularly to give back. That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.
