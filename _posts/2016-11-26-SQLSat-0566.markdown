##Title: Troubleshooting delle prestazioni delle query con SQL Server 2016 Query Store##
 
**Abstract**:
Query Data Store è la nuova funzionalità di SQLServer 2016 che permette la storicizzazione nel tempo delle prestazioni delle query in termini di consumo delle risorse e dei relativi piani di esecuzione, oltre i riavvii della macchina.
La sessione entra nel dettaglio di Query Store e mostra come questo meccanismo permetta di effettuare analisi sofisticate del comportamento delle query e delle loro prestazioni. Illustra come sia possibile correlare il cambiamento delle performances ed il consumo delle risorse a quello del piano di esecuzione oppure seguire nel tempo l’evoluzione di un piano di esecuzione in funzione di eventi quali cambio delle statistiche, modifiche dello schema o presenza di indici. Inoltre, analizzare le prestazioni di determinate porzioni del codice, individuare regressioni e identificare le query che hanno degradato nelle ultime esecuzioni tra tutte quelle eseguite. 
Più in generale, la sessione mostra come trarre il massimo vantaggio da questa funzionalità in un’

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

##Title: Giving Permissions through Stored Procedures##
 
**Abstract**:
You probably know that with a stored procedure you can permit users to access or update data even if they have no direct permissions on the table. But you may have noticed that this does not work when the SP uses dynamic SQL. 

In this session you will learn why it is so and techniques how you can use to overcome this. You will also learn that the same techniques can be to permit users to perform specific actions they need to do without granting them general high-level permissions on database or server level by packaging these actions into a stored procedure. You will also learn why should should be careful with setting a database TRUSTWORTHY.

The session should be of interest both to DBAs and application developers that need to consider advanced permissions in their stored procedures.

##Title: SQL Server Extended Events: monitoring  tuning (IT)##
 
**Abstract**:
Extended Events è un sistema per la raccolta di eventi generati dai vari componenti di SQL Server a scopo diagnostico. Introdotto in SQL Server 2008 è stato inizialmente considerato da molti unicamente come futuro sostituto di SQL Trace con il pregio di avere un minore impatto sul sistema tracciato. In realtà Extended Events ha sempre offerto funzionalità uniche per la raccolta e la correlazione di alcuni eventi tramite un singolo strumento. In questa sessione vedremo come utilizzare al meglio questo sistema che con il tempo è diventato un componente sempre più importante dell'infrastruttura diagnostica anche per l'ottimizzazione delle prestazioni.

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

**Abstract**:
Dopo alcuni mesi di utilizzo delle tabelle temporali potremmo trovarci con milioni di record nelle tabelle "storiche" che (forse) non ci serviranno poi così spesso oppure non ci serviranno mai. Dopo una adeguata introduzione rivolta a chi non avesse ancora approcciato questa nuova feature di SQL Server 2016 di procederà all'analisi delle tecniche per fare della adeguata manutenzione in scenari critici.

I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

##Title: SQL Server Infernals: Worst Practices in Action##
 
**Abstract**:
Let’s face it: Best Practices are too many to really know them all and choose which ones should be applied first. Does your telephone ring all the time? Do your users ask for that “quick report” that instead takes ages and keeps changing every time you think it’s done? 

Have you ever thought that in dire times avoiding Worst Practices could be a good starting point and you can leave fine tuning for a better future? If the answer is “yes”, then this session is for you: we will discover together how not to torture a SQL Server instance and we will see how to avoid making choices that in the long run could turn out to be not as smart as they looked initially.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

##Title: SQL Server tuning in pillole##
 
**Abstract**:
E' capitato anche a voi di avere a che fare con l'ottimizzazione delle prestazioni di SQL Server ? Magari quella query che certi giorni va come una fucilata e altri lentissima ? In questa sessione, di taglio pratico, vedremo quali sono le metodologie di analisi e tuning delle query, attraverso piccoli esempi mirati (pillole, appunto), che forniscano, se non proprio una soluzione, almeno uno spunto di riflessione per migliorare l'uso di SQL Server ed ottimizzarne le performance.

##Title: APPLY operator in action##
 
**Abstract**:
APPLY operator is a T-SQL table operator that allows to boost query perfomance and to solve complex calculation problems in an very efficient way. 
But it isn't easy to understandt how does it work and how it can be applied to our queries. 
In this session, we will examine the various types of APPLY operator (CROSS APPLY, OUTER APPLY) to understand it's behaviour and the power it holds.
We will go through many real world cases to show how we can use the APPLY operator when writing queries instead of JOINs 
and we will show how performances can be improved by using this operator the right way.

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…
