## Title: XML Features in SQL 2005
 
**Abstract**:
XML in SQL 2000 wasn't very exciting and it was easy to dismiss it altogether by just relying on developers to handle any XML needed within the application. SQL 2005 changes the game and this session will show you how to use the new XML data type, do basic XML operations on XML data, and showcase the changes to FOR XML that make it so much more useful. This isn't a session to convince you to use XML, but to show you what you can do with XML if you do need to use it!

## Title: Benchmarking: The Forgotten Role of Performance
 
**Abstract**:
As DBA’s in the SQL Server world become increasingly concerned with performance management of the SQL Servers, the interesting item that appears to be forgotten by most is the underlying performance characteristics of the hardware, the database and lastly the SQL Code that is been run against the server. If the hard disk system can only write at 200mb per second than the I/O issue that the DBA is confronting maybe hardware related and not the queries that are been run against the database.

Database Administrator by day and Author by night Brandie Tarvin sails pirate-populated waters, fights evil robots in disguise and turns kingdoms into chaotic rebellious city-states all while coding ETL processes and protecting real-world data from corruption. If it weren't for her, someone else would have the job and where would be the fun in that?

Brandie's first computer experience was with a State-of-the-Art Commodore 64 brought home by her father, who informed her that "computers are NOT toys" and would not let her use it until she learned how to program. In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville.
