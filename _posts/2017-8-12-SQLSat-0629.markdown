## Title: SELECT Provider FROM Cloud
 
**Abstract**:
Are you starting to think that this cloud thing may actually take off?  Perhaps it has become your responsibility to look for a cloud provider to meet the data needs of your employer/client or you want to be ready in case someone asks.  In this session, we will spend a few moments defining Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) before moving on to a brief discussion regarding cloud objections and misconceptions.  Finally, we reach our destination, a conversation based in the classic high school essay test question “Compare and Contrast” concerning data centric services in AWS and Azure.  The focus of this session is available features not necessarily how to use them.

## Title: Using SQL as the Key to Robust Automation
 
**Abstract**:
Kelverion Best Practices; Using a Persistent Data Store

It is Kelverion’s recommendation that in nearly every case runbook automations be implemented utilizing a small backend SQL database table or set of tables. This document explains why we make this recommendation.

Persistence

The ORCHESTRATOR data bus is extremely powerful but it is not persistent. This means that if the ORCHESTRATOR runbook server were to reboot or the services were to crash all data about executing runbooks would be lost. So a complicated multistep workflow that is counting on the data bus for its current state would need to be restarted manually by an administrator. That administrator would potentially need to take significant time to understand what parts of the workflow had run successfully and what parts were still needed. If a persistent data store is used at the backend, the last successful step in the process has been recorded in the database with all necessary information to continue the next step.

## Title: Where Does R Fit Into Your SQL Server Stack?
 
**Abstract**:
Now that SQL Server 2016 includes support for R in the database, how does this change your BI implementation options?

In this session, we start with a brief introduction to R and explain why it’s increasingly popular, the typical development workflow, which tools you can use, common use cases, and where it fits into the latest Microsoft stack at a high level.

Then we’ll review how to implement R Services so that you can use R with SQL Server data, including how to install R packages on SQL Server, how to use rx functions, and how to operationalize R in SQL Server.

Then we explore options for using R to prepare data for analytics using SSIS or Power BI and how to report and visualize data using SSRS or Power BI.

## Title: Handling Temporal Data in SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
In many industries, it is necessary for data professionals to be able to show what a data set looked like at a previous point in time. Whether it's calculating tax or insurance rates based on a contract date, quickly comparing data changes over time for trend analysis or just recovering from an accidental data change, it's useful to be able to look back in time through our data. Solutions like Change Data Capture or trigger-based audit tables can be slow, or require a lot of extra code to be effective. Fortunately, SQL Server 2016 introduces system-versioned tables, also known as Temporal Tables, which track data through time with far less overhead than other solutions. In this session, you'll learn how to create temporal tables, how SQL Server manages data within those tables, and how to query data at a specific point in time using several real-world examples.

## Title: Tame Your Unruly Data With Constraints
 
**Abstract**:
Bad data comes in many forms: duplicate rows, wrong data type, invalid values, and orphaned or missing foreign keys. Time is wasted cleansing, reviewing and correcting data, not to mention the potential hazards bad data can cause. This introductory presentation will explain the data types and constraints available in SQL Server, and how they can replace or augment business rules that would otherwise be written in application or procedure code. Performance benefits provided by constraints will be demonstrated. We will examine the various system views and procedures that describe constraints and how to use them to document your databases. You will be able to apply this knowledge to your database environments and see significant improvements in data quality, performance, and reliability.

## Title: Securing SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
A default SQL Server installation is reasonably secure, but quot;reasonably securequot; doesn#39;t cut it in an era in which one bad line of code, one weak password, or one open port can result in your customer database ending up on Pastebin. In this talk, we will look at different methods of securing a SQL Server instance, from venerable (principle of least privilege, Transparent Data Encryption) to novel (Always Encrypted, row-level security). These tools and techniques will show us ways for developers, database administrators, and network specialists to work together to secure SQL Server instances.

## Title: SQL Server Encryption
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever wanted to know how Transparent Database Encryption (TDE) works or how you set it up? What about encrypting your backups? This session will go over all the steps and caveats that go with this technology. TDE allows you to have your database encrypted on disk and the same Encryption Hierarchy allows you to back up your database and have it encrypt the contents in the backup file.  We will discuss the Encryption Hierarchy which is used for encryption in SQL Server and take you through keeping your secrets safe. We will also go over how Always Encrypted works as well. Master the concepts of SQL Server Encryption when you are done with this session.

## Title: Read Dirty to Me - Isolation Levels/User Impact
 
**Abstract**:
Issue a "SELECT {data} FROM {myTable}" statement and users need to trust the data returned is accurate. What happens when multiple processes access the same data? What happens further if one of those process is an UPDATE or even a DELETE statement? How about if both processes will be updating that data? Understanding Isolation in SQL Server is paramount in ensuring data integrity in your system. We will cover the different levels of isolation and how they impact what a user views when accessing the data at a given point-in-time.

## Title: From SQL to DAX – another way of extract data
 
**Abstract**:
Summary: This presentation is to provide BI consultants and SQL developers with different DAX and tabular modeling solutions which can be replacements of SQL querying and high resource consuming ETL processes.
Abstract:
Many of us are coming from knowing SQL before they have been introduced with DAX or many of us know how to use tabular model through reporting tool but do not know they can use DAX as query language against a tabular model. 
Thus, I am glad to provide this presentation focusing on three areas:
1. How to use DAX as a query language to select columns (columns from multiple tables and from value); Group Data; Filter Data; Join Tables; Build customized calculations/measures 
2. How to use tracing tools to monitor the performance difference between SQL solution and DAX solution;
3. Use  a real life example to demonstrate how to DAX and tabular modeling  (Row Contexts vs. Filter Contexts+Bridge Table+Inactive relationship+extended table) to replace high resource ETL Processes

## Title: SQL into R: an Absolute Beginners' Guide to R for the SQL User
 
**Abstract**:
SQL data can be exported to any number of data manipulation, visualization, and reporting packages, including R. But what, exactly, is R and why would anyone consider it when there are already so many other choices available? We will answer those questions by considering: (1) what is R? (2) how does it work? (3) why is it so popular (4) what is so special about it?
We will do this using side-by-side examples of R and SQL code, and by using the "pipe" operator in R to connect several operations to analyze a publicly-available data set. By the end of this session, the attendees will have the previous questions answered and be able to decide whether to consider R, or to stay with their current solution.

## Title: How to Keep Your Databases Secure in Just Minutes a Day
 
**Abstract**:
You’re busy. You don’t have time to check the security of your systems all the time, right? It’s not like anyone has added a user that you don’t know about. And no one would create a database and add all logins to the db_owner role. And of course, no one would ever think of setting the TRUSTWORTHY property on a database... right?

Things like that happen on a daily basis, poking holes in even the most well-secured database. Those holes are just waiting for someone to find them. That someone could be you, or it could be an attacker probing for a way to get data from your company.

In this session, we will explore how to create reports that are quick to review so you can find the holes before someone else does - without interfering with the rest of your day. Along the way, you'll also learn where to find security-related information in SQL Server's metadata and logs to allow you to customize and extend the reports to meet your company's unique needs.

## Title: The Data-Professional’s Junk Drawer
 
**Abstract**:
There is at least one in your home right now, a box, a basket, a bucket, perhaps even actually drawer; hastily organized at best but full of tools, gadgets, widgets and whatchamacallits designed for one or two specific purposes.  Realistically, we all want to use the more generic, multipurposed item found in our “well organized place for storing things”, yet deep down we know that tool/gadget/widget etc. is really what we need.  As data-professionals, we are all familiar with the largest “junk drawer” ever created, the Internet.  In this session, we will discuss some tools which are not data specific, the jobs they do well, and where to find them.  Join as us as explore Robocopy, parts of the SysInterals Suite, a connection manager or two, portables apps aplenty and more so that you can move that file more efficiently, troubleshoot that problem through a different lens, or simply know what the heck someone else is talking about.

## Title: Right-Size Your Data Files
 
**Abstract**:
Best practices for SQL Server indicate that when configuring tempdb, we should create multiple files for better performance.  So why is it this is often ignored for user databases, where our data is actually stored?

In this session we'll look into why having multiple files for databases and filegroups is important, even on solid state drives.  Then we'll look into some scripts and tools that will assist us in transforming our databases to be right-sized for performance considerations.
