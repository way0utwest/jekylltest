## Title: Data Science Track in the Microsoft Professional (Degree) Program [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
Gain the skills you need to help you get the job you want - and use new, innovative solutions and knowledge services to build up your skills.

When you apply for a job in data science, employers want to know if you can analyze and visualize data with Excel or Power BI and whether you can use R or Python to explore the data. They also want to know that you understand key topics, like statistics and machine learning. 

Use the latest tools to solve real-world data problems
It takes more than knowledge to be effective as a data scientist—technical skills and real-world experience with data are critical. The courses in the Microsoft Professional Program include hands-on labs so you can practice with tools used by data scientists in the field today.

We show you in that session, how you can benefit from this Microsoft Professional Degree Program - Data Science, how we enrich the Microsoft content with additional services and what you can expect from this best-of-breed solution

## Title: Women in Technology – Ein Thema in Österreich? [DE]
 
**Abstract**:
Weltweit ist die Anzahl von Frauen in technischen Berufen und speziell in der IT niedriger als in anderen Berufsgruppen. Wie gestaltet sich die Situation in Österreich? Und welche Gründe könnten hierzulande Einfluss darauf haben?

In einer offenen Gesprächsrunde möchten wir euch Zahlen und Fakten zu dem Thema sowie eigene Erfahrungsberichte präsentieren. Viel mehr sind wir aber an euren Erfahrungen und Meinungen interessiert? Musstet ihr Hindernisse in euren Berufsweg überwinden? Wünscht ihr euch Frauen im Team? Seid ihr auf der Suche nach Angestellten und würdet euch über weibliche Mitarbeiter freuen? Jeder ist hier gefragt und willkommen.

Genauso wichtig ist für uns, wie ihr die Rolle der PASS in diesem Kontext seht. Können wir etwas tun? Sollten wir auch? Was würdet ihr euch von uns wünschen?

Wir freuen uns auf eine rege Beteiligung. :-)

## Title: New Security Features in SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will explore the new features introduced with SQL Server 2016 to enhance security. 
Always Encrypted is a new technology that protects your data not only at rest, but also throughout the whole interaction between the application and the database.
Dynamic Data Masking is another interesting feature that allows us to protect sensitive data by masking it to all users that don’t have enough privileges to see the actual contents.
Row Level Security allows showing to end users only the data they’re entitled to access, without changing the applications’ code.
We will demonstrate the use of these three features with example applications and we will explore the use cases where these technologies represent a big leap from previous custom implementations.

## Title: Multi-client SSAS deployment : What's MDS got to do with? [DE]
 
**Abstract**:
A typical business case: A customer needs an analytical approach for several departments. Some requirements are identical, others differ. How do you design your architecture? Do you prefer building one big solution containing everything or do you build several small solutions, repeatedly building the shared requirements?

In this session we are looking into one possible approach: Build a large solution containing all client views. Maintain the client-specific master data in MDS 2016. The client specific deployment is designed to use AMO based on a client specific configuration.

But how about the Tabular mode? Let's find out together if we can apply a similar approach by using TOM, the AMO extension for tabular model in SQL Server 2016.

## Title: R 101 - What is this R thing, and is it worth some effort? [DE]
 
**Abstract**:
Everyone has heard phrases like "Data is the new oil" or  "Data Analytics will shape business", and maybe you are also wondering what this R thing is about and if it's worth the effort to learn something new. This session is going to explain what R is and how it can help to refine your data and to better understand your business. Meaning, it provides ideas where R can be used in helping to answer some data related questions. An overview is given how R works with Power BI, from data cleansing to  data enhancing to  data visualization. An explanation is given why R will be a great addition to the SQL Server arsenal and how R can be used with Azure Machine Learning. This session is not about coding or statistics, but about introducing a great new companion.

## Title: SQL Server Infernals: Worst Practices in Action [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
Let’s face it: Best Practices are too many to really know them all and choose which ones should be applied first. Does your telephone ring all the time? Do your users ask for that “quick report” that instead takes ages and keeps changing every time you think it’s done? 

Have you ever thought that in dire times avoiding Worst Practices could be a good starting point and you can leave fine tuning for a better future? If the answer is “yes”, then this session is for you: we will discover together how not to torture a SQL Server instance and we will see how to avoid making choices that in the long run could turn out to be not as smart as they looked initially.

## Title: IoT in the wild [DE]
 
**Abstract**:
In this session the learnings and architecture of an implemented IoT prototype will be presented. It implements a full working IoT solution with as less as possible individual coding and as such ready “made” components were preferred. Therefore, components like Azure IoTHub, Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Data Factory, Azure Logic Apps, Azure SQL Database, Power BI, and many more were put together. The implemented approach includes alarming, aggregation (Stream Analytics) and concludes with Machine Learning processes.

You will see an active solution with all parts working in a ready-made demo up to the dashboards in Power BI. So get ready for an interesting practical view on IoT in the "wild".

## Title: Azure 101 for DB Administrators [DE]
 
**Abstract**:
Die Cloud ist derzeit das Thema in der IT. Microsoft hat mit seiner Cloud Plattform Azure eine umfassende Lösung für die Entwicklung und den Betrieb von Anwendungen bereitgestellt, die in vielen Szenarien (Serverless-Computing, Mobile-Anwendungen, etc.) eingesetzt werden kann. Da es auch für Datenbank Administratoren und Entwickler interessant ist, welche Anwendungen auf meine Datenbank zugreifen, möchte ich in dieser Session einen kurzen Einblick in die verschiedenen Services von Azure liefern. Mit prägnanten Beispielen wird gezeigt, wie diese eingesetzt werden können und in Verbindung mit einem SQL Server stehen. Ebenso möchte ich zeigen, wie die Verwaltung und Einrichtung eines Azure-Kontos funktioniert und welche Tipps und Tricks es gibt, um Kosten zu sparen.

**Abstract**:
Azure Data Lake Analytics (ADLA) is a new service from Microsoft for Analytics on Big Data Workload. U-SQL as a query language offers extraordinary query and transformation power by combining C# and SQL together. Nice! But: How do you integrate this service into your existing BI workload? 

In this session you will learn how to integrate relational databases (SQL Azure DB, Azure DWH, or SQL Server) by federation with ADLA, how to trigger jobs from on-prem systems like SSIS, and how to orchestrate the service via Azure Data Factory. Through live demos you will see that this service gives you great computing power for your BI landscape and integration is not that difficult.

## Title: Exploring Dark Data with SQL Server 2016 and R [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
With the addition of R into SQL Server 2016, Microsoft have provided a few extra degrees of freedom for the standard SQL developer. You can now use the R language to wrangle, clean and collect external data, using libraries and functionality that simply wasn’t available to you before with regular T-SQL. Performing data enrichment at scale with SQL Server or even Microsoft R Server can provide extremely valuable new insights for your clients and start reaping the benefits of big data.
     
In this session, Consolidata’s Oliver Frost shows you how to develop your own application for tapping into ‘dark data’. Ollie will demonstrate how to stream live tweets, perform aggregations in R and pipe the output to a Power BI dashboard, giving you a full end-to-end experience of the importance of learning some basic R code in 2016. 
     
This session is for anyone who is new to R and is interesting expanding their skill set beyond their comfort zone in SQL Server.
