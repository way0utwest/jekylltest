## Title: Setting up your BI Infrastructure
 
**Abstract**:
We know BI in bits and pieces. But imagine if you had to setup the BI infrastructure from scratch. 

We will discuss 
1. Selection of technology(Hardware/Software/Technology)
2. Selection of team(IT/Business/Adm
3. Maintenance (HA/DR)
4. Security
5. Best practices 
6. Copy Data sprawl and how to overcome it.
7. Getting a management buy-in.

We can discuss whether to outsource this project or rise above our DBA job and do it ourselves. 

Last but not the least: one of the things that plagues most leaders/Project Managers is the Scope Creep. When you are setting up a complex infrastructure like your own BI infrastructure, Scope Creep is easy and we will also discuss how easy it is to mess up the project because we could not control the Scope Creep.

## Title: Practical use of CTEs, Ranking Functions, MERGE statement, OUTPUT clause and other latest features i
 
**Abstract**:
Not so long time ago SQL Server development was enriched with new T-SQL features, such as CTE (common table extension), array of Ranking functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, TILE), MERGE statement, OUTPUT clause, EXCEPT, INTERSECT to name a few. For different reasons some DBA/Developers do not utilize those. In this session I demonstrate different practical use cases where these features could make T-SQL coding more efficient. This 100% code-based demo session highlights  efficiency to utilize latest T-SQL function over conventional method with the same functionality. I'll cover in deeps live scenarios where those features won performance efficiency, code readability and other advantages to use them within the stored procedures, functions, triggers and views.

## Title: Solving the Data Integration Problem for Non-Developers with Power Query
 
**Abstract**:
Self-service business intelligence (BI) technologies have gained popularity in the past few years. They often highlight how easy data exploration and fancy data visualizations are, but leave out the most expensive and time-consuming part of the process: preparing and integrating the data. Why? Perhaps because most self-service technologies fall short when pulling together information that is drawn from multiple systems.

In this session, learn how  businesses and IT can use Power Query--a free data integration tool and part of Power BI--to transform, combine, and share data from heterogeneous data sources, reducing the time and cost to prepare the data that is used to produce analysis and reports. We also discuss how Power Query fits in the larger BI landscape and the considerations and concerns that IT stakeholders have when adopting this type of self-service technology.

## Title: Testing Data and Data-Centric Applications
 
**Abstract**:
Testing applications that depend on data can be hard. Everyone agrees that testing is vital, but knowing what to test and how to test it is challenging. Come to this session for a methodology for testing your data, and the applications that use it.
Testing is vital to fast, successful delivery of software and information today. While application testing is generally well understood, data centric testing is not. The success of many applications depends on them producing valid, correct data, yet this is often tested as an afterthought, or not tested at all. During this session, we will discuss how to test the data produced by applications or data movement processes. We’ll cover how to determine the accuracy and quality of your data, and how to incorporate the testing into your data lifecycle. The focus will be on what you need to test, and the techniques for validating that the data produced is accurate.

## Title: Create and Load a Staging Environment from Scratch in an Hour with Biml
 
**Abstract**:
Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) automates your BI patterns and eliminates the manual repetition that consumes most of your SSIS development time. During this hour-long presentation, Jay Harris from Varigence will use the free BIDSHelper add-in for BIDS and SSDT to introduce Biml and use to automatically generate large quantities of custom SSIS packages. The session will be largely demonstration driven, and reusable sample code will be distributed for you to use in your own projects. Using a live-typing approach, Jay will start from scratch and by the end of the session create a full-blown staging environment. The best part is that you can freely reuse the code in your own environment just by changing the connection strings - or make small changes to implement your own data load patterns.

## Title: Getting Started with SSIS Script Tasks and Components
 
**Abstract**:
SSIS has many great built-in tasks and components. Sometime, though, you need to go further than what they allow. Come to this session for an introduction to the scripting capabilities of SSIS. 
Many data movement activities can be handled with SSIS using the built-in tasks and components. Eventually, though, you will run into a scenario that will be better handled by extending SSIS functionality with custom code. In this session, we will cover the basics of using scripts in SSIS control flows and data flows. We’ll talk about the pros and cons of scripts, review the development environment for scripts, cover some interesting and useful .NET classes, and walk through multiple examples of scripts that add useful functionality to SSIS.

## Title: Mastering and Enhancing Company Data
 
**Abstract**:
Getting a good 360 degree view of organizations (customers or vendors) or doing customer centric analysis is often complicated as a result of bad data/ duplicate data / inconsistent data coming from multiple systems. In addition, there are external factors like mergers and acquisitions, inter-company relationships and other nuances that may not be captured in source systems. Getting a clear picture of customer and vendor data can not only provide a clear picture for analysis of information, but also aid in critical risk management functions. In this session, you will learn about some techniques and data services from DB that you can use to clean and enhance your data.

## Title: Biml Recipes: Automatically create T-SQL Scripts for Common Tasks
 
**Abstract**:
You've probably heard a lot about Biml for SSIS automation, but did you know it can also be used for building complex, yet reusable T-SQL statements for common database tasks – in most cases much faster and more easily than you could with dynamic T-SQL.

This will be a scenario driven session where we discuss many real world examples of manual tasks that can be automated with Biml snippets and the free BIDS Helper AddIn to BIDS/SSDT. You will receive all code for your own use.

Scenarios include:
1) Generation of T-SQL merge statements that removes all the drudgery of manually mapping columns - including complex SCD column handling.
2) Stale data detection that uses Biml to create queries that display ranges for all date/time columns in each table of a target database - perfect for retiring tables from WorkDB and other ad hoc environments.
3) Sample data creation that automatically produces test data based on DDL schema information from your data model.
4) And much more

## Title: Analysis Services: Show Me Where It Hurts
 
**Abstract**:
"Its.Slow!" are probably the two most dreaded words for any database professional (right behind "You're fired!") 

What's slow? Since when? Compared to what?

Join this "something-everyone-should-be-doing-but-isn't" session, in which we will discuss baselines and performance monitoring for your SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) environment. We'll cover what a baseline is, what information it needs to include, and how it can help you troubleshoot immediate problems and proactively avoid them in the future. Walk away from the session with a plan that you can implemented next week to help avoid being caught off guard by SSAS performance issues and to make troubleshooting a breeze.

## Title: Context  Calculation, Back to the Basics with DAX
 
**Abstract**:
The learning curve for DAX isn't a straight line - it starts off gradual and quickly gets steep.  With a syntax similar to Excel, DAX seems easy enough for an Excel power user but things quickly get confusing without a good foundation in the basics of DAX.  Those basics - context and calculation - are the topic for this session.

This session is for the intermediate DAX user who has produced some quality data models and DAX calculations but who is still having difficulties with functions around filtering, time intelligence, and complex calculations.  We'll go through a number of practical examples that show that DAX at a fundamental level is a combination of creating filter and row CONTEXTS and then using those contexts to produce CALCULATIONS.  Understanding this concept is a must to produce more complex code in DAX and it's also a very useful framework for someone just getting started.

## Title: SSIS Unit and Integration Testing with the Open Source BEST project
 
**Abstract**:
Testing is critical to managing a high-quality data lifecycle. Unfortunately, SSIS has no built-in support for test authoring and the tools for relational database testing are limited. As a result, most organizations forgo automated testing and focus entirely on manual user testing, which is both expensive and often occurs too late in the process to address all of the issues discovered.  

Biml Enabled SSIS Test (BEST) [https://github.com/bimlscript/best] is an open source framework that enables users to define unit and integration tests for SSIS packages using your choice of database tables, Excel files, or XML.

In this session, you will learn how to use BEST to author your SSIS tests and how to use free open source tools to report and visualize test results as part of your existing production processes.

Note that while BEST is implemented using Biml, you do not need to learn Biml to use it.
