## Title: Unlock the Power of Pivot Tables
 
**Abstract**:
Your tabular model is done, approved and ready to be used by the user. 
By means of using Excel the user gets very excited about the use of tabular Models. For a while the user uses Excel as a self-service business intelligence tool. Then all of a sudden the user starts asking if they can use the program to extract more and other information from the tabular model by the use of Excel. Now it is up to you to familiarize the user with all the possibilities of working with the tabular model by means of Excel.

Given the small amount of documented knowledge about the use of tabular models by means of Excel, I will show you how to get the best of your tabular models by using Excel as a self-service business intelligence and data science tool. 
Filters, named sets, and calculations in the pivot table: I will explain it all!

## Title: Road to database automation: Database source control
 
**Abstract**:
Road to database automation addresses the challenges of database inclusion in the Application Lifecycle Management (ALM). The set of processes that enables this inclusion is designated as Database Lifecycle Management. DLM is composed by 3 main parts: data management and migration, data monitoring and data recovery. 
In this presentation I will discuss the DLM general concepts, with special emphasis on data management and migration, and present some strategies and tools (source control tools as Mercurial and Git and database migrations management tools as Flyway) that can be used to overcome the database source control phase.
Using automation as key factor to achieve database source control, database continuous integration and database continuous delivery. This session will not only unlock continuous integration and delivery phases but also enable agile practices that allows to mitigate/manage the gap between application and database development.

## Title: An Introduction to Execution Plans and The Query Optimizer
 
**Abstract**:
One of the most complex areas of SQL Server is the Query Optimizer.
It is the component responsible for turning the logical actions (that are derived from your SQL statements) into physical actions that fetch and process the required data to form your results. Not only does it have to guarantee the correct results (no mean feat when you start to think about it) but it has to do this in a performant way and the route it takes to do this (the output of the optimization process ) is described within the execution plan.

This session will be an introduction to the Optimizer and Execution Plans and take you on a journey to a wider view of the Query Engine.
Once you understand what physical actions are being taken on your logical requests (i.e. your TSQL Statements) then you will be better placed make changes to influence those actions with an end result of a better performing database system.

## Title: Hadoop's Architecture it's relation to Microsoft Data Platform
 
**Abstract**:
Hadoop is the most widely talked data platform in the recent years. Hiding under the term "Big Data", one of the most disruptive data technology has arrived to the mass market in the recent years, allowing everyone to setup a data solution for everyone.
The initial releases of Hadoop  have had huge deficiencies in the terms of work, performance and organisation, but the Hadoop 2.0 has brought the needed changes in the underlying architecture and its steadily becoming more and more interesting as a multi-purpose data platform.

Let us review what Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Pig, Tez, Ambari and others are and how can we get started with this data platform. Let us connect each of the pieces with the corresponding element in the current Microsoft Data Platform offerings to understand how can we be more effective in learning and understanding Hadoop.

## Title: Fun with SQL Server 2016 Stretch Database, Temporal, and Always Encrypted
 
**Abstract**:
Your cold data growth is getting out of control, storage consumption is increasing faster than your budget, your end-users won't (or can't) tell you what can delete or truncate, but they demand their cold or archived data always be online and available. Now you have tables so big that you dread re-indexing, and you have to look for ever more creative solutions to manage this data, while still remaining compliant. There’s a solution that lets you take advantage of the Cloud, on your terms, all without impacting your existing end-user applications or queries. Come find out how you can move your data securely and transparently, free up disc space and reduce your enterprise storage consumption, while retaining full control from the on-premises SQL Server. You’ll reduce maintenance operations time and resources, plus lower overall cost. Learn how SQL Server Stretch database will simplify your journey to the Cloud!

## Title: How to monitor efficiently your SQL Server instances
 
**Abstract**:
Do you plan to start monitoring your SQL Server instances soon and asking yourself what should you measure? Are you questioning if your existing monitoring data can detect and alert if a performance problem occurs? Is the data you collected from monitoring enough to pinpoint the cause of your next performance problem?

I have worked with SQL Server as a developer in the Redmond team for more than 12 years and during this time I've investigated countless performance problems. In time I developed a strategy on how to use the performance monitoring data to analyze problems and identify the root cause. This session is going to to show you how I monitor SQL Server, what data do I look for, and how I interpret the collected data to analyze performance issues. Going beside the obvious CPU, Memory and IO counters, I will show you how to identify typical performance issues from monitoring data, all without overwhelming the captured data volume.
