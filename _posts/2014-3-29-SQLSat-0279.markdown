## Title: Optimizing SQL Server for SharePoint 
 
**Abstract**:
Knowing the vast majority of the content accessed via SharePoint is stored in SQL Server, and also knowing an incorrect configuration of SQL Server can have a detrimental impact on the performance of SharePoint it is important to understand the integration of these two products. Regardless of whether you have a dedicated DBA, or the SharePoint administrator is also the DBA, there are critical SQL Server configurations that can be made that will improve the performance of SharePoint. Often DBA’s are familiar with how to manage SQL Server, but may not be familiar with some nuances that SQL Server has when integrated with SharePoint. In this session we will demonstrate how some default SQL Server settings negatively impact SharePoint and what changes can be made to improve the performance of SharePoint. These changes include database file settings and SQL Server instance settings. We'll also examine how to properly install SQL Server and SharePoint so they work together efficiently.

## Title: The Sqoop on Big Data from it’s humble beginnings to rise to notoriety
 
**Abstract**:
Everywhere you turn in the technological literature people are talking and writing about Big Data. In this presentation you will learn about the origins of Hadoop, and how it is implemented today. In addition to the most infamous way of retrieving data from Hadoop, Map Reduce, there another way to manipulate the Hadoop data.  It is possible to query the data from Hadoop in SQL Server through the use of Sqoop. In order to better understand the logic behind Sqoop, I will present information on the Hadoop components.  Having this information will help you determine how the tools all fit together so that you will know which tools are the best choice for getting the desired answers from your data sources.

## Title: SQL Server 2012 Master Data Services / Data Quality Services
 
**Abstract**:
Tired of seeing your name spelled 27 different ways... all from the same company?  Tired of making the same corrections over and over and over again?  Would it be better if business users could directly correct data and have the corrections recorded and consistently applied?

Surely someone has come up with a solution to these problems?

Come check out how software you likely already own can solve these problems.

This session was originally presented at SQL Saturday 158 in NYC, but has been enhanced with additional content and all filler has been mercilessly cut, folded, spindled and mutilated.

## Title: Getting Started with Execution Plans
 
**Abstract**:
There are times when you are able to be proactive and tune existing queries. Sometimes, you will receive a phone call from your manager telling you that a certain web page or report is timing out and your users are furious. You need to quickly diagnose what the problem is. Where do you turn to first? When a query is underperforming, hogging resources or timing out, one of the first things you want to examine is the query execution plan. An execution plan provides a wealth of information that can help you quickly diagnose what is wrong. In this beginner level session you will learn what an execution plan is, how to find it, and how to interpret it to see what the query optimizer is doing and find the major pain points.

## Title: Probing into the Microsoft SSIS Model: Reconfiguring SSIS Packages Using an Automated Approach
 
**Abstract**:

While many in the BI realm are comfortable performing SSIS tasks using Microsoft Business Intelligence Studio, there is that other world of exploration that utilizes the SSIS programming interface API. Why use it? In this session we will go over some basic approaches as to how to take advantage of the SSIS  API model to perform package configuration and property changes in an automated manner. This is especially advantageous in enterprise systems that maintain numerous dtsx packages. Automating changes to SSIS packages reduces the amount of development time that otherwise would be spent if one were to go in and manually apply these changes using the graphical interface.

## Title: Introduction to the Hive Query Language for BI Developers
 
**Abstract**:
The Hadoop ecosystem has emerged as the most viable means of working on huge amount of data which is now commonly referred to as “BigData”. The piping- and parallelism approach of breaking heavy tasks in to smaller manageable tasks and executing them in parallel on readily available commodity hardware, relies on the MapReduce programing framework. One of the challenges facing the enterprise BI team is the learning curve in moving from existing solutions built on traditional databases to Hadoop clusters which are primarly designed to be queries using MapReduce programing constructs . Initially developed by Facebook, and used and enhanced by other companies like Netflix and Amazon; the Hive Query Language (HQL), bridges the gap between MapReduce and Traditional SQL. In this presentation I will be discussing the basic commands required to interact with Hadoop File System (HDFS), as well as the fundamental query constructs of Hive. Demos will done on a Hortonworks , Apache Hadoop SandBox.

## Title: Increase your SSIS productivity with Biml
 
**Abstract**:
Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) is an XML language for Microsoft Business Intelligence that can take your Integration Services package development to the next level. Creating template packages added productivity to your Integration Services development effort. If the template design changes after development begins, a fair amount of rework to packages could be needed. See how Biml can help create template packages that can better adapt to changing business needs and allow for more comprehensive design or redesign. 

This session will be a demo based session that will inspire you to make Biml your number one integration services development tool. Learn how to use Biml scripts to create staging tables and integration services packages. Add metadata to your Biml scripts and really watch the possibilities expand.

## Title: Handling Errors and Data Anomalies in SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
Even in the most reliable ETL system, it's eventually going to happen: A package will fail, an output row count won't match what is expected, a data anomaly will force a forensic search of the package infrastructure... In this session, we'll talk about some of the things that can go wrong during package execution - and some of the defenses that can be built into SSIS to help head off those errors (or at least make the errors easier to troubleshoot). From error handlers to package restartability, and from logging methods to row count validation and remediation, we'll cover various ways to keep your ETL flowing when problems arise.

## Title: Getting Started with MDX
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.   This session applies equally to Analysis Services 2008, 2008R2 and 2012.

## Title: What secrets does your table schema hold?
 
**Abstract**:
Data types are the basic building blocks of table design. Using the correct data type can affect data integrity and performance.  Redesign after a table is in production is very difficult, so getting it right when building the table is crucial. 

We begin with discussion on best practices for choosing data types and why the right data type is important for performance and data integrity. We will then run scripts to spotlight inconsistent field lengths and data types as examples of secrets that will be revealed. 

This session will help you design better tables so your data is more stable and reliable. It is also a good review if you will be taking exam 70-461.

Have you ever seen or used “WITH (NOLOCK)” in T-SQL? Do you know what it does and its side effects? Is SQL Server optimistic or pessimistic when it comes to locking? Can it be both? In this session we will cover these questions and discuss how and why SQL Server takes locks and how that affects other users. We will go over alternatives for using NOLOCK and discuss when it is appropriate to use. In addition, we will discuss what are the ACID properties and how to monitor locks and blocks.
