##Title: Data Wrangling for Reporting  Analytics using Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
In today’s world reporting and analytics are no longer focused exclusively on internal data from transactional systems and the data warehouse. 
Mashups using data from partners, commercial and public sources are fast becoming the new normal.
Do you have a csv file too big to open, is a non-windows format or generates errors on import or opening?
Need to determine the quality of a file downloaded from the internet or supplied by another party?
In this presentation we will review tools to examine/repair schema issues and explore Power BI Desktop features that provide insights into your datasets along with the M language for building mashups and data models.

##Title: Microsoft Azure for SQL Server Professionals - Get your head in the cloud##
 
**Abstract**:
Lift and shift is an utopia many IT professionals have about moving on-prem resources to the cloud. The truth is we must understand how the cloud works so we adjust, design accordingly and deliver to expectations. As SQL DBAs we have options. We can choose between IaaS or PaaS, between SQL in a VM or SQL DB, NoSQL options, Azure Data Warehouse some more. In this session we will dive into these options and understand some key points on the platform through some demos. 

You will learn: 
•	Basic elements of Azure cloud ecosystem 
•	VM disks specifics for SQL 2016/2017 
•	Azure SQL Database and Elastic pools 
•	Azure Data Warehouse and Cosmos DB

##Title: Disaster Recovery and High Availability in Azure SQL Database##
 
**Abstract**:
While Azure SQL Database does have built-in safety mechanisms, these are not always well understood. Further, a good architect will ensure redundancy even with an already protected system. This session will show how Azure SQL Database is built and maintained by Microsoft to provide protection for your production information. We’ll also go over methods you can employ to add additional protection to your systems. Moving to the cloud and taking advantage of all that it offers doesn’t mean your data is automatically, fully protected. The knowledge from this session will help to ensure a higher degree of safety, faster recovery, and more up-time for your Azure SQL Databases.

##Title: Data Protection  Privacy in the World of Database DevOps##
 
**Abstract**:
Ensuring the ongoing protection of personally identifiable information is mandatory in today's business, helping you to guard against data breaches, and comply with the GDPR. In a climate where cyber attacks are all too frequent, and data is spread across a growing number of different environments, the challenge of protecting your data can seem daunting.  This session will address the implications of the GDPR on database management, and demonstrate a privacy-first approach to controlling and protecting data as it changes and moves through your SQL Server estate. As well as offering guidance for assessing your data estate for GDPR readiness, this session will include some great tools and tips for building data protection and privacy into your development processes, and dispel the myth that database DevOps and compliance can't go hand in hand. With the right preparation, you can build compliance into your processes, keep sensitive data safe, and deliver value quickly to your end users.

I'm fluent in several languages including: SQL, C#, Python, and PowerShell.

I'm a Microsoft Certified Master of SQL Server (MCM) and have been recognized for my technical excellence and evangelism efforts by Microsoft by being awarded the Most Valuable Professional (MVP) for the last 5+ years.

In my off hours I like to snowboard, karaoke, ride roller coasters, and play arcade games

##Title: Monitoring Linux Performance for the SQL Server Admin##
 
**Abstract**:
So you’re a SQL Server administrator and you just installed SQL Server on Linux. It’s a whole new world. Don’t fear, it’s just an operating system. It has all the same components Windows has and in this session we’ll show you that. We will look at the Linux operating system architecture and show you where to look for the performance data you’re used to! Further we'll dive into SQLPAL and how it architecture and internals enables high performance for your SQL Server. By the end of this session you’ll be ready to go back to the office and have a solid understanding of performance monitoring Linux systems and SQL on Linux. We’ll look at the core system components of CPU, Disk, Memory and Networking monitoring techniques for each and look some of the new tools available including new DMVs and DBFS.

##Title: Dynamic SQL: Tables, Pivots, Parameters  More##
 
**Abstract**:
Dynamic SQL is a scripting language that helps you design flexibility into your code. It allows you to design solutions, pass parameters and allows you build a single query on values passed.  Dynamic SQL has both pros and cons to it's design, but can also be a helpful tool. This presentation will walk through the steps of building dynamic tables, aggregating data in a pivot format and give you the first steps of writing a Dynamic Query.  We will also see how to use Dynamic SQL to build multiple databases across servers, alter a single table in multiple servers and add columns to a table, all through the magic of Dynamic SQL.

##Title: Get TurnedOn with AlwaysOn##
 
**Abstract**:
Once upon a time, there were 2 SQL Solutions named High Availability and Disaster Recovery. They had a love hate relationship and could never find a common ground. That is, until SQL Server 2012 brought them together in a love story built for the ages. When the dust settled, a beautiful new feature was born. It was called AlwaysON and brought with it new technologies like availability groups, read-only mirrors and listeners. It was a perfect blend of both HA and DR all wrapped up in one bundle of joy. 
SQL Server AlwaysOn provides a high-availability and Disaster-recovery solution for SQL Server 2012. Come see and learn some of the new features associated with it, how they work and why this new feature of SQL Server 2012 is so wonderful.

##Title: Always Encrypted for Beginners##
 
**Abstract**:
One of the biggest challenges to successful implementation of data encryption has been the back and forth between the application and the database.  You have to overcome the obstacle of the application decrypting the data it needs.  Microsoft tried to simplify this process when it introduced Always Encrypted (AE) into SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database.  In this demo intense session, you will learn about what Always Encrypted is, how it works, and the implications for your environment. By the end you will know how to now easily encrypt columns of data and just as importantly how to unencrypt. You will also learn about the current limitations of the feature and what your options are to work around them.

##Title: CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming##
 
**Abstract**:
This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.

##Title: Delivering Business Value Faster##
 
**Abstract**:
Every team’s goal is to deliver business value faster, the question is how do you do that? If you’re a small shop with 1 or 2 developers then writing script in test and then running them production may be okay, but for a larger team that leads to problems. Using continuous integration (CI) and deployment techniques you can make small incremental changes which then set off a chain of automation steps that validates the new code. After automated validation, the code changes are ready for any additional User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and staging environments. During this session, you will learn how to manage database schema changes in a dynamic environment and deliver code to production by utilizing continuous integration and certain development techniques in minutes with minimal risk.

##Title: Big Data - The Biggest Fad of the Decade##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will investigate what Big Data really means, and more importantly - what it doesn't mean. What makes Big Data different than any other data? What makes Big Data challenges different than the same old challenges we had 30 years ago? Together, we will perform an honest, inquisitive, and enlightening investigation of what Big Data really is, it's origins, and how it evolved over the last decade. We will use history, analytics and logic to dissect the beast, and expose it for what it really is. Why should you care? The Big Data hype is holding you back from doing what is really important with data - getting value out of it. Making sense of it. Vendors, organizations, and architects have become so obsessed with the 'Big Data' fad, and too many either lost sight, or no longer have the resources to pursue their real goals. In this session I will plea to your reasoning, critical thinking, and plain common sense, to wake up and shout with me "The Emperor has no cloths!!!"

##Title: Why Should I Care About ... Partitioned Views?##
 
**Abstract**:
Partitioned tables are awesome and partitioned views are dead, right? Well, sure partitioned views are not sexy but there are still plenty of applications where they are critical. And not necessarily just for standard edition users who aren't on the new service pack yet. If your data is time stamped, do you see different queries run against older data than new data? Do you with you could segment your data across multiple columns? Do you have data you need to partition horizontally? It's possible partitioned views may still be for you. Come hear why this is still an important topic long after cargo pants and trucker hats went away ... and even after 2016 SP1.

We will also look at the new Mobile Report Publisher app and see how easy it is to create mobile reports.  The session will cover tips for a smart migration to 2016.

The session will then dive into how to use the data in the ReportServer database tables to see which reports in your environment are being used and how well they are performing.  With this understanding you can determine which reports, data sets and data sources to migrate to a new 2016 installation.  Come see how to leverage PowerShell to extract the reports from the database, instead of having to download them from Report Manager, to facilitate an easy migration to a new SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services implementation.

##Title: A Look Inside SQL Server Distribution Statistics##
 
**Abstract**:
Where do the estimated rowcount values come from? We’ll look inside SQL Server’s distribution statistics to see how they are used to come up with the estimates. We’ll explore some of the new metadata that let you see more details about the statistics and the data changes. We’ll see how and when SQL Server’s distribution statistics are updated and what control you have over the updating of statistics.

##Title: SQL Server Databaseology: A Deep Dive Into Database Internals##
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever taken apart a toaster or an alarm clock just to see how it worked? Ever wondered how that database actually functions at the record level, behind the scenes? SQL Server Databaseology is the study of SQL Server databases and their structures down to the very core of the records themselves. In this session, we will explore some of the deep inner workings of a SQL Server database at the record and page level.  You will walk away with a better understanding of how SQL Server stores data and that knowledge will allow you to build better, faster databases.

##Title: CSV files and ETL- The Good, Bad, and Ugly##
 
**Abstract**:
CSV files come in a variety of shapes and sizes. If you’ve been working with them for a while, you will know that not all CSV’s are the same. We will cover methods to perform ETL on CSV’s file utilizing T-SQL and PowerShell. The Good- The simple, easy to load structure. The Bad- It looks good in excel, but I’m having difficulty loading it. The Ugly- You want me to load what monthly? That file it too big and it’s structure changes too often.

##Title: Mom Rules for Managing Enterprise Database Environments##
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever looked at an environment and wondered how the heck they ever got anything done because it is so disorganized? The first thing I do for newly inherited environments is implement some organization and do some database clean up.  Not only does organization make the environment easier to maintain, it can help speed up trouble shooting.  Good organization can even help with some performance issues.
