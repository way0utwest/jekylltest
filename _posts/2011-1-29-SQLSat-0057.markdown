## Title: SSIS: Configuring, Deploying and a Little Tuning
 
**Abstract**:
Typically, you develop SSIS packages on your laptop, desktop or some client machine and then deploy them to a server. In most cases these environments are completely different. They may have different machine names, folders, connection strings, etc… To assist in easing the pain of deploying your SSIS packages, SSIS includes a range of options that help you when building your data integration solutions. In this session I will attempt to demystify the usage of Configurations file in your SSIS package with a particular focus on Child and Master package solutions.  In addition, I will discuss the native deployment methods that are available for SSIS packages.  Finally, I will disucss a few methods that can be used to improve the performance.

**Abstract**:
You will walk away from this session with an understanding of how to use the Policy Based Management and Central Management Server to complete a daily checklist against your whole SQL Server farm. We will cover the basics to evaluate, monitor and apply best practice policies, which are included out of the box with SQL Server 2008. We will also make custom policies to cover additional best practices to evaluate daily checklist items. Finally, we will combine Policy-Based Management and Central Management Server with the Enterprise Policy Management Framework on codeplex to automate the monitoring process and create manager friendly reports to moni

## Title: Putting the Development back in SharePoint Develop
 
**Abstract**:
The goal of this session is to discuss how to structure and plan a Visual Studio solution for a SharePoint development project.  I will discuss some of the coding patterns and practices that we at Envoc have found lead to a high quality product for our clients.  We'll talk about how these patterns and practices allow us to bring a diverse skill set to our project teams due to the minimization of touch points with SharePoint and how automated integration tests help us troubleshoot deployment issues.

## Title: Transition from DBA to BI Architect 
 
**Abstract**:
Database Normalization and Dimension Modeling are the same but different. Development in today ‘s larger industries require the design and analysis of Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) to take into account Data Warehousing/OLAP (Online Analytical Processing). My transition from Senior DBA to BI Architect at Amedisys has been a process of sanding the rough edges of my passion from fully normalized databases. The Dimensional Modeling started a re-tooling of my mind to look at end result analytics/statistics from smaller and smaller transactions. From previous experience, I know I am not going to get it right the first time. Lessons learned will mold me into a great BI Guy.

## Title: T-SQL Code Sins: The Worst Things We Do to Code
 
**Abstract**:
It's impossible to follow every best practice all the time. "Code sins" are those things we do to our code that are either so horrendous that they can't be borne, or that have such tremendous consequences that your stored procedures wish they'd never been created. Attendees will hear about the most common code sins that make code difficult to read, support, run and extend, and practical strategies for reversing the trend.

## Title: Getting Started with MDX
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.

## Title: Beginning Powershell for DBAs 1.0
 
**Abstract**:
The time has come where DBAs can no longer afford to ignore powershell.  Not only has it become an integral part of SQL Server, but we’re being asked to do things on a much grander scale than ever before; things that can only be done with powershell.  This session will take you from nothing  and explain what powershell is all about.  I’m going to show you how the more things change the more they stay the same and if you master the basics of powershell in this session, you’ll be able to work with powershell not only in SQL Server, but also at the file system level, in Exchange, IIS, Windows, and anything else.  So in this session I’m going to show you the basics you need to get your powershell career started.

## Title: Documenting Your Integrated Microsoft BI Solution
 
**Abstract**:
Having implemented BI solutions for years, I have found documentation to be a task too often resisted until late in the project, when it is hastily and incompletely prepared in remaining hours. Because the integrated Microsoft BI solution comprises multiple application layers, it is challenging to generate documentation about the whole solution in a single, unified document.   In this presentation I will share approaches I’ve come to use in assembling documentation that “covers all the bases.”

## Title: Microsoft Entity Framework 4.0 for DBAs
 
**Abstract**:
While most enterprise applications are object-oriented, the data upon which they depend is not. Binding these platforms together can be costly and time-consuming.

Recently, Microsoft released the Entity Framework and is now recommending development teams implement it in their applications to bridge data and objects.
 
Come and better understand the Entity Framework, as we … 
 
•	Explore Entity Framework 4.0 and show how it works
•	Demonstrate various ways to build and maintain Entity Data Models and mappings
•	Walk through examples that interact with the model, including LINQ, Entity SQL and Stored Procedures
•	Explore its on permissions, connections, transactions, performance, security and concurrency

## Title: Bad SQL
 
**Abstract**:
How do you tell good code from bad?  Bad SQL code makes the system work harder for the same results.  Bad SQL does not scale well with larger data sizes, nor does it scale with increased server activity.  Extreme Bad SQL can bring a server to a grinding halt.   This presentation shows you how and why certain commonly used SQL constructions are Bad SQL.  Bad SQL is not very useful by itself so each example includes its Good SQL counterpart.
