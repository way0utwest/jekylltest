## Title: RC, SI, and RCSI, Oh My! –We're off to see the Wizard -to understand how it all works.
 
**Abstract**:
I'm just going to say it straight out. I'm pessimistically optimistic that most really understand transaction concurrency in SQL Server. There is often significant confusion about transaction concurrency and contention options available to Developers -is it 'pessimistic', or 'optimistic', or in between? Everyone ‘sort of’ understands READ COMMITTED (RC). But do you sometimes feel 'dirty' as you attempt to 'repeatedly' read that phantasma? In order to reduce locking and blocking conflicts, some folks adopt SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (SI). And a few hardy stalwarts have ventured into the new world of READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (RCSI). In this session, we will explore the differences between the three, including a discussion about the positives and negatives of each option. We will discuss the effects of 'Dirty', 'Repeatable' and 'Phantom' reads, and why you may want to know which may be buried in your code. There will be code examples demonstrating the benefits and traps of each option.

## Title: DevOps for the DBA - Bridging the Gap Between Infrastructure, Administration, and Development
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps is a term that has come to mean many things to many people. At its core, this important concept represents a way to remove old barriers between the infrastructure, application, and development tiers within an IT organization. An understanding of scripting and automation platforms is becoming a critical skill for SQL Server Database Administrators. Additionally, as hardware is increasingly virtualized, new opportunities for scripted deployment and configuration are available. This session will utilize demos to illustrate the many ways SQL Database Administrators can automate routine tasks from deployment through configuration.

## Title: End-to-End SQL Server Master Data Services
 
**Abstract**:
This session will be co-presented by Peter Myers and Matt Masson.  This session describes how SQL Server 2012 or 2014 Master Data Services can be used to implement Master Data Management (MDM). It introduces the discipline of MDM and maps common processes to the feature set of Master Data Services. It also introduces the new capabilities and features planned for SQL Server 2016.

Topics include defining models, entities, attributes and hierarchies, to store and manage master data. Additionally, administrative tasks including business rules to validate data, the import and export of master data, model versioning, and permission management will be described. The two Microsoft user interfaces (the Master Data Manager web application, and the Excel add-in) will be covered, in addition to T-SQL scripting opportunities to automate processes.

## Title: Case Study: How answers.microsoft.com Overcame the key Challenges of Upgrading to SQL Server 2014 
 
**Abstract**:
As part of the company’s “Get Current/Stay Current” initiative, Microsoft’s IT organization planned to upgrade its community website, answers.microsoft.com from Microsoft SQL Server 2008 to Microsoft SQL Server 2014. At the same time, the site adopted virtualization and needed to maintain the zero downtime environment the group had built with mirroring. Given the site spans four data centers across the globe and supports more than 1.7 million visitors a day, Microsoft cannot afford downtime, not even for maintenance. This case study details the steps taken to migrate answers.microsoft.com from SQL Server 2008 to 2014, the technologies considered to enable continuous availability, and how the site leveraged AlwaysOn without making application changes. This presentation will be led by ScaleArc’s CTO Varun Singh and will include commentary from Michael Schaeffer, the Senior Service Engineer at Microsoft who manages answers.microsoft.com and architected the upgrade to SQL Server 2014.

## Title: Exploring SQL Server  Join Types – INNER, OUTER, and much more
 
**Abstract**:
Joining tables is one of the fundamental aspects of any relational database, but the different ways of joining tables are often misunderstood.
Learn about INNER JOINS, OUTER JOINS (LEFT, RIGHT and FULL), OUTER JOIN with exclusions, CROSS JOIN. Also find out how multiple INNER JOINS impact your result set versus multiple OUTER JOINS.
By the end of this presentation you will at a minimum you will be able to answer that common interview of “explain the difference between an INNER JOIN and an OUTER JOIN”.

## Title: Tabular Models: Easier  Faster Than Cubes; Really? 
 
**Abstract**:
The future of data analysis is the new, in-memory xVelocity Tabular analytic engine but is this new product ready for enterprise solutions? Is it easier to build Tabular models than multidimensional cubes in SQL Server 2012? Maybe… It depends on what you need to do. Is it faster? Heck, yea. Taking off the Microsoft BI marketing hat, let’s take a tabular journey together and learn some lessons from the first generation of real, enterprise-scale solutions: The Good, the Bad, the Ugly and the Beautiful.

## Title: Practical Fundamentals of Query Performance Tuning
 
**Abstract**:
Do you need to write some queries and not sure how to make sure they will perform well? Do you already have some poorly performing queries and don’t know where to start to improve them? In this session I’ll start with a little bit of optimizer basics, then show you how to avoid some query writing pitfalls that result in poor performance. I’ll then show you how to read the execution plan and use other tools to help identify why a query is performing poorly, and how to fix it. I’ll have several examples of how seemingly insignificant changes to a query can have drastic effect on performance.

## Title: Best Practices for Upgrading to SQL Server 2014
 
**Abstract**:
When Microsoft’s own IT department was looking to upgrade to SQL Server 2014, the team faced a variety of challenges, including overcoming some limitations in AlwaysOn. The primary concern was to avoid the application rewrites necessary to take advantage of the scaled out solution. This presentation will detail the steps the team supporting answers.microsoft.com took to streamline and accelerate the project. Specifically, it will discuss how Microsoft enabled auto failover across data centers while avoiding app errors during failover, achieved automatic read/write split, delivered geo-aware load balancing, enabled zero-downtime maintenance, and supported 8x the original traffic capacity of the deployment.

## Title: 5+ Database Design Blunders and How To Avoid Them
 
**Abstract**:
What’s going on in your physical data model? How many people can or will update it to match the reality of what’s going on in your databases? Who actually decides what goes into the database design?  How do you choose your primary keys? How do you implement them? Are your datatypes the right ones for the data?  Are you thinking about the full lifecycle of data? 

In this presentation we discuss five physical data modeling mistakes that cost you dearly: performance snags, development delays, bugs, and professional respect.

## Title: WHAT HA/DR OPTION(S) ARE RIGHT FOR YOU
 
**Abstract**:
Your manager comes to you and asks you to setup your production SQL Server environment so that you have a level of High Availability plus you need to design and implement a Disaster Recovery strategy.
It may sound like an exam question, but it’s something that a DBA gets asked frequently.
Do you understand the relative strengths of the various HA/DR technologies, such as Availability Groups, Failover Cluster Instances, Mirroring, Log Shipping and Replication?
In this talk we will cover the various options, what the strengths and weaknesses are for each, and help you to go back to your manager with a plan.
