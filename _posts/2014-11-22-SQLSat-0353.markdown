##Title: VBA: More than Macros##
 
**Abstract**:
Excel has been the main tool for presenting data in a digestible form almost forever. The wealth of facilities on top of the basic spreadsheet functions have helped to power Excel to this position, and to keep it there. As well as the bread and butter spreadsheet function, there are facilities for querying databases, filtering data, grouping, charting, pivoting, and many, many more. Even Microsoft have realised Excel's role, adding more data analysis/BI/BA functionality in the latest Excel releases, 2010, 2013 and Office 365. Even with all of this richness, it's still never enough is it? Sometimes it just doesn't do the thing(s) you need it to do now.You want to do something and it is not in the Excel tool-set? With VBA you can create custom functions, trap use action, format/modify data, even build a complete application.In this session, we are going to build such an application. It will be fast-paced and quite intensive, but all of the files will be made available afterwards.

##Title: Using Slicers in Excel 2013##
 
**Abstract**:
Many people have been put off using Slicers as they think they consume too much of the screen “real estate”, and are plain ugly. This is very true when used straight “out of the box”, and Microsoft have not made it easy to expose the methods of formatting them into objects which can be very pleasing on the eye as well as effective in filtering data.This session will show users how they can format Slicers, and some of the pitfalls and workarounds when trying to group some data items – especially dates.The session will then continue showing how Slicers can be used in Excel 2010 and later to control multiple Pivot Tables with a single click, as opposed to having to write VBA as in previous Excel versions.It will then include information on how to use Slicers with The Table object, which has been made available since Excel 2013. Coupled with the use of the Aggregate function, this can provide a very useful method of summarising data without having to create a Pivot Table first.

A closer and critical look at Excel’s standard charts: which ones are useful, whichones are less useful and which shouldn’t be uses at all (and why?)Presentation of a selection of useful non-default charts include: Description of the chart type (Tornado, Waterfall, etc.): what is it good for? Showcase: a real use case for this chart type combination charts / dual axes formulas and NV data series dummy data series invisible data series formatting tricks error barsPossible further use cases for this chart type in business and science.Although none of the presented charts are available in Excel by default, the necessarytweaks and hacks are all based on Exce

##Title: Hurdles between modeling Excel power pivot models towards SQL Power pivot models##
 
**Abstract**:
Topics:•	Excel Power pivot models: which paths are available?•	Using Excel as prototyping tool and Visual Studio as application building tool.•	The difference between applications, made by the SQL professionals and Excel users.•	Recognize some of the pitfalls in the migration process from Excel to other platforms.•	What will be the role of the Excel user during and after migration to VS.It is very easy to port your Excel Power pivot model to SQL server, Analytic Server and then return the results to Excel of a SharePoint server. Technical spoken no sweat at all, piece of cake. But looking closer at a practical point of view there are many hurdles to be taken in the process. So why should you, as SQL expert,  accept Excel Power pivot models as a source of professional applications? What are there benefits? How can you support the Excel user?

##Title: Keynote: Data Culture : From BI  Analytics to Big Data and Data Science##
 
**Abstract**:
In this mobile-first, cloud-first era – data is at the intersection – with apps, devices and sensors creating tremendous volumes of data.  To get value out of that data, we must be able to reason over it,  tap into processing power to quickly analyze it and accelerate the insights,  which ultimately lead to better decisions, actions and business results. Companies that put data at the heart of their business operations outperform those that don’t by a significant margin, which we call releasing the ‘Data Dividend’.  We will take a walk through the key technologies from PowerBI to AzureML and IoT to show how to start driving your Data Culture.

##Title: Power Query: Beyond The Basics##
 
**Abstract**:
You already know that you can accomplish a lot within the Power Query user interface. If you are a data steward, however, you may be asked to deliver complex data sets in Power Query that require some knowledge of advanced functionality, including the M language. This session will examine what these requirements might be, how to implement them, and how best to deploy them to end users. We will cover how to create common types of calculations in M, how to best use functions, calling to web services, and OData data sources, and more. We will also discuss the best way to use Power Query with the rest of the Power BI stack, especially PowerPivot.

##Title: Using R, Cubes And Data Visualisation To Answer “What If” Questions##
 
**Abstract**:
Many BI projects aim to tell us “what happened?” but sometimes the more interesting question is “what would happen if?”.  To do this we have to generate some plausible scenarios and model our business under these scenarios and then communicate the results effectively.  This talk will present one small example of this.  We will generate the scenarios using R, an open source language for munging data and stats.  We’ll organise the results in a SQL Server database and an Analysis Services cube so that we can compare the different outcomes of each scenario.  Finally we’ll use Power View to explore and visualise the results.
