## Title: SQL Server 2016 – The Evolution of In-Memory Technologies
 
**Abstract**:
For SQL Server 2014 a completely new In-Memory Engine for memory optimized table  indexes was integrated into SQL Server with in fact very limited functionality.
For SQL Server 2016 the In-Memory engine is being extensively improved in terms of both scalability as well as T-SQL language support. Moreover the ColumnStore index technology has been improved and can now even be combined with memory-optimized tables.
In this session, Microsoft Certified Master Andreas Wolter, will provide an overview of the new possibilities and demonstrate where a particular technology may help – or where you cannot expect benefits. If you are planning to go on SQL Server 2016 any time soon, this session shows you two of the most important features that SQL Server 2016 brings.

## Title: SQL Server 2016 Stretch Database: top to bottom
 
**Abstract**:
Got tables with millions or billions of rows but can't truncate or archive to reduce their sizes? How is that affecting your maintenance window, performance and availability? Is your CIO/CFO mandating DBAs to leverage "cheap", "elastic compute/storage capacity" and "infinite scale" capabilities of the cloud after reading the glossy brochures? Do your users want all data, including cold/archive data always online? All this while IT budgets remain flat or are being reduced?

Find out how StretchDB can help solve some of these problems by leveraging Azure without requiring application changes in most cases. We will cover core StretchDB scenarios, recommended use cases and non-use cases. We walk through key tasks involved in enabling a database for stretch, query behavior, security model and impact to existing high availability and disaster recovery processes. We will then review existing limitations, workarounds and some recommended practices based on lessons learned from early adopters.

## Title: Automated and Repeatable Test Cases for SQL Server Development.
 
**Abstract**:
Automated and repeatable test cases are required for agile software development.  In this session we will look at some of the tools and techniques for automated testing with SQL Server.  Demonstrations during the session will create tests using the Visual Studio toolset and discuss how they can be used for Test Driven Development (TDD), unit testing, integration testing and acceptance testing.  The presentation will cover testing SQL Server Databases, SQL Server Analysis Services and SQL Server Integration Services.  Following the session attendees will be able to incorporate these tools and practices into their projects.

## Title: Bleed Blue for the clouds – SQL Azure
 
**Abstract**:
Bleed Bright Blue for the clouds in the Sky. Yes I would be presenting Microsoft Azure and how SQL Server DBA's can benefit with Azure as your platform. This session would introduce you to Microsoft SQL Azure and helps to put Production DBA's mind at ease that their jobs will not be going away with Azure. This session would give a complete clarity and good foundation of where to start and what would be the next step with the Azure. It would cover on how to plan for Azure and demonstrate on DTU Calculator on Azure suitability and also important tools that are very handy and crucial to understand.

## Title: Secrets of SQL Server - Database Worst Practices
 
**Abstract**:
“OMG! What did I do?” Chances are you have heard, or even uttered, this expression. This demo-oriented session will show many examples where database professionals were dumbfounded by their own mistakes, and could even bring back memories of your own early DBA days. The goal of this session is to expose the small details that can be dangerous to the production environment and SQL Server as a whole, as well as talk about worst practices and how to avoid them. In this session we will focus on some of the common errors and their resolution. Developers will walk out with scripts and knowledge that can be applied to their servers, immediately post the session.

## Title: Know What Your Code is Doing to SQL Server!
 
**Abstract**:
ORMs - oh how I LOVE them! As a consultant when I see them in play at a client I go KACHIIINNNNGGGG!! :-D Seriously though, they can provide some substantial benefits for coding throughput. But if you don't Read The Fine Manual and do some things right and avoid some major gotchas you will fall prey to one of my favorite Guruisms: "Anything that allows developers to slap code together more quickly is inversely proportional to the performance and scalability you will get from that code"! Although this talk is based on Entity Framework, most ORMs suffer from a lot of the same flaws.

## Title: Think  work like a Data Scientist with SQL 2016 R
 
**Abstract**:
What are these DATA Scientists up to? How can we see their statistical model in our day to day familiar tool like Microsoft SQL Server?

You now have answers to these questions and thanks to Microsoft for integrating R Revolution within new SQL Server 2016. We all now have the opportunity to use R packages and see the results within SQL 2016.

In this session, you will definitely take away a breakthrough concept of Advanced R Analytics within SQL 2016 and get ready to kick your creative horse, and go beyond your imagination on how you can build advanced analytics and impress your employers/customers.

## Title: Common TSQL Mistakes
 
**Abstract**:
We are going to examine a variety of oopsies MANY developers fall prey too - some obvious, some pretty subtle and some down right sneaky! Lots of code examples with the bad AND good code presented. I GUARANTEE that you will find things here that will either prevent you from getting bad data, throwing unwanted errors or vastly improving your database application's performance.  I have given this talk over SEVENTY times now and it is always very highly rated!

## Title: Rock Your Reports with SSRS 2016
 
**Abstract**:

SQL Server Reporting Services has really come a long way with great changes and overhauls. New capabilities  features introduced with release of SQL Server 2016 are just amazing. In this session, we would touch base some of the top features  capabilities offered by SSRS 2016. We will see how much we can do with it to make our Reporting simple and powerful.

## Title: Security with SQL Server - Things you never knew
 
**Abstract**:
Compliance and auditing are some of the core tenants around which SQL Server based applications can be built. But understanding the intracacies of each of these fundamentals is critical to both developers and administrators alike. Come to this fun filled, demo centric and interesting session where we unearth some of these fine prints in understanding why we use SQL Server the way we use it and build the system is the most secure and locked down mode. Some of the enhancements with SQL Server 2016 make it even more compelling to look at SQL Server from a security standpoint.

## Title: SQL Server Performance Tuning - Parallelism 
 
**Abstract**:
During query optimization, SQL Server is looking for queries or index operations that might benefit from parallel execution. This session will give you a better understanding of parallelism in SQL Server. The default server configurations are no longer enough for controlling parallelism, as a DBA, you need to know how to tweak the settings to make it run optimally. When parallelism goes wrong, it can cause performance problems to SQL Server. Sometimes only for a particular query, sometimes it can hurt performance server-wide. What is best practices to MAXDOP.

## Title: Data Storage and Analytics with Azure Data Lake
 
**Abstract**:
With all the capabilities required to make life for developers, data scientists, and analysts a tad simpler this session will investigate how we can use Azure Data Lake to store data of any size, shape and speed, and do all types of processing and analytics across platforms and languages. 

A demo rich session we will see how we can use Azure Data Lake to solve many of the productivity and scalability challenges that prevent you from maximizing the value of your data assets.

## Title: Index Internals
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we'll dig into the internal structures of indexes.  We will look at how SQL Server Navigates through the index. We'll look at the various types of pages within the index and how SQL Server uses these different pages to access your data.  We'll look at what happens within the index as data changes.  There will be lots of demos using undocumented commands as we dive into the depths of the database pages.
