## Title: An Introduction to ASP.NET MVC
 
**Abstract**:
ASP.NET MVC is Microsoft's implementation of an old design pattern, which fits web development better than ASP.NET does. It simplifies multiple aspects of web development that were complex in ASP.NET. It also gives ASP.NET developers a better and more accurate abstraction layer over the web. For example it doesn't use the problematic ViewState object. It removes most of the overly complex page lifecycle and it simplifies the ability to unit test web requests.

In this presentation we'll explain the MVC terminology and then we'll explore how to work with Controllers, Actions, Views and the Model. Then we'll walk though a real but simple ASP.NET MVC site so you can leave this session with enough knowledge to start a new ASP.NET MVC project.

## Title: Introduction to PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
PowerShell is Microsoft's next-generation command-line shell and scripting language. In this session we will discuss why you need it, how to use it, and what makes it different from any other shell on any platform. For administrators, Microsoft is investing heavily in PowerShell as the hub for its Windows Server products, starting with Exchange 2007 and SQL Server 2008. For developers, PowerShell provides full access to .NET for Read-Eval-Print loops (REPL), rapid prototyping, object exploration and extensibility. We will take a quick look at features for both groups before diving into an interactive demo, so come prepared with questions you have or problems we can solve together.

Familiarity with OLTP systems

Goals:
1.	Identify situations where partitioned tables can improve database performance
2.	Demonstrate  partitioned table solution for daily imports
3.	Provide understanding of the pro’s and con’s to selecting partitioned tables as a import solution for an OLTP system

**Abstract**:
There are many ways to performance monitor your SQL Server environment.  In this session we’ll review Extended Events, which is one of the newer SQL Server monitoring platforms.  Learn the ins and outs of how to get detailed information on the errors and events that occur within SQL Server and how to dig into the information.  With a few T-SQL statements, issues that could take weeks to research can be investigated in minutes.  

Prerequisites
Understanding of performance issues that can occur in SQL Server
Mid-level skills writing T-SQL code

Goals:
1.	Define the architecture for Extended Events

## Title: SQL Server 2008 R2 - Moving to the Next Level
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2008 provided us with many features that developers and database administrators have been asking about for years.  Separate Date and Time data types, sparse columns, FILESTREAM and compression for both data and backups have made the platform better than ever.  So how do you build on a platform that strong?  By adding features like multi-server management, application management and complex event processing, of course.  Come along with me as we explore these new features with the August CTP of SQL Server 2008 R2.

## Title: Tips Tricks For Administering SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Having had to support a large number of SQL Server instances as a solo DBA for many years I've developed a toolbox of scripts that I rely on to give me insight into disk space, database file growth, backup status, job status, and login management.  Some of these I've shared on mssqltips.com, others are seeing the public light for the first time.  Attendees go home with scripts they can immediately put to use in their organizations.

## Title: Drive Your Way to the DMV
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft SQL Server provides a wealth of information at your fingertips through Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) and Dynamic Management Functions (DMFs).  Information that was used difficult or pert near impossible to obtain is now at your fingertips.  Unfortunately there are many find DMVs and DMFs mysterious.  Step under SQL Servers hood and find answers to some common issues through DMVs and DMFs.  From sessions to caches, this presentation will provide a walk-through of some of the more useful DMVs and a take practical look at how they can be used?

Prerequisites
Understanding of database administration functions

Goals:
1.	Provide a definition of key DMVs within SQL Server

## Title: ABCs of CTEs
 
**Abstract**:
Common Table Expressions (CTE) aren’t as common as their name implies.  CTEs are often seen as a secret part of the dark art of recursion.  This session will explore CTEs to show how they can be extremely useful in improving performance and legibility of T-SQL code.  And, of course, we will look at their use in returning recursive data.

Prerequisites
Understand of basic T-SQL coding
	
Goals:
Provide an understanding of the purpose and use of CTEs for recursion and derived tables
Define the pro’s and con’s to using CTEs in recursion and for derived tables
Demonstrate real-world examples detailing methods for using CTEs to solve coding challenges

## Title: Introduction to Database Mirroring
 
**Abstract**:
Database mirroring was introduced as a new database-scoped high-availability option in SQL Server 2005 and has quickly become a popular alternative to database clustering and log shipping. We will look at what makes database mirroring a particularly inviting option, the basics behind the technology and implementation as well as discuss first-hand the caveats we discovered during the implementation of database mirroring at the University of Iowa.

## Title: Database Design
 
**Abstract**:
In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).

We will go over the basic architecture of service broker and the tricks to get it implemented right, the first time.

## Title: SQL Server 2008 - Practical Uses for New Features
 
**Abstract**:
When learning a new technology, I like to try to solve a real-world problem that will help me not only learn but also help me in my daily life.  Learning SQL Server 2008 was no exception for me.  Through the building of an electronic recipe box, I have taken advantage of many of the new features of SQL Server 2008 – including sparse columns, filestream, table-valued parameters, the MERGE statement and even spatial data.  Come learn from my experiences as we walk through the design and development of this application – and you can even have the code when we’re done!

## Title: Database Design Patterns
 
**Abstract**:
Beyond database design fundamentals (for example, Normalization) lies the area where you have to create "real" solutions.  In this session, I will cover a good number of patterns that we commonly find useful to try to apply to the problem of building a database solution. Ideas like generalization, subclassing, single table domain tables, optional data, and more will be discussed, some of them good, some not so good (don't assume which will be which), but all that are common and/or useful for your database implementations.
