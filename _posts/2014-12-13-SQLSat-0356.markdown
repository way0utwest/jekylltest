##Title: ORM Tuning From A Database Perspective##
 
**Abstract**:
Most ORM's tend to be very chatty and generate complex queries. Which is not a bad thing most of the time, but sometimes it get's out of hand and the queries will either be too complex or, and this I see the most, there will be way to many queries to answer relatively simple questions. Seeing thousands of queries for a simple webpage is not uncommon.

In this session we will look at optimising database access in ORM's. Using Nhibernate, LINQ  Entity Framework in the demos, we will examine how your ORM talks to the database and why.

We will look at this problem from 2 sides. As a developer who would like to tweak and tune as little as possible and let the ORM do it's magic, and as a DBA who would like all queries to ask only for the data that you need to have at that time. Using a lot of demo's we will be looking at typical ORM features like Lazy Loading, Mapping, Caching, Inverse Relationships, etc. 

We will conclude with some best practices and lessons learned.

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

##Title: Deadlocks 2.0. Everything that developer needs to know##
 
**Abstract**:
It's no secret that a deadlock - it's not very good. This is an exceptional situation, when two concurrent queries request same resources, but in a different order. Classic deadlock can occur when two concurrent transactions modifying data from the two tables in a different order. Unfortunatelly in real life deadlocks can be more complex and unobvious. One of the rules, which I always keep in mind, sounds: " You can not design a database, in which the occurrence of deadlock is impossible". So we should deal with them. The algorythm is following: catch, analyze, fix. The most challenging and interesting here is the analysis part. Once you understand why it was occured, you can fix it. In this session we will focus on the analysis of complex,

##Title: A deep dive into SQL Server Plan Cache Management  ##
 
**Abstract**:
As an experienced DBA you have probably asked yourself questions like how the memory is consumed, is my system well-tuned, and is my memory configuration well defined. In order to understanding such processes as local and global Memory pressure, caches concurrency, adding and removing plans from cache we will go through the internal organization of the plan cache, the metadata available, how SQL Server finds a plan in cache, plan cache sizing, and the plan eviction policy. We will point out the important cache consumers that affect your workload and how to get metadata about them, what are the thresholds in Cache Size Management. At the end you will understand how to monitor the memory consumers in your SQL Server, what are wait types that we need to look for, how to understand if your system is well-tuned and the memory configuration is well defined

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

##Title: Reporting Services with Geospatial Visualization##
 
**Abstract**:
Reporting Services with Geospatial Visualization 
specifically: „from address data to data-presentation in SSRS Mapcontrol in 3 steps.“ Each company has address data in the relational form [street], [postcode] und [place]. In a first step the transition to Geodata is presented in the form of longitude and latitude. The question of data source and data quality is also an issue addressed in this section. The next step deals with the selection of appropriate maps. Of special note is the data-matching of the maps with the address data. Also the own production of map sections will be illustrated in an example. The third step is to conduct the use and configuration of the control and the reference to the report data

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

##Title: Database Replication - What, How and Why##
 
**Abstract**:
Database replication doesn't get much attention, especially now that the AlwaysOn features have been released into the wild.  

However, replication offers another way to make data available on multiple servers/locations that steps outside of "normal" HA/DR scenarios.

This session will explain what database replication is, what the different parts are that make up the replication architecture and when/why you would use replication.

The content will be valid for all versions of SQL Server from 2005 onward.

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Developing a SSAS solution for multi-lingual environments requires some additional attention. It's not just the SSAS objects (measures, dimensions, etc.) that need to be translated. There are a lot of details: How to best handle translations of junk dimension members (statuses, codes, etc.)? And what about different regional formatting (dates, numbers)? How to handle multiple currencies?

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

##Title: AlwaysOn for Multi-site  multi-subnet##
 
**Abstract**:
Building a strong HA/DR solution with SQL Server has never been easier, however when you want to start looking at multi-site and multi-subnet clusters or Availability Groups there are some important things you need to consider. In this session I will show you how to handle some of these considerations and work though getting a reliable multi-site configuration in place without the need for things like stretch VLANs or SAN replication.

We will also look at some of the performance  failover scenarios that you might encounter and just what you should look to do when you need to go to DR.

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

##Title: INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE - deep dive##
 
**Abstract**:
DML is used in  most cases without thinking about the multiple operations for the db engine. This session will give a deep dive into the internal storage engine down to record level.
After finishing the theory (and inside the theory) the differen DML commands and their tremendous operational tasks for the db engine will be investigated.
SEE, what a workload will be caused by a "forwarded record". What tremendous workload will occur in a page split. What happens if an existing record will be updated in fixed length attributes

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

##Title: Responding to extended events in near real time##
 
**Abstract**:
Extended events are really useful for gathering information not available otherwise. However, compared to other technologies such as trace and event notifications, it seems to be lacking a way to react to the events as soon as they happen. In this session we will see how this is possible using the APIs and which new possibilities this approach enables.
