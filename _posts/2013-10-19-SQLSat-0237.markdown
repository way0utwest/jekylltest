##Title: Inferred Dimension Members within MDS and SSIS ##
 
**Abstract**:
Combining Master Data Services with Data Warehouses, will cause some challenges in ETL Scenarios. In this session we will go through a demo of Inferred Dimension Members implementation with SSIS considering the fact that MDS keeps the single version of truth for the dimension record.
In this session you will learn how we will write back new record's data into MDS entity as an Inferred member. The staging structure of Master Data Services and Batch Processing will be used for this. Then you will learn what is the best practice to add the inferred record into Data Warehouse dimension. Updating the existing dimension member also would consider the Inferred member and apply SCD types only if this is not an inferred Member.

##Title: Dive into the Query Optimizer-Undocumented Insight##
 
**Abstract**:
This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.

##Title: Change Data Capture tool for BI,Auditing,DR  more##
 
**Abstract**:
Change Data Capture (CDC) is one of the newest features available since SQL Server 2008 which allows you to easily track and keep history of all DML (Data Manipulation Language) changes on user tables such as INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE without additional overhead. One of the most important benefits of this feature is that it allows you to see the data before  after an UPDATE statement which allows you to recover data overwritten or deleted quickly without the need of a database restore. On this presentation we will go over the steps necessary to configure CDC and do an overview of some real world scenarios where this feature can be applied such as in ETL for Business Intelligence, Disaster Recovery, Auditing, and more.

##Title: Understand Evaluation Contexts in DAX##
 
**Abstract**:
DAX is the query and programming language for future Microsoft BI solutions, yet many users found DAX hard to learn because they couldn't grasp what the "context" was. This session will turn you into a DAX expert by mastering this core concept of DAX. You will learn what row contexts and filter contexts are and how to access them. You will learn functions which create row and filter contexts. You will learn the initial contexts of a calculated column expression, a row level security expression, and a measure expression. You will learn how initial contexts are created from an MDX query. You will learn how to manipulate filter contexts using the overwrite and intersect semantics. You will see a lot of examples and learn a few DAX tricks along the way.

##Title: DANGER: The Art and Science of Presenting##
 
**Abstract**:
Is there a great difference in the brain chemistry of someone fleeing a hungry mountain lion and someone presenting to a group of colleagues in a corporate board room? The answer is: NO. Over the past decade, a lot has been learned about the chemistry of the brain and why humans react the way we do to events in our environment. The concept of EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is a compelling and growing concept that applies this knowledge in a set of learnable, improvable skills for leading human beings. While EQ is often applied to corporate leadership, the parallels to presenting are fantastic. This session will explain the basics of EQ and demonstrate how you can apply it to make your presentations better in the following areas: * Crafting better slide decks * Preparing yourself for presenting * Delivering your content * Dealing with the unexpected Understanding and practicing the concepts of EQ can make your presentations a better experience for everyone in the room--including you.

##Title: Data Visualisation with Hadoop Mashups, Power View and Excel 2013##
 
**Abstract**:
The Hadoop ecosystem is a valuable tool for Business Intelligence and Data Visualisation practitioners. It allows you to mashup unstructured data from Hadoop with structured data from more traditional relational and multi-dimensional sources. For Business Intelligence practitioners, this is an excellent tool to gain new business insights, and overcome data silos that come from within the organisation, whilst freeing you to make use of external data sources too.
Join us at this session in order to see how your Big Data can empower your business users via familiar Business Intelligence tools such as Excel and Power View.

##Title: Scalable SSRS Reports Achieved Through the Powerful Tablix##
 
**Abstract**:
Want to quickly roll out ultra-flexible reports that will wow your end users? Want to learn how to display the data in multiple layouts on the same report? Want to consolidate similar reports while still providing flexibility to your end users? This can all be achieved by leveraging the three controls based on the Tablix template: Table, Matrix, and the List control. 

In this demo-heavy session, you'll learn how to create a columnar report that grows vertically as well as horizontally. You'll see the magic of having multiple layouts for the same data on the same report. You'll see how to do more useful things with fewer reports, and you’ll come away with a bag full of new tricks to make your reports flexible and scalable works of art.

##Title: MDS and DQS - Beyond the TLAs to Data Quality##
 
**Abstract**:
Many three-letter acronyms (TLAs) adorn our database world. This session focuses on two recent additions – MDS (Master Data Services) and DQS (Data Quality Services) – explaining what the new features are and exploring how to leverage them to improve your data quality. 

High data quality is fundamental to any business analytics system. In this session, we’ll begin with an overview of data quality and the latest Microsoft tools available, and then demonstrate MDS and DQS and how to use them together for continuously improving data quality. We’ll also look at how to integrate them into your existing data-quality strategies. Data quality is everyone’s responsibility – but we can still lead the way forward. Join this session to see how.

##Title: Improve the Performance of Your T-SQL by Changing Your Habits##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you dread handing your T-SQL over for code review? Do your queries run slower than you expect? Does the DBA always want to tweak your T-SQL? In this demo heavy session, we’ll take a look at various ways to improve your T-SQL. You’ll learn about formatting T-SQL for readability and why top down design is not the best solution for writing T-SQL. You’ll learn why implicit conversions slow queries down and how to leverage simple techniques for minimizing the performance impact of explicit conversions. You’ll also learn how to use set theory to improve performance. By changing some of your T-SQL writing habits you can improve performance of queries from the very beginning.

##Title: Automating SSIS Development with Biml##
 
**Abstract**:
SSIS is a great tool for transferring data from one data source to another, and for implementing complex ETL processes. However, there are some painful shortcomings that make it difficult to automate package creation, easily reuse patterns and templates, and create packages directly from schema information and other metadata.  The free and open source BIDS Helper Add-In offers support for automatically generating SSIS packages using the Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml). 
In this session we will start by showing the power of Biml.  We will then step back, and start from the beginning of using BimlScript.  Once we cover the basics, we will cover practical examples using the BIDS Helper add-in to automate SSIS development.

##Title: Mastering the CUBE Functions in Excel 2013##
 
**Abstract**:
This session explores the seven CUBE functions that are natively available in Excel 2013. Unknown to many business analysts, these useful functions can be used to retrieve data model members and values to create parameter-driven report designs.

The session topics will introduce each of the seven functions. Demonstrations will range from the simple, to the more sophisticated involving dynamic expressions, MDX expressions, integration of data from multiple data models, and macro-driven layouts.

This session is a must for those looking to drive more from Excel when reporting from the BI Semantic Model. Much of the content presented in this session is also applicable to Excel 2007 and Excel 2010.

##Title: SQL Impossible: Restoring/Undeleting a table ##
 
**Abstract**:
Yes, you read the title right. 
No, it's not about the usual "one table per partition" and "restore full backup then copy the data over" methods.
No, there are no 3rd party tools involved. Just you and your SQL Server. 

Yes, it's crazy. No, it's not for production purposes. And yes, that's why it's so much fun.
Prepare to dive into the world of data pages, log records, deletes, truncates and backups and how it all works together to get your table back from the endless void.

##Title: Attributes  Hierarchies in Analysis Services 2012##
 
**Abstract**:
The session explains Attributes and Hierarchies in Analysis Services 2012 Semantic Model. They are used to slice (filter) and dice (group) measures and dimensions used to view analytical data.  The slicing and dicing of data involves fields, columns, or whatever you want to labeled them. But, in SQL Server Semantic model these are called Attributes and Hierarchies. The configuration of these slicers and dicers are important in SQL Server Analysis Services. This session will demonstrate the difference between an attribute and columns in a hierarchy in the dimension as well as the configuration of these for best performance and viewing.

##Title: Handling Errors and Data Anomalies in SSIS##
 
**Abstract**:
Even in the most reliable ETL system, it's eventually going to happen: A package will fail, an output row count won't match what is expected, a data anomaly will force a forensic search of the package infrastructure... 

In this session, we'll talk about some of the things that can go wrong during package execution - and some of the defenses that can be built into SSIS to help head off those errors (or at least make the errors easier to troubleshoot). From error handlers to package restartability, and from logging methods to row count validation and remediation, we'll cover various ways to keep your ETL flowing when problems arise.

##Title: SQL Server Database Development with SSDT ##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Data Tools is an evolving product.  Besides revamping database projects this product has also changed the lifecycle in which we receive new features.  In this session we will demonstrate features such as database snapshots, localdb, and database unit testing.

Most importantly we’ll show the many benefits of the Publish feature, and why you will want to use the built-in refactoring instead of just renaming objects.  Throughout this presentation we will also highlight and demonstrate the features that have been added to SSDT in the past year.

##Title: “Indexing” Encrypted Data##
 
**Abstract**:
As a SQL Server DBA I see my role having 2 main focuses. First is to protect the data and second is to ensure performance is maximized. More often than not companies forget about data security when they focus on performance tuning. In this presentation I will mention a few cases where encryption could have saved a lot of hassle. I will then demo a method that can be used to "index" commonly searched on encrypted values (ex: SSNs, Credit Card, etc) helping reduce the impact on the performance of a query.

##Title: Hadoop for the Microsoft Guy##
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft have released a distribution of Hadoop targeted at making big data accessible to everyone.  Hadoop is different to SQL Server.  Not necessarily better, just different.  It is a tool for a job.  if you have only ever worked with an RDBMS such as SQL Server then Hadoop is going to play with your mind a little and you are going to need to rethink a few things.
This session is going to take Hadoop and break it apart.  I will also look at some of the tooling Hive and Pig.
Keep an open mind and let me show you that Hadoop has lots to offer.

##Title: Transitioning to a BI role##
 
**Abstract**:
Business Intelligence is an extremely hot career.  If you are a DBA or have another IT position, how can you transition to a BI role?  I will describe what exactly BI is, what encompasses the Microsoft BI stack, why it is so popular, and why a BI career pays so much. Then I will delve into the steps to take to become a BI expert and how I made the transition, going from a salaried DBA to a high-in-demand and high-income BI consultant.  If I can go from a complete unknown to building a personal brand that allowed me to present at the PASS Business Analytics conference in just two years, so can you!

##Title: Challenges to designing financial warehouses, lessons learnt##
 
**Abstract**:
In today’s rapidly changing financial world, designing robust and durable data warehouses can be a challenge that does not always stand the test of time.
In this presentation, we shall look at some of the challenges and design issues that were encountered whilst designing two custom warehouses and the steps that were required to cope with ongoing requirement changes, indecision from management, and shrinking budgets; all of which affected the progress of moving these projects from the design board to a profitable production stage.

##Title: Harvesting Web Data Using Power Query  Other Tools##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will cover the basics of using Power Query + other tools to explore XML data from the SQL Saturday website.  We will look at lesser-known features like XML feeds, harvesting data from other websites, and social media sources. We'll also use open source tools like Curl (a command line tool for downloading URLs) to augment the gathering of web data.  We'll also demonstrate importing data into SQL Server for use with other Power BI components.

##Title: SSIS 2012: More Than Just a Pretty UI##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) 2012 added rounded corners and Undo/Redo to the designer, but what else was added to make this worth the upgrade? In this session there will be as many demos of the new features as we can get through! Along with the rounded corners, you will also see the changes to deployment, SSIS catalog database, metadata/XML updates, Parameters, logging updates, Data Taps, ODBC support, script debugging, PowerShell interface and many others. If you haven't seen what has been updated in SSIS 2012, this will be the session to cover the most!

##Title: Smart Rats Leave First##
 
**Abstract**:
IT jobs are notoriously short-lived, with most only lasting a few years.  Very few people keep a single employer for their entire career.  Knowing when, why, and how to leave your job is as important a career step as finding new work.  Learn about how to use job transitions as opportunities to develop your career.
