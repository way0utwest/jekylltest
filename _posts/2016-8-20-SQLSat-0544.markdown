## Title: Bringing Balance to the SQL Server Force with Resource Governor
 
**Abstract**:
Balancing the needs of different groups of users on your servers isn't always easy. Competing workloads and business priorities can present a challenging problem to DBAs. Between maintenance, operational, and reporting queries, you can find yourself rather constrained in terms of performance.

Resource Governor is one the most underused features available to enterprise edition users of SQL Server. In this session, we delve into the basics of the Resource Governor feature in SQL Server and when, why, and how you should use it. We look at the types of issues this feature can help resolve. We delve into various components of the feature, such as a classifier function, workload groups, and resource pools and how those components change the behavior of SQL Server. We bring all this together with a sample implementation. Along the way, we look at best practices and questions to answer to ensure a successful implementation.

## Title: Using Powershell to Document SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Most DBAs use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects. Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exported because they live at the server level, above the database. Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for Disaster Recovery purposes. Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, Server Triggers and much more

## Title: Partitioning Basics: Treating Your Tables Like Legos
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have tables and indexes that have grown really large? Are you moving around a lot more data than you used to? Are your windows for jobs and maintenance getting tighter? If you answered yes to any of these questions, partitioning may be for you!

With partitioning, you can break a table or index down into smaller more manageable chunks. It can help you perform maintenance on just part of a table or index. You can even move data in and out of tables with quick and easy metadata only operations. We’ll go over basic partitioning concepts such as horizontal vs. vertical partitioning, and techniques like partitioned views and full blown table partitioning. We’ll  also look at how partitioning affects things under the hood. Finally you'll see some cool demos/tricks around index maintenance and data movement. At the end of this session you’ll have a firm understanding of how partitioning works and know how to make decisions on how and when to implement.

## Title: SQL Server 2016 In-Memory OLTP for DBAs
 
**Abstract**:
 In-Memory OLTP in SQL Server 2016 has been reborn. Many limitations within the previous versions have been removed, making it a viable option for a variety of workloads. As DBAs responsible for ensuring data integrity, recoverability and performance of the databases under our care, we need to know how In-Memory tables impact our jobs and our environment.  

In this session we will highlight critical issues in implementing and managing SQL Server 2016 instances and databases containing In-Memory tables. The bulk of this session will be spent walking through the process of identifying candidate In-Memory tables, migrating an on-disk table to an in-memory table and comparing performance.

## Title: A SQL Developer’s Guide to MDX Basics
 
**Abstract**:
MDX is an industry standard query language for OLAP systems and is used to query Microsoft Analysis Services (SSAS). Custom MDX queries can be authored in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), in Reporting Services, Power BI and custom applications. While SQL and MDX share some common keywords, they have very different syntax and concepts. This session is for anyone familiar with SQL concepts who wants to get started with MDX.

In this session we will first explore data organization in SSAS in multidimensional mode using AdventureWorks sample database. Then we will review a couple of MDX and SQL queries that return the same results and continue to learn MDX fundamentals by running queries in SSMS. We will see how certain queries are much easier to write in MDX, especially when it comes to querying data with hierarchies such as a date rollup. Finally, we will learn how to capture MDX queries generated by Excel and SSMS, to use as practical examples of how to write MDX queries.

## Title: Surviving Your Peak Database Load
 
**Abstract**:
Each application and system is different, but all have a similar quality: there will be times where the systems are used more, and other times where they may appear to be sleeping. Good examples are monthly, quarterly, and yearly for financial systems and the holiday season for retail. The last thing you want to have in these timeframes is your CxO standing at your desk wondering why things are slow or possibly down. Ensuring that your SQL Servers are optimally configured for those heavy usage periods cannot be done with a wing and a prayer – you need an actionable, realistic plan. This session will discuss how to guarantee that your SQL Server instances and the configurations they use are as scalable and reliable as possible.

## Title: Designing highly flexible PowerShell Scripts
 
**Abstract**:
A common practice when a script is needed for a particular task is to copy an existing script and modify it to meet a new need.  At some point, a bugs are found and fixed in the script it was found in.  After a while, there are many versions of the script, but the variations are numerous.  This session provides one method to break this cycle by creating a script that is highly flexible to the kind of variations that will exist in an environment.
