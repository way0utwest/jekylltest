## Title: Programming T-SQL Enhancements in SQL Server 2012
 
**Abstract**:
As SQL Server evolves, so does Microsoft continue to improve and enhance Transact SQL (T-SQL). In SQL Server 2012, T-SQL remains the primary language for programming the relational database engine. In this informative and demo-packed session, Lenni will guide you through the T-SQL enhancements in the very latest release of SQL Server. We’ll dive into powerful new windowing enhancements with the OVER clause, running and sliding aggregations, new T-SQL functions (all 22 of them!), improved error handling with THROW, server-side paging with OFFSET/FETCH NEXT, sequence generators, and rich metadata discovery techniques. If you want to learn the new T-SQL enhancements in SQL Server 2012, you won’t want to miss out on this session!
