##Title: Possible Musics:  Choosing between Analysis Services 2012 Multidimensional and Tabular##
 
**Abstract**:
The Analysis Services 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI.  BI professionals can implement Multidimensional cubes, or they can deploy Tabular models, developed by business users, to a dedicated server.  Those new to Tabular, or those embarking upon BI for the first time with Analysis Services 2012, may find it difficult to choose between the two paths.  In this session, BI Architect, SSAS Maestro and MVP Bill Pearson overviews the nature and design goals of each option, comparing Multidimensional and Tabular features.  He then offers guidance on selecting the appropriate model, providing real world examples to illustrate approaches for given scenarios.

##Title: Bridging the Chasm:  BI Theory vs. Practice##
 
**Abstract**:
A Dynamic Dialog session: According to research compiled by Gartner from discussions with many BI clients, a substantial disparity exists, in the implementation of BI, between theory (standard approaches, promises, claims and expectations) and practice (shortfalls, compromises and other realities). In this session, Business Intelligence Architect and Microsoft MVP Bill Pearson leads a dialog within which we gain an understanding of the general types of discrepancies between the “ideal” approach to BI and the compromised reality that a large number of organizations experience. We’ll then share and class experiences as a group, and discuss ways to avoid these discrepancies in future projects.

##Title: How To Build A SQL Server Virtual Lab On Your Own Machine##
 
**Abstract**:
As the number of SQL Server versions and features grow over time so does the difficulty in maintaining a set of tools for working with all of them on your local machine. Add in that some features require multiple physical instances and suddenly a single installation isn't enough. Need to quickly switch between versions and editions of SQL Server? Want to learn how to set up an AlwaysOn Availability Group? Or maybe you want to try out the latest features in SQL 2014...virtualization offers a convenient way to do any and all of these. In this session we'll show you how by covering the fundamentals of desktop virtualization and demonstrating how to set up a virtual lab on your own machine.

##Title: Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell##
 
**Abstract**:
Much of your ETL process flow consists of packages that are very similar in structure, capturing data from a single source and transferring that to a single destination.  Creating the individual packages can be tedious and it's easy to miss something in the process of generating the same basic package over and again.  BI Markup Language makes it easy to build new packages, and PowerShell makes creating the BIML scripts easy.  In this session we'll show you how to use PowerShell to generate dozens of SSIS packages doing similar tasks from a defined set of ETL sources.

##Title: The Modern Data Warehouse##
 
**Abstract**:
Current models of data warehousing are being challenged by data that is coming at us bigger, faster, and more variable that it ever has before. In traditional models we would throw out much of the data or aggregate to a course grain so that we could gain query performance but may loose some of the nuance needed for deep analytics. How is Microsoft bridging the GAP between the need for speed in both data ingestion and query performance? How is Microsoft integrating the worlds of relational and non-relational data? This session will discuss aspects of Microsoft's data warehouse vision ranging from traditional SMP, our MPP appliance, what we are doing in the cloud and how it all works together.

##Title: SSIS 2012 Parameters, deployments, and environments##
 
**Abstract**:
SSIS 2012 brings some paradigm shifting concepts to the table.  Configurations are being deprecated in favor of Parameters, the Project deployment model vs. the package deployment model, and the addition of environments.  This sessions will go hands on to review upgrading some packages, working in parameters and dropping your configurations, work through some of the advantages of the Project deployment model, and round it out with a discussion on Environments to help control the behavior of your packages.

##Title: Dynamic SQL: Writing Efficient Queries on the Fly##
 
**Abstract**:
Dynamic SQL can be a powerful tool that allows you to write fast  efficient queries when the specifics may not be known until run-time.  It can also be complex, difficult to read and debug, and the source of some of the most confusing TSQL you'll ever see.

Explore the many uses for dynamic SQL as well as best practices for writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining it, with the bonus of helping to improve the sanity of your coworkers (and your own) in the process!

##Title: Easy SQL Server Benchmarking##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have a new piece of hardware going into service and want to see how well it performs? Or do you have a few systems and want to see how they compare against each other? Multiple free and easy ways to stress test your SQL Servers exist by simulating an OLTP workload against a real SQL Server and the infrastructure underneath. In this session we will demonstrate how to test your storage and SQL Server instances to get raw performance numbers that you can use to compare performance of machines across your enterprise. The utilities DVDStore, HammerDB, and SQLIO will be demonstrated in depth.

##Title: Squeezing Top Performance from Your Virtualized SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
Just about anyone can click through a SQL Server installation and get it working, but more than a little  tuning is required to get the most performance out of your servers. Once virtualized, additional tuning can help get even more performance out of that virtual machine. David Klee (@kleegeek) will discuss valuable details for both VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V on how to tweak and tune your virtual infrastructure for business-critical virtualized SQL Servers. Tips on configuring your SQL Server installations for maximum performance when virtualized will be covered in detail.

##Title: Recovery that May or May Not have a Wizard##
 
**Abstract**:
The wizards that come with SQL Server help us accomplish many things including recovering the database; however, we can not use the wizards for all our data recovery issues.  In this session we'll review recovery topics of page corruption, temporary storage loss, master database recovery, and other data recovery scenarios.  We'll also determine which of these scenarios can be resolved with a wizard.

**Abstract**:
There are number of things you can do to optimize SSIS packages to improve overall performance and shorten load times.  This session will review 3 areas: common mistakes developers make, settings and tweaks, and design pattern improvements.

##Title: SQL Audit - auditing doesn't have to be boring##
 
**Abstract**:
Let's face it, auditing isn't fun. But if you're a DBA, you need to know what's going on in your SQL Server instance. Fortunately, SQL Audit makes it easy. In this session, we'll cover what you can and can't audit using SQL Audit, enhancements in 2012, configuring database and server audits, ways to process output, and ideas for how to implement SQL Audit on a larger scale. Auditing doesn't have to be hard. And with the help of a little custom coding, it can even be fun.

##Title: Manage SQLServer Efficiently w/PowerShell Remoting##
 
**Abstract**:
You have more and more servers to manage and less time to accomplish everything. You're writing scripts to automate those tasks but they still take time to run. PowerShell remoting allows you to manage servers without the overhead of Remote Desktop, and allows you to run processes on all your servers simultaneously.  In this session we'll walk through how PowerShell remoting works, how to set it up, and how you can save time getting things done more quickly.

##Title: 101 Stupid Things Your Colleagues Do When Setting Up SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
There are some things that you just wish your colleague had known before they installed an instance of SQL Server.  Next, Next, Next, Next, Done. Right? NO!!! The stink from that just doesn't go away.  In this session you'll learn which default settings can come back to haunt you as well as best-practice configurations in SQL Server, the OS, and virtualization layer to ensure stable performance.  This session is for the accidental DBA or anyone who needs to install SQL Server occasionally (or for their colleagues who need to mop up afterwards).
