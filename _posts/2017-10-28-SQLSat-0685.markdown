## Title: SSIS Package generation with BIML
 
**Abstract**:
Ever ended up with a source system where an old datatype was replaced with a new one so you had to rebuild all your SSIS packages? 
Entered a project with SSIS packages which needed a complete rebuild to perform but you didn’t have the time for a rebuild of your whole project?
Client specifications changed (again) and you had to start all over again building all your packages?

We did it all and rebuild 100+ SSIS packages within a day using biml for generating SSIS packages. 
And with a generator at hand, we were able to absorb a new version of a source system including analysis of the changes made in the source in only two days. And the best of all, BIML is part of BIDSHelper and free to use!
Don' t just believe what I say, In my session I will demonstrate where to start. 
I will show you around in BIML. After the quick basics of BIML I will show you how you can parameterize the BIML script in order to multiply the template to multiple packages over and over again.

## Title: Database Continuous Delivery on the Microsoft Platform
 
**Abstract**:
A look at the state of the art in database continuous delivery using SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT), Visual Studio Team Services(VSTS), and VSTS Release Management.

The features provided by platforms such as TFS and VSTS have been widely adopted by application developers in support of modern software development practices such as continuous delivery.

In the world of database development, adoption has been much slower, due to a number of organisational and technical considerations.

This session will discuss some of the challenges associated with database continuous delivery, and the ways in which Visual Studio, SQL Server Data Tools and Visual Studio Team Services can help to improve delivery of SQL Server databases.

## Title: SQL Server and Continuous Integration
 
**Abstract**:
It's understandable that developers love to work in separate code branches, but this can create painful complications if not managed.

Do you dread large merge conflicts when integrating code?
Continuous Integration is method of working where we merge and fully test our code multiple times a day. This is only possible with a high level of automation. 

I'll be discussing the tools I use to achieve this automation when developing SQL Server databases.

Finding automating the deployment of database changes hard?
ReadyRoll is a tool that allows you to test deployments during development.

How do you know your database change won’t affect something you haven’t thought of?
tSQLt and Pester unit tests can put your mind at rest.

Having trouble keeping your test environments in sync with production?
Docker enables us to fix this with infrastructure as code

You will see how a CI approach to database development can increase team efficiency and reduce the time to go from an ide

## Title: Deep dive into Query Store on SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
Query Store is a new feature that got released on SQL Server 2016 version and is being improved over the last cumulative updates and on SQL Server 2017 vNext CTP's versions. It's a very useful and interesting feature that allow DBA's ( and non-DBA's :) ) to easily identify performance issues on queries and also allow us to fix it in a fast and simple way. Just the ability to compare a previous execution plan to a new plan is a huge step towards understanding what may be happening in our instance. We can even tell the optimizer which plan we want it to use. These were all either extremely difficult to do before and in some cases impossible to do. I want with this session to give you the insight and knowledge to get started using this new and wonderful feature that will change the way how you do performance tuning.

## Title: Patterns for building hybrid scenarios with SQL Server and Azure
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server and Azure are built for each other. New hybrid scenarios between on-premise SQL Server and Azure mean they don't have to exclude each other but instead you can have the best of both worlds. 

For example, by taking advantage of services like Azure Blob Storage or Azure VMs we can increase the availability of our services or distribute data in smart ways that benefit our performance and decrease cost. In this demo-heavy session, you will learn the strongest use cases for hybrid scenarios between on-premises and the cloud, and open a new horizon of what you can do with your SQL Server infrastructure. SQL Server and Azure are built for each other. 

New hybrid scenarios between on-premise SQL Server and Azure mean they don't have to exclude each other but instead you can have the best of both worlds.

## Title: SQL Server on Linux and high availability
 
**Abstract**:
Open source is part of the Microsoft strategy. Indeed, you may run SQL Server either on a physical or a virtual machine, and recently on the top of Windows or Linux operation system as well.

At the same time, maintaining business continuity service remains a major challenge for customers because it is synonymous with economic competitivity.
Fortunately, high availability features for Linux will also be shipped with SQL Server 2017 to address this daily concern. 

This session will be delivering an overview of what is new and how it is going to change the landscape of your mission-critical scenarios.

## Title: R Server on Spark - Go big or go home
 
**Abstract**:
The publication of R Server by Microsoft aims to improve the weaknesses of the R language and its processes of performance, development and operationalization. When we need to analyze very diverse or really large amounts of data, traditional servers may fall short, and this is where R Server over Spark comes to the rescue. How is it implemented in the Microsoft ecosystem? In what scenarios does it help us? How do we configure it? In this session we will answer all these questions and more, with our eyes always on the clouds and thinking big.
