## Title: Cube Monitoring  Load Balancing in MS-Adcenter 
 
**Abstract**:
The session is mainly a review of Cube Health Monitoring and Load Balancing in adCenter Enterprise Cube Environment.  It is a detailed discussion and review of our process on achieving the following goals:
1.	Create a load balancer across the OLAP cubes
2.	Achieve better monitoring and alerting of our enterprise OLAP systems
3.	Increase our Up-time and monitor our SLA
4.	Increase our ROI of the HW
Currently AdCenter has two major services that are integrated / connected to each other: first one does the monitoring and alerting of the OLAP cubes and the second one does load balancing across the OLAP servers. The monitoring service notifies the load balancer when a server is not available so the cube balancer does not route traffic to it

## Title: You’re My Density: Making Sense of Statistics
 
**Abstract**:
The Query Optimizer uses statistics to decide how to execute a query.  If statistics are out of date, improperly sampled or simply don’t exist, then you could unintentionally deceive the Optimizer. Accurate statistics can help avoid poor query plans, so if you’re not familiar with how to read a histogram, the various options for updating statistics or want to know why sample size does matter, this session is for you! We will also delve into what happens when a value doesn’t exist in a statistic, discuss methods to manage statistics for volatile tables and examine the challenges that exist with statistics on partitioned tables. Expect a session filled with demos and real-world examples that will create a foundation of statistics knowledge.

## Title: Devs are from Mars, Report Servers are from Venus
 
**Abstract**:
Do you remember what it was like to fall in love? Wasn't it wonderful? Lately it just hasn't been the same. You've been stuck in the same old routine, doing the same old charts and tables. Maybe Reporting Services doesn’t tell you what’s wrong. Maybe you're even thinking about seeing other reporting products (!) In this session made for report developers with less than 2 years' experience, Doug will re-ignite your passion for RS by showing you how to design for better performance, explaining what RS has been trying to tell you through logs (but you haven't been listening), and demonstrating some new -- and easy -- tricks you may not have known RS can do. After this session, you'll want to spend some time alone with your new old flame.

## Title: So you've built a cube...Now what?  MDX essentials
 
**Abstract**:
MDX is an elegant and powerful query language for SQL Server Analysis Services but it's not easy for most to figure out, unguided.  This session is led by Microsoft BI Architect, author and SQL Server MVP, Paul Turley.  We will start with a review of the basic of concepts of cubes, dimensions and hierarchies.  From the ground up, you will learn how to use MDX query constructs to report business analytical data to your users with measures, calculated members, KPIs, slicers.  You'll learn to use some of the most useful MDX functions so you can take what you learn and put it to practical use next Monday morning.

## Title: The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects
 
**Abstract**:
Taking the periodic table of elements into consideration I've created The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects as a reference tool for these functions and views that have become so critical for today's SQL Server DBA to performance tune and gain metadata insights into their various SQL instances. In navigating the table we will examine key DMVs and DMFs of interest: requests, sessions, wait stats, indexes, system information will all be covered. We will also delve into how these DMOs - just like their elemental counterparts - can be combined to yeild interesting insights into your servers. We will also look at how things can go awry as well! Like mixing vinegar and baking soda, sometimes combining DMOs can cause a big mess too!

## Title: Analyze and map spatial data with SQL Server 2008
 
**Abstract**:
With the widespread availability of location and spatial data to both consumers and corporations
(such as smartphone GPS data), there is a need to manage and analyze all this data as well.
SQL Server 2008 introduces new standards-based spatial data types and associated functionality
to the relational engine. Spatial data can be stored in the cloud using SQL Azure.
And SQL Server 2008 R2 Reporting Services allows spatial data to be visualized as Maps.

In this session, we'll explore both the SQL spatial data types and SSRS maps,
using demos to show this functionality in action. We'll also cover enhancements to 
spatial functionality in the forthcoming "Denali" version of SQL Server.

## Title: Working with Server Side Traces
 
**Abstract**:
You may have heard that it’s a good idea to use a server-side trace to capture SQL profiler data, but do you know how to create one? And, do you know how to process the data you’ve captured?  If not, then this session is for you.

First, we’ll examine the anatomy of a server-side trace script and look at the different ways it can be customized. Then, we’ll talk about methods for stopping and starting the trace, how to know what traces are already running, and ways to schedule a trace to start under certain server conditions. Last, we’ll look at different tools available to you for analyzing the data you’ve gathered, including the SQL Server Profiler client application, “home-grown” T-SQL queries, ClearTrace, and the ReadTrace.

## Title: Let Service Broker Help You Scale Your Application
 
**Abstract**:
How your business applications interact with the corporate database directly can have a dramatic impact on how successful you are, and one of the biggest issues is performance with large databases.  By designing the application to use asynchronous messaging for non-critical updates you can focus performance concerns to where the timeliness is critical.  SQL Server Service Broker handles the asynchronous requests quickly and efficiently, and minimizes the conflicts with your critical updates.  This session will walk you through the steps to get Service Broker up and running and providing a consistent delivery of your business data.
