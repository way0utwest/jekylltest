##Title: Designing High Availability Database Systems using AlwaysOn Availability Groups##
 
**Abstract**:
Are you looking for a high availability solution for your business critical application? You're heard about AlwaysOn Availability Groups and they seem like a good solution, but you don't know where to start. It all starts with a solid design. In this session we introduce the core concepts needed to design a Availability Group based system. Covering topics such as recovery objectives, replica placement, failover requirements, synchronization models, quorum, backup and recovery and monitoring. This session is modeled after real world client engagements conducted by Centino Systems that have lead to many successful Availability Groups based systems supporting tier 1 business critical applications.

##Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source##
 
**Abstract**:
Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. quot;Virtualize Firstquot; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too quot;criticalquot; to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments. Got an SQL virtualization or performance question? Bring i

##Title: Hybrid Data and Analytics via a SQL Server 2017  Azure Drone##
 
**Abstract**:
Hybrid Data and Analytics via a SQL Server 2017  Azure-Controlled Drone

Using SQL Server 2017, we will control a drone via NodeJS.  With the help of Python and ML we will then make the drone fly in the "Safe Zone". 

Join me in a presentation on how to create your Azure environment for data and analytics using the first ever drone controlled by SQL Server 2017. 

- creating a template to make proofs of concept possible
- real world situations and lessons learned in Azure
- consumption of that data through Power BI

This presentation will include creation of a hybrid solution for operational analytics both on-prem and cloud using Azure SQL Database in-memory and temporal tables to create the ultimate data and analytics experience.

##Title: Inside the SQLPS PowerShell Module##
 
**Abstract**:
SQLPS has been evolving since 2012 and the SQL Provider/cmdlets have been around since 2008. Have you taken advantage of the PowerShell infrastructure that is on your servers? This session takes you behind the scenes of the SQLPS and the new SqlServer module that is installed with the tools. We will cover how to get it without the tools, how to use it once you have it and why you will want to use it for simple tasks or complex ones. When you learn how to navigate SQL Server and all its services using Paths, you won't go back. Join me for a fun filled hour and learn how to keep SQLPS from becoming frustrating and a black box. You will be glad you did. Let's continue the journey to becoming a PowerShell DBA.

##Title: A DBAs guide to the proper handling of corruption##
 
**Abstract**:
Corruption can strike at any time. As DBAs how we alert, investigate, and respond can have profound impact on our company. In this session we will learn how to detect and respond to various types of corruption.
First we will be focus on ways to detect corruption early. This will include understanding tools available to us like DBCC CheckDB as well as the importance of testing your backups. We’ll look at some sample scripts to automate corruption checks and common alerts we should have set up on our instances.

Then we will move onto how to respond to some common example of corruption through live demos.  We’ll look at how we can analyze the situation safely as well as point out various pitfalls that trip people up. We’ll also discuss when and how we may be able to fix corruption vs restoring the database.

##Title: Treating Tables Like Legos: Table Partitioning Basics##
 
**Abstract**:
Have your tables and indexes that have grown rather large? Are they taking longer to query? Are your windows for maintenance getting tighter? If you answered yes to any of these questions, table partitioning may be for you!
With table partitioning, you can break a table or index down into smaller more manageable chunks. It can help you perform maintenance on just part of a table or index. You can even move data in and out of tables with quick and easy metadata only operations. We’ll go over basic partitioning concepts such as horizontal vs. vertical partitioning, and techniques like partitioned views and sliding windows. You'll see how we can make our index and statistics maintenance easier. At the end of this session you’ll have a firm understanding of how partitioning works and be able to make decisions on how and when to implement.

##Title: Dive into the Query Optimizer - Undocumented Insight##
 
**Abstract**:
This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.

##Title: A Masters Passport to Extended Events##
 
**Abstract**:
"As is commonly the case, all good things come to an end.  And now is as good a time as any for the use of SQL Trace and Profiler to come to an end.  Let’s face it, Trace was a good tool and had some wonderful uses.  Profiler for that matter was a good tool and was useful at times.
It is time to let those old tools retire gracefully and move into the world of XE.  This full day workshop will provide you the means to let Profiler and Trace be retired from your toolset as you discover all that XE has to offer.

This full day session on Extended Events will help prepare you to put this tool to immediate use as you walk back to your daily duties.  This workshop will teach you about Extended Events starting with the basics and moving through how to create XE sessions that will get the right data for you, while doing so with minimal impact.

You will be exposed to advanced troubleshooting techniques as we work through complex issues that are made easier through the use of XE.  Take advantage

##Title: SQL Server on Containers – Part 2##
 
**Abstract**:
Please attend Part 1 before to get full usage of this session 

Those of you remember physical server consolidation phase started with VM, and struggle to run SQL server on VM with predictable performance…. Since than this is biggest change in the way SQL will be installed. Windows 16 introduced containers support, headless NANO servers and SQL server 2017 with complete support for creating containers using Dockers, a defacto industry standard API for container packaging is to allow running SQL Server as micro-services. No matter you want to deploy SQL server on Linux or windows containers are the way…
 
Will show you how can you install 5 SQL server implementations in 5 minute with each dedicated SQL implementation taking 15 GB of space. Will show you how containerization solves the “dependency hell” problem by incorporating software dependencies into a container image and provide smooth application deployment…

This session is designed for seasoned SQL Server DBA  Developers

##Title: Bare Naked Skinny on SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
Ever feel like there are just too many layers with SQL Server? You peel off a layer and behold there is yet another layer. SQL Server is rather complex. The complexities can be rather frustrating from time to time. 

Join this NSFW (not safe for whining) session as we strip SQL down to the bare bones. I will help you undress the complexities of a few of the basic SQL Server concepts. These concepts will include locks, principals, query directives and deadlocks.

In this session I will disrobe misunderstandings related to the aforementioned topics. I will show the different types of principals in SQL Server. I will also show various scenarios involving locks and deadlocks along with some of their effects with and without query directives. The goal is to better understand these topics and to hopefully stop using and perpetuating common mis-uses of terminology and common misconceptions about the technology.

##Title: Intro to Azure from a DBA's Perspective: How to Cover Your a.a.s.##
 
**Abstract**:
Head in the "cloud"? Looking for a "cloud" with a silver lining? There are many clichés that can be used when talking about "cloud" technology but really, how does Microsoft's "cloud" offering, called Azure, actually work? Let's take a look at some basics and maybe even take a dive into the deep end. We'll look at terminology ("subscriptions", "Infrastructure as a service", "resource manager" etc.), how to create various resources (virtual machines, databases, virtual networks etc.) and maybe even log into a "cloud" database. I'll present a solid foundation that will enable you to get comfortable with the technology and allow you to expand your "cloud" skills.

##Title: Why Should I Care About ... Partitioned Views?##
 
**Abstract**:
Partitioned tables are awesome and partitioned views are dead, right? Well, sure partitioned views are not sexy but there are still plenty of applications where they are critical. And not necessarily just for standard edition who aren't on the new service pack yet. If your data is time stamped, do you see different queries run against older data than new data? Do you with you could segment your data across multiple columns? Do you have data you need to partition horizontally? It's possible partitioned views may still be for you. Come hear why this is still an important topic long after cargo pants and trucker hats went away ... and possibly even after 2016 SP1.

##Title: Dive into Azure Data Lake##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, we'll show the power of this Azure MPP solution.  T-SQL is a great data language that makes parallelism easy.  C# is a fantastic statically typed language that taps into the power of the .NET framework, but parallelism has a big barrier to entry.  Learn how U-SQL combines the best of both worlds to clean and analyze data at incredible levels.  Azure Data Lake Analytics makes Hadoop affordable and easy by leveraging your existing knowledge of T-SQL and C#.

##Title: Where did I put my (primary) keys?##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will revisit some of the fundamental design principals of relational databases: normalization rules, key selection, and the controversies associated with these issues from a practical perspective.
We will consider the benefits and challenges of using different types of keys - natural, surrogates, artificial (and others?) from multiple aspects: data consistency, application development, maintenance, portability and performance.

##Title: SQL Server Containers and Clones##
 
**Abstract**:
“Containers and Clones for SQL Server Development and Test”
 
Microsoft is emphasizing the use of containers for development and test on SQL Server 2017, and new solutions from Red Gate and Windocks add support for containers and SQL Server database fast cloning,  for the full range of the SQL Server family.   We’ll explore use of Docker based tooling for delivery of container environments, and their pros and cons.     We’ll also look at SQL Server cloning, and how clones enable Dev and Test teams to work on large database environments for containers as well as existing SQL Server instances.

##Title: A Survey of the Azure Data Platform##
 
**Abstract**:
Choosing where to store your data is far more difficult than ever. We can be paralyzed with choice! This session seeks to ease that anxiety and provide direction for application developers and DBAs. You'll learn the differences between DocumentDB, Azure Table Storage, Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL in a VM, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, Azure Data Lake Analytics, Azure Data Lake Store, and more. See demos and review case studies so you'll have a complete view of how data is stored in Azure and how to choose between these great tools.

##Title: Welcome To the 2016 Query Store!##
 
**Abstract**:
One of my favorite new features in SQL Server 2016 is the Query Store. The Query Store houses valuable information on performance of your queries as well as gives you great insights into your query workload. This presentation will take a look at the Query Store, how it works and the type of information it holds. You will learn how to use the Query Store to quickly find plan changes and analyze performance issues caused by them.  New DMVs will be introduced and the performance impact of enabling the Query Store will be discussed. Both DBAs and developers can increase their performance tuning skills by attending this session.

##Title: SSIS Process Automation Design for the T-SQL Developer##
 
**Abstract**:
This session is geared towards T-SQL developers who are interested in ETL framework or process automation. In this session we will go over how to create a single SSIS package that can be used for process flow automation without the need to constantly update the SSIS package whenever there is a change. When something happens, something or multiple things need to happen. The architecture that will be presented is powered by tables, stored procedures and recursive CTEs.

##Title: Linux OS Fundamentals for the SQL Admin##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server and PowerShell are now available on Linux and management wants you to leverage this shift in technology to more effectively manage your systems, but you’re a Windows admin!  Don’t fear! It’s just an operating system! It has all the same components Windows has and in this session we’ll show you that. We will look at the Linux operating system architecture and show you how to interact with and manage Linux system. By the end of this session you’ll be ready to go back to the office and get started working with Linux with a fundamental understanding of how it works.

##Title: Managing Availability Groups with PowerShell##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Always On Availability Groups are all the craze. When you have a need to failover or modify a configuration there are some things that you can only do with PowerShell. Aside from these items, PowerShell can completely manage an AG. Join me for a demo filled session where we will create an Always On Availability Group from scratch to management with PowerShell, including the Windows Server Failover Cluster. From changing parameters to failover, we will have a blast using PowerShell with ease of use to make your life better. Let’s work smarter and not harder when managing this great feature of SQL Server.

##Title: DBA Cheat Sheet##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have trouble remembering common administrative T-SQL commands? Remember when you created a cheat sheet in school to help you study for an exam?  Use that same principle with the DBA Cheat Sheet! The DBA Cheat Sheet is a document filled with some basic administrative TSQL commands you’ll need in your daily work. During the session I’ll show you a few SSMS tricks and review some of the topics in the DBA Cheat Sheet document.  You’ll leave the session with a document that you can use as a reference every day.  This is geared for developers or Junior DBAs.

##Title: Weird Stuff I Saw While ... Working With Heaps##
 
**Abstract**:
We've all been told at some point that heaps are usually bad for select, update, and delete performance. But how bad are they really? Can they also be problematic for inserts? Are they ever a good idea? For this installment of Rick's "Weird Stuff" series we will take a closer look at why heaps can cause issues and maybe see a deadlock or two.

Rick is a Microsoft Certified Master with more than 20 years of SQL Server experience in a variety of roles. He currently lives in Washington state and works as an independent consultant providing remote performance DBA and performance tuning services for clients in the USA and Canada. His first exposure to SQL Server was as a database developer, but over time he became more and more interested in how the database engine operated... eventually specializing more on performance issues than code.

Rick will work with all things relational, but most enjoys helping smaller companies get better performance from MSSQL, as well as smoothing over relationships between DBA and development teams.
