##Title: What's New in SQL Server 2019: 100% Demos##
 
**Abstract**:
You haven't installed SQL Server 2019 yet, and you don't want to sit through a bunch of slides. You want to see a series of real-world demos focusing on the features of SQL Server 2019 that will make your users happier with as little work as possible on your part. You don't have time to rewrite all your queries or learn new languages - you just want the database to go faster.

I'm Brent Ozar, and I'll give you the whirlwind tour. I'll focus on just the features that make the biggest bang for the buck, things you can implement right away and see a noticeable difference. I'll show you what kinds of code will benefit the most so you can go back to the office and have an honest discussion with management about what to expect.

No slides here - not even an about-me slide. Let's dive into some queries!

##Title: Power BI Dataflows? Why you need to implement it!##
 
**Abstract**:
Not so long ago, Power BI Dataflows have been added to the Power BI landscape. It is showing great promise, as they have the potential of becoming key in every (large) implementation of a Power BI or Hybrid BI Architecture.

During this session, the core concepts of Power BI Dataflows will be explained, and we'll discuss how Power BI Dataflows could alleviate some of the specific problems you might be experiencing in your current architecture.

How this feature ties into some other cool concepts, like Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 or the Common Data Model, obviously can't be missing from this speech.

Expect to walk out of this session with a decent grasp on the underlying architecture, and some key takeaways to take home with you.

##Title: Checking in with Power Apps, Flow and Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will create an Power App that will allow users to check-in their location. We will then create a Flow that will take that location and write to a Power BI data source and refresh it. We will then create a Power BI report that will display the data on a map.

Power Apps is a great tool that allows you to create a desktop or mobile app with minimal coding. The app we are creating in this session uses the Bing location services to get the users location when a button is pressed. The Power Automate flow we create in this session will take the location and user information and write it to an Excel file. We will also look at the Power BI connector in Power Automate that will allow us to refresh a Power BI data set. In the Power BI report we will create, we will connect to an Excel file with the location information in it and display it in a report including the location on a map.

The audience will take away useful information about Power Apps, Flow and Power BI including

##Title: My romantic relation with Powershell generally and  DBATools especially##
 
**Abstract**:
I was very late to adopt Powershell in my day-to-day work as a DBA. I did some copy/change "programming" with Powershell. But it wasn't until I got in touch with DBATools that I really understood the power of Powershell.
In this session, I will demo some of the reasons I really love Powershell and DBATools.
I will cover a brief overview of DBATools and then jump into some scenarios where DBATools really helped me, including:
- Automatic restore testing
- Homecooked log shipping
- Migration work
