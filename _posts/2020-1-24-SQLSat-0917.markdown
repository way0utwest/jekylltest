## Title: Bringing AI to the edge: On-premise Azure Cognitive Services using containers
 
**Abstract**:
Azure Cognitive Services allow developers to build powerful AI-based solutions, enabling different capabilities in our software: vision. speech, search, text analytics, language understanding, and much more. Basically, the model is already built by Microsoft, you just need to do an API call to the Azure cloud and the service retrieves a result. For instance, you send a message and the Text Analytics API returns its sentiment score.

However, there might be cases in which our customers need a local, non-cloud AI solution (either because of limited Internet access or data compliance). This is now possible thanks to the latest update of Azure Cognitive Services, which offers containerization support. Using containers, we can still deliver ML-driven solutions while keeping the data in-house.

In this talk, we'll explore what it takes to configure and use containers in Azure Cognitive Services. Demos will be showcased as well for local Face and Text Cognitive Services.

## Title: Common Data Model - Our new buddy for Data Governance
 
**Abstract**:
Common Data Model as the foundation of Power BI Dataflows and as part of the Open Data Initiative with SAP and Adobe, seems to be a pretty good move from Microsoft. We want to take a closer look to this approach. In this session we show how the Common Data Model will allow you to combine Self-Service ETL and Corporate Data Engineering. We will show you how Power BI and more specialised tools like ADF, DataBricks etc. can work together on the Azure Data Lake with one common model. We than extend this and show, what opportunities this standard brings to you, when we unleash the possibilities you have on managing Data Quality and Governance. We also will have a look in how you integrate CDM in a DataOps  Methodology.

## Title: 2 Fast 2 Furious - designing for speed, concurrency, and correctness
 
**Abstract**:
With the multitude of isolation levels, concurrency models, and specialist technologies available in SQL Server, it is no surprise that transaction throughput and correctness can be directly correlated to the ability and knowledge of the person that wrote the code.

In this session, we will reveal how SQL Server concurrency and correctness often goes wrong, how we can avoid this, and how we can use our knowledge to design and develop for optimal server throughput for our applications and processes using tips and tricks gained from real-world scenarios.

We will cover SQL Server’s traditional locking model, In-Memory OLTP, Columnstore, Delayed Durability, and many other technologies and techniques you can use to make your transactions more robust.

## Title: Reporting for Developers
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI and Reporting Services can both be addressed with different programming languages, but have fundamentally different developer stories.
SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) is fully integrated with Visual Studio to provide a comprehensive development environment and full support for Application LIfecycle Management. SSRS also provides a good API for automatic generation of mass reports. Power BI has more strengths in the management area, but offers fewer possibilities in the programmatic development of reports. Power BI in the embedded flavor offers previously unavailable functions in the integration of a comprehensive reporting platform into own applications.

In this session, we will take a detailed look at the possibilities offered by the different platforms. We show when and where each platform can best be used, whether on-premises or in the cloud. Using many examples and demos, we show which functions the individual platforms offer and which challenges await the developer.

## Title: Data Science in Power BI Desktop
 
**Abstract**:
Two of the most popular modern topics are data science and Power BI. The nice thing is that you can easily combine both of them by including data science analyses in Power BI. You can do this in numerous ways. Many Power BI visualizations already include the Analytics tab with plethora of intermediate-level analytical functions available. For example, you can add a trend line and many other lines to the Scatter chart. You can use R and / or Python script sources. You can do the whole analysis in R or Python, and then visualize the results in Power BI. You can also use the good old SSAS Multidimensional Data Mining as the source. You can include Azure ML predictions in a Power BI model. With R and Python visuals, you can add the impressive visualizations from these two languages in a Power BI report and dashboard. You can also use R and Python in Power Query for advanced data manipulation. There are also many custom visuals that include data science analyses. This session introduces all

## Title: Building a modern data warehouse and BI solution in Microsoft cloud
 
**Abstract**:
Data warehouse and BI market is evolving rapidly with the appearance of new cloud born technologies. We might assume, that moving an existing Microsoft based DWH to the cloud is an easy step, but when we dig a little bit deeper, we will see, there are many-many new technological choices and aspects on how to modernize an existing dwh/bi system in the cloud. Not to mention if we start everything from scratch in a new project designed specifically to the cloud to utilize cloud flexibility and innovation as much as possible. 
Which ETL tool should I use? Data factory v2 with SSIS and BIML, or Azure Databricks powered Dataflows? Or Power BI Dataflow? Which is the right decision to run OLAP workloads? Azure AS? Or simply Power BI? When do I need Azure SQL DWH?
In the last couple years I helped many customers to modernize their DWH landscape partially or fully in the cloud and during my presentation I will share my findings and recipes for the most common situation I met. You will have fun:)

## Title: The Battle of DBAAS – RDS vs Cloud SQL vs SQL Azure
 
**Abstract**:
The public cloud is making a huge impact on the way enterprises host, manage, and scale their database operations. They can provision new infrastructure at the click of a button, without a lengthy hardware procurement process. Through a range of Database as a Service (DBaaS) options, public cloud vendors now make it easier than ever for organizations to migrate and maintain their databases. But while these solutions address many of the headaches involved in database management such as migration, provisioning, and administration, there are significant differences between the various DBaaS offerings on the market. In this session, we explore these DBaaS solutions provided by the leading cloud platforms, AWS, GCP, and Azure, and compare key features such as the types of the Database Engines on offer, Infrastructure Design Challenges, DR and HA capabilities, Performance Indicators, Pricing and Database Security.

## Title: DevOps in der Datenbank-Anwendungsentwicklung
 
**Abstract**:
In der Anwendungsentwicklung haben sich agile Entwicklungsmethoden wie DevOps, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery und Continuous Deployment mittlerweile weitgehend durchgesetzt. Dies hat zur Folge, dass entsprechende Mechanismen und Werkzeuge auch für die Datenbank benötigt werden. In vielen Unternehmen ist die Datenbank zu einem Flaschenhals in dem sonst agilen Entwicklungsprozess geworden. Datenbankspezialisten befinden sich unter stets wachsendem Druck, die Entwicklungszyklen zu verkürzen. In einer Datenbankumgebung, die sich ständig verändert und in der auch kurze Ausfälle sehr hohe Kosten nach sich ziehen können, ist wenig Raum für Fehler. Daher ist es umso wichtiger, agile Entwicklungsmethoden einzuführen, um einerseits schnellere Ergebnisse zu liefern und andererseits das Risiko zu minimieren. Dieser Vortrag befasst sich mit den Besonderheiten einer Datenbankumgebung und den daraus resultierenden Herausforderungen für die Einführung von agilen Methoden bei der Anwendung

## Title: Implementing Supertypes and Subtypes in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
A common problem in database design is the implementation of entities that are different physically (for instance, they share some attributes but have additional, specific, attributes), but should logically participate in the same relationships as one and the same.
For instance, the customer can either be a natural person (a person, for short), or a legal person (an organization or a company). The majority of the attributes of a natural person are, of course, different from the majority of the attributes of a legal person; however, from the perspective of how they participate in business operations, they need to be considered as equal.
In this session you will learn how to use specific native SQL Server functionalities to solve this particular problem: sparse columns, XML, JSON, and/or even User-defined CLR types – in an OLTP database, as well as in a star (or snowflake) schema data warehouse.

## Title: Achieving wonders with Query store
 
**Abstract**:
Query Store, a new feature released  with SQL Server 2016, can allow you to achieve wonders on the SQL Server query tunning universe: starting from ensuring that an upgrade will work and up to know exactly when a change on the database created a tunning problem, you will discover in this session how to make incredible tunning magics with query store.

## Title: Enterprise Power BI - Development Lifecycle
 
**Abstract**:
When your development team is up to a certain size and often no matter what size it is you want to start following best development practices. These include things like source control, multiple environments, deployment processes and governance.

As Power BI content is developed using Power BI Desktop and not Visual Studio as most Microsoft BI solutions are these things can get tricky. 

In this session we will look at what Power BI has to offer when it comes to development lifecycle. We will look at the different options available to the developer when it comes to source control, dev, test and production and deployment of Power BI content. We will then look at the different options when it comes to distribution of content to the end user. Lastly, we will look at governance and see how it is possible to secure the content and audit the usage of Power BI.

## Title: Azure-d Availability: SQL Server HA In and To the Cloud
 
**Abstract**:
Has your manager come to you and said "I expect the SQL Server machines to have zero downtime?" Have you been told to make your environment "Always On" without any guidance (or budget) as to how to do that or what that means? Are you facing pressure to have data in Azure as well? Help is here! This session will walk you through the high availability options in on-premises SQL Server, the high availability options in Azure SQL Database and Managed Instances, and how some or all of those can be combined to enable you to achieve the ambitious goals of your management. Beyond the academic knowledge, we'll discuss frequently seen scenarios from the field covering exactly how your on-premises environments and Azure services can work together to keep your phone quiet at night.

## Title: Designing your tabular/PowerBI model for performance and scalability
 
**Abstract**:
You developed a PowerBI or an Analysis Services Tabular model and you run it on a server with plenty of cores and memory. But your queries does not scale or your users are not happy with the performance! So what can you do? You can fine tune the settings of your AS Tabular (usually does not bring a large benefit), you can scale up (which is costly) or you can apply the techniques I am going to show you in this session. Techniques, that range from optimizing the storage of your model, to how to effectively implement DAX patterns for maximum performance. And all of that, complemented with digging into engine execution plans, DMVs, tracing activity and tabular engine internals.

## Title: Temporal tables in SQL Server: practical usage scenarios
 
**Abstract**:
Temporal tables were introduced in SQL Server 2016 as a feature for providing information about the data that was stored at any point in time, rather than just the current record. 
Using temporal tables is it possible to track all the changes occurred to the records, making it easy to "travel into the time" to figure out what has changed, when and why. 
During the session will be discussed some of the most common business scenarios for the introduction of temporal tables. 
All cases are based on real implementation to customers and on the experience gained on the field:  
- Data audit. What has changed and when.
- Point in time analysis. Check the history of changes over the time. 
- Warehouse inventory stock. Review fluctuation for product quantity. 
- Anomaly Detection. Detect anomalies and identify trends. 
- Slowly changing dimension. Query valid data for a specified period of time
- Reproduce financial reports invoices and statements.

## Title: First steps with SQL Server on Docker
 
**Abstract**:
Containers are gathering more and more attention. Wherever you take a look at - you have them. SQL Server 2019 introduces Big Data Clusters that utilise Kubernetes to orchestrate SQL Server, Spark and HDFS containers. Starting with SQL Server Express 2014 each next version of SQL Server is available as a Docker container. If your contact with containers technology was somehow limited - it's time to change that.
 
Join me in the session where I will introduce you to the containers world. You will see how easy it is to install docker, how to run the first commands to get a grip with containers. I will make some mistakes on purpose and fix the problems you may run into. After this presentation, you will be able to install docker and run the containers on your home computer.

## Title: Databricks for the SQL Developer
 
**Abstract**:
Big Data and SQL do not have a lot in common. However, over the last couple of years this changed and more and more people want to integrate the data from their Big Data systems into their SQL data warehouses. The most important technologies in the Big Data space are Spark as a technology itself and Databricks as a PaaS solution hosting it. These new tools may be frightening in the beginning but once you get to know them you will realize that they are quite similar to your regular SQL tools. And this is what this session is about - giving a regular SQL developer insights into Big Data and show how SQL can still be used to do Big Data processing with Spark and Databricks.

## Title: Power BI: From Self-Service to Enterprise
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI started out as a set of Self-Service BI tools in Excel before the merging into Power BI Desktop a couple of years ago. At the same time Power BI has evolved into a grownup scalable Enterprise BI platform. But how do you master to grow a solution from self-service to something that is scalable, managed and governed? A solution that can be trusted and used in the whole enterprise! Basically promoting a quickly made proof-of-concept project - but without redoing the whole thing.

In this demo heavy session we will take a look at the different steps you have to master, so you can make a successful ownership transfer of the different component in your Power BI solution. It be the data mashup, data modelling, report creation and report distribution. We will start with one Power BI Desktop file containing it all and end with a solution that is split up in Dataflows, Tabular model, Reports and Apps. Using the fact that Power BI eventually came out of a set of different tools and technologies. We will end up looking at different ways to certify and brand the datasets, reports and apps. So your users can distingues what is still self-service and what is enterprise.

## Title: SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters: Make SQL Server your Data Hub for everything
 
**Abstract**:
In the realm of data storage and processing, there are two major technologies which we deal with every day. On one side, we have relational data that is stored inside SQL Server, and on the other side, non-relational or very large datasets that do not fit the relational model which are stored on big data clusters like Hadoop or Spark. 
This introduces challenges when having to combine datasets across both these technologies. SQL Server was never built to process huge datasets in a distributed fashion or to handle non-relational data very well, meaning that in many cases you would have to resort to bringing your relational data into Hadoop or Spark clusters. 
SQL Server 2019 has the answer with Big Data Clusters: it combines SQL Server with HDFS and Spark!

In this session we are going to explore the capabilities of the exciting new feature. How does it work and how can we work with datasets that are non-relational?

## Title: “SQL-like” or query languages in Azure IoT
 
**Abstract**:
If you are reading Azure IoT documentation you will stumble a lot on the “SQL-like query language” or “SQL-like language” syntagms.
In this presentation we will explore Azure IoT places where queries are used and see how to use them. And in the process to find out more about this “SQL-like” languages and how being a DB developer cam make you a IoT hero.
We will concentrate on the scenarios with the greatest impact, where a little SQL can solve you a lot of hassle.
So, we will leave no SQL query unturned  in Azure IoT Hub, Stream Analytics, Power Bi to name a few.

## Title: Continuous Intelligence... What's This All About?
 
**Abstract**:
Continuous Intelligence combines the terms of Continuous Integration and Business Intelligence and aims at defining and implementing processes to keep your implementation and deployment processes for your BI applications flexible and as seamless as possible.
Even in the near past, support for CI processes of BI projects was almost not there. But, the last few years brought some changes to the perception of this topic and shifted the mindset.
Let's look at advantages and challenges for CI in BI and at possibilities to implement such a process for Analysis Services.

## Title: Datacenter and/or Cloud - When to Use One, the Other, or Both
 
**Abstract**:
As with all other items in your toolbox the datacenter (local or in the cloud) needs to be used correctly. 

This session will show the various types and sizes of workloads, show you how to categorize them, look at the requirements of your SLA (Service Level Agreement), and find the right location (cloud, datacenter, hybrid) for the data. To wrap things up, we look at ways to validate that the SLA can be fulfilled and how to estimate and compare the costs.

## Title: From adaptive to intelligent: query processing in SQL 2019
 
**Abstract**:
As announced in September 2018, SQL Server 2019 expands the "adaptive query processing" features of SQL 2017 and relabels them as "intelligent query processing". This name now covers many features, such as batch mode on rowstore, memory grant feedback, interleaved execution, adaptive joins, deferred compilation, and approximate query processing.

In this high-paced session, we will look at all these features and cover some use cases where they might help - or hurt! - you.

## Title: Statistics, an unreliable friend.
 
**Abstract**:
You learned that your statistics should be regularly updated. You even implemented Ola Hallengren's maintenance scripts. That should be enough, right? What if it's not?
Join me on some head-ache, a dive into statistics histograms, fun with flags and a praise to the evolution of SQL Server optimizer.
Much of this session is about the "ascending key problem", and how Microsoft have made shanges to the SQL Server optimizer to improve, but not completely eliminate the problem.

## Title: Monitoring SQL Server without breaking the bank
 
**Abstract**:
Monitoring SQL Server can become a very expensive business. Sure, the market offers countless paid solutions, but what if you have a large server estate and your budget is tight? 
In this session we will combine multiple open source tools (InfluxDB, Telegraf , Grafana, DbaTools and many more) to collect important performance metrics, analyze the data they collect, set up alert for the critical events, troubleshoot issues and plan for the future. Join me and you will see how monitoring is not a business for billionaires.

## Title: Real Time Autonomous Driving Data in Azure Databricks
 
**Abstract**:
Streaming and real-time data analysis are of great importance in many areas of industry. The simpler and more regular data can be analyzed by machines, the easier it is to identify problems or develop predictive models. This session uses Microsoft AirSim data, which is based on the Unreal Engine Simulator for autonomous vehicles. The AirSim data is sent in real time to a message broker (Azure Event Hub) and then processed using a fully managed Spark engine (Azure Databricks). Once Spark Streaming has processed the data, it can be accumulated and further analyzed.

## Title: Automation for the DBA: Embrace your inner sloth
 
**Abstract**:
DBAs and sysadmins never have time for the fun stuff. We are always restoring a DB for a dev or setting up a new instance for that new BI project. What if I told you that you can make all that time consuming busy-work disappear?

In this session we will learn to embrace the power of automation to allow us to sit back and relax..... or rather focus on the real work of designing better, faster systems instead of fighting for short time slots when we can do actual work.

Along the way we will see that we can benefit from the wide world of automation expertise already available to us and avoid re-inventing the wheel, again!

## Title: Automated Machine Learning – brauchen wir noch Data Scientists?
 
**Abstract**:
Was können wir hier automatisieren, brauchen wir noch einen Data Scientist und was ist unsere (ich bin ja auch so einer) Rolle in dem Szenario. Kurzer Blick über die verschiedenen Bibliotheken (H2O, auto_ml, Azure AutoML). 

Warum und wie funktioniert das (aus einer hohen Flughöhe)? Was ist der Unterschied zwischen den Realisierungen? Was macht das eigentlich genau? Blick auch auf Tools wie Power BI, Azure ML Workspace, …

Fazit: Diese Methoden stecken nun schon nicht mehr in den Kinderschuhen, Power BI und viele andere Tools verwenden es wenn sie von AI sprechen. Aber ist das AI … wir werden sehen!

## Title: SQL Server produktiv in Docker bereitstellen
 
**Abstract**:
Dass man SQL Server in Docker laufen lassen kann hat sich inzwischen sicherlich rumgesprochen. Was allerdings weniger bekannt zu sein scheint ist, dass ein SQL Server der unter Docker Desktop in einem Docker Container läuft eigentlich nur eine Entwicklungsumgebung ist und so produktiv nicht genutzt werden sollte. In seinem Vortrag geht der deutsche SQL Server MVP Frank Geisler darauf ein, wie man denn nun einen SQL Server in einem Docker Container produktiv laufen lassen kann und welche Fallstricke man dabei ggf. umschiffen muss.
