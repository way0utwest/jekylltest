## Title: Create a Data Loading Strategy
 
**Abstract**:
Loading large amounts of data into SQL Server can be challenging. Many factors may challenge your goal for tuned performance. To make the decision making process more difficult, many of the choices listed below have both Pros and Cons to their implementation. For this reason, bulk loading large amounts of data requires a strategy.

Create a strategy to optimize your massive data loading processes.
•	High Performance Data Loading
•	Minimal Logging and Bulk Loading
•	Indexing Considerations
•	Delayed Durability
•	Eager Write

This session uses a Virtual Sandbox to demonstrate “real” data loads using these techniques listed above. We will look at the T-SQL used in these data loads. We will briefly discuss how the different settings and configurations effect the data loads. Power Point slides and sample SQL will be provided.

## Title: Seamlessly Scaling Azure SQL DB with Elastic Database Tools
 
**Abstract**:
Elastic Database Tools for Azure SQL DB offers a set of features that make it easier to build and manage a scaled-out data tier for cloud applications. With elastic database tools, applications can easily access data spanning multiple DBs, coordinate management tasks and manage how data is distributed among them. As part of the session, we explore workloads that are a natural fit for Azure SQL DB's elastic database tools. Patterns discussed in depth include multi-tenant applications created by cloud ISVs and SaaS vendors, and applications relying on temporal data distribution. The session will illustrate how easy it is now to build, scale and manage cloud applications in SQL DB when using elastic tools capabilities such as the elastic database client library for .NET.

## Title: Polybase and Time Travel (Temporal Tables)
 
**Abstract**:
"With the release of SQL Server 2016, Microsoft has included two features that could fundamentally change the way we look at Data Warehousing.  The addition of Polybase for connecting to external data sources such as Hadoop and Azure Blob for native TSQL queries extends the reach of the DW.   The Temporal Table feature creates all kinds of possibilities for implementing Type 1 and 2 dimensions as well as time based reporting and logical data recovery.  In this session we will take an in depth lock at the features and scenarios for use.   We will also look at some actual demos of the technologies so you can get a feel for the technologies in action."

## Title: Developing R and SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
If you have heard about R and want to learn how to write it yourself and run it within SQL Server 2016 you will want to come to this session.  As Microsoft is now incorporating the R language into SQL Server 2016, the language is going to be a required skill for all data professionals in the near future.  SQL Server 2016 uses a non-open source version of R, and the benefits of using that version will be reviewed too.

Using SQL Server 2016, attendees will learn how to incorporate R in SQL Server as well write R code in Visual Studio which gets data from and runs on SQL Server.  The version of R which ships with SQL Server incorporates the ability to run with more data than can be loaded into memory, and attendees will learn the best use cases for it.   

Attendees will learn the setup requirements for running R from within SQL Server 2016, and learn how to run R code from within Server Management Studio.

## Title: A DBA's guide to whole stack performance troubleshooting
 
**Abstract**:
Performance troubleshooting is a required skill for every DBA. Knowing the deep internals of how a query functions and why SQL Server chose to run it in a certain way is important. Knowing how to design a table or configure a database to squeeze every ounce of performance is our lifeblood. 

What if I told you that you may be doing this all wrong? What if all the work and laborious effort put into design or configuration don't improve the situation because the issue was never in SQL to begin with? Truth be told, the biggest differentiator between a good DBA and a great DBA is knowing the hardware and O/S; not just SQL.

Join me as I guide you through troubleshooting SQL Server performance from tip to toe to demonstrate the common performance problems you never knew you had.

## Title: IoT – Particle Photon to Azure and PowerBI integration
 
**Abstract**:
This session is an introduction into integrating the Particle Photon Wi-Fi development kit and Microsoft Azure to analyze, collect, and provide PowerBI reports on IoT data. 

Azure Event Hubs is a highly scalable publish-subscribe event ingestor that can intake millions of events per second to process and analyze massive amounts of data. Once collected into Event Hubs the data can be transformed and stored using any real-time analytics provider or a batching/storage adapters.

The Particle Photon has a simple but very robust development environment. When combined with Microsoft Azure using webhooks it is capable of ingesting millions of events per second using a remotely programmable Particle Photon. 

For this training we will specifically look at publishing data from a Particle Photon (equipped with a Photon Weather Shield) to an Azure Event Hub. Next we will store the data using blog storage, SQL database, and data lake storage to then graphically represent the IoT data in PowerBI.

## Title: RESTful JSON API Microservices and SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Transforming your enterprise or startup using micro services that rely on SQL Server data can be a challenge.  There are so many options out there.  I will introduce how you can jump into API driven develop with lightning fast frameworks that make your job easy and simple.  Explore how we leverage Entity Framework to quick start your data models with code-first prototyping.  Then we will explore how to transition back when you're ready for deployment.  SQL Server offers native tools for JSON support in the newest 2016 release but if you don't have that luxury we'll explore legacy versions as well.  API driven development can transform your software development lifecycle so join me as we get you going in the right direction with the latest frameworks and tools.  Source code will be provided of a standard API framework with a real data model to accompany your efforts.  We will also touch on OAuth 2.0, Unit Testing, and Continuous Integration (CI) for truly streamlined SQL powered apps.

## Title: Managing MSDB
 
**Abstract**:
You put a lot of time into managing your databases, but MSDB often flies under the radar or only gets backed up. There are a ton of things that get stored in MSDB, so how are you supposed to know what all those items are? More importantly, how do you manage the data that is getting stored in there and keep it from growing out of control? We will take an in-depth look at all the SQL features that put data in MSDB and the best approach to managing that data.  You will walk away with scripts you can use to automate the grooming of MSDB.

## Title: Standardize Your Baseline
 
**Abstract**:
The concept of baselines have been around for many years, yet all too often they are not executed on a regular basis and don't contain enough information, I believe this is because most DBA's don't have a standard baseline to execute. Baselines can tell you how the server should be performing under normal workloads with the configuration that is currently in place.  

During this session we will look at the kinds of data that you should be collecting while spending the majority of our time reviewing the methods on how this data can be collected, stored, automated and reported on.

These standardized baselines will give you a head start the next time you are looking to upgrade your server to new hardware, recover a server and performance troubleshooting.

## Title: Stop Doing That! 5 Common T-SQL Anti-Patterns
 
**Abstract**:
There are several programming design patterns that work great in object oriented code but do not scale  inside SQL Server. Things like Scalar-Value functions, Unions, CTEs, and row by row processing can make for more work then you would expect.

In this session, we will focus on several anti-patterns like these and show how to rework them to improve scale in the database engine.   

By the end of the session, you will be able to quickly identify these common anti-patterns and analyze their sometimes unclear cost to the engine. Heading back to the office, you’ll be able to identify pain points in your longest running queries from a T-SQL perspective and become a code tuning rockstar!

## Title: WIT: Start 'em Young - Growing Women in IT
 
**Abstract**:
Do an internet search on "Women in Technology" and you'll find lots of articles with surveys, graphs and percentages telling you that there are not enough women in technology related fields.  They'll give you just as many reasons why girls don't start in IT or women don't stay in IT.  Is this true? As women in technology, are we wired differently? Was there some lightbulb moment that to put us on the path to innovate with code? Why are you in technology in the first place? From Grace Hopper to that 6th grade girl gaming with people around the globe - while technology has changed and is more accessible, what makes women pursue IT careers hasn't. With opportunities now spanning a wide array of fields and technologies, what does it take to inspire the young girls of today? In this session we will try to cut through a lot of the noise and get down to what drives young girls who grow to be women in technology, how we can encourage them, and not get in their way.

## Title: Objective SQL Server Performance
 
**Abstract**:
“It’s slow! FIX IT!” is not a fun way to walk into the office on a Monday morning. However, putting objective metrics to the subjectivity of ‘slow’ is as much a science as it is art. Performance engineering takes effort well before an issue arises. Collecting the right metrics, trending and comparing against an established baseline, and identifying bottlenecks are all part of the performance process. This interactive session will help the DBA fine-tune their performance tuning approach so that the foundation for long-term proactive performance review is in place. The DBA can then shift the job responsibilities from a reactive response to a more predictive and proactive role.

## Title: Know what your machines are doing besides SQL Server! WMI,WQL,CIM and PoSH
 
**Abstract**:
There's far more happening on your Windows servers than just SQL Server, and looking at ERRORLOG won't show you the whole story: other applications stealing your memory, OS issues, hardware errors, and more.  We'll start by looking at several different ways to collect Event Logs automatically.  From there we'll delve into WMI and WQL, which allow us to query servers (remotely or locally) to get information such as performance statistics, System and Event Logs, and even changes within SQL Server.

We'll finish it off with two immediately-usable implementations you can set up on Monday.
