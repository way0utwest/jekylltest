##Title: The Power of Data: The Complete Beginners Data Warehouse Kit##
 
**Abstract**:
For many of us data is scattered in many different systems.  We almost all have data that someone wants to compare or track but can't without a lot of manual manipulation.  So, how do you tie disparate systems together? With a Data Warehouse! In this presentation you will get the skills you need to start building your own. We will discuss the basics of what a Data Warehouse is, the tools needed to create, deploy and manage the Data Warehouse process, and the benefits of using the data you collect to manage operational processes and create data visualizations. After attending this session you will be able to return to your job and amaze people with your ability to show them the power of the data!

##Title: My Power BI report is slow: what should I do?##
 
**Abstract**:
You created a wonderful Power BI report, but when you open it you wait too much time. Changing a slicer selection is also slow. Where should you start analyzing the problem? What can you do to optimize performance?
This session will guide you in analyzing the possible reasons for a slow Power BI report. By using Task Manager and DAX Studio, you will be able to determine whether you should change the report layout, or if there is something in DAX formulas or in the data model that is responsible for the slow response.
At the end of this session, you will understand how to locate a performance bottleneck in a Power BI report, so you will focus your attention on the biggest issue.

##Title: Introduction to Azure AI - The Art of the possible##
 
**Abstract**:
According to the Economist magazine, data is the world’s most valuable resource.  So, it makes sense that Data Science, Azure Machine Learning, and Analytics are all becoming core pieces to the success of every business.  As data professionals, we need to know how these core pieces will affect what we do, and how we can use the Azure AI suite to help our clients.  Microsoft’s AI suite is the central hub for learning and implementing each of these core pieces.  Using an easy to follow example, I will show the flow from problem to solution.  Multiple demonstrations of the different pieces will show use cases of the AI suite.  This overview of Azure AI will use the various pieces like a puzzle which, when brought together, will form a seamless picture of the whole so that participants can see that the individual pieces were meant to work together.

##Title: Best Practices for Delivering  Sharing Content in Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI offers several ways to deliver and distribute content for internal colleagues and external users. In this session we will clarify when using the sharing functionality is appropriate, and techniques to effectively use My Workspace versus App Workspaces. We will discuss situations when a Power BI App becomes the optimal way to distribute content. We will also cover when to consider utilizing Power BI Premium, Power BI Embedded, or Power BI Report Server. You will leave this session with an understanding of options for collaboration and distribution of content in the context of personal BI, small teams, large teams, and enterprise-wide BI initiatives.

##Title: Mentoring Women in Tech:  A Guide for Men  Women Who Want to Help##
 
**Abstract**:
Women make up less than 20% of the tech world and they're leaving the field at a rate over 3 times the rate that men are.  Women cite lack of effective mentorship as one of the leading reasons for their exodus.  Whether you're a colleague, a manager or someone who wants to change the status quo, your opportunity to effectively tip the scales changes.  

What do you do for a living, what level are you at in your career and are you in any kind of management role?  Can utilizing women's groups either at work or via a professional organization work for you? In this session, we'll discuss different ways you can mentor and sponsor women in tech.  We'll provide concrete steps you can take to mentor, sponsor or just offer support. These solutions vary based on who YOU are, where you are in your career, if you have hiring/promotion influence, etc.  Learn how you can make a difference.

##Title: Taming of the Shrew - Optimizing Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
No one wants to tell a report user that while running a report in Power BI they have time to go get a cup of coffee…in another town.  Although data sets will often be the focus of performance issues, it’s important to know how to locate performance problems in Power BI and how to eliminate them.  

This session will take the Power User through how to identify time consuming processing in Power BI and how to address it through step-by-step and proven methods used to optimize in multi-tier environments.  This method removes frustration and finger-pointing and gets to the heart of the problem with a goal of correcting performance challenges.  The results are satisfied end users who get the information they need, when they need it.

Take Aways:
Learn how to identify what is taking the time in a Power BI data set and report.
Understand the logging and tracing mechanisms and capabilities in the environment.
Understand when a problem is really a problem.

##Title: Power BI Deployment Strategies:  The Business versus I.T.##
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft’s Power BI service has allowed end users and business analysts to exercise their creativity as developers.  The expansion of department resources to create elegant and visually appealing reports for themselves and their organization at a fast pace, has taken some of the burden off developers, or has it?  
Are you hoarding your environment with unorganized piles of data to feed your wonderful Power BI reports?  In this life of point and click, drag and drop reporting, we sometimes lose sight of cohesive business standards, data integration and data modeling.
In this session, we will look at potential data management concerns that include but are not limited to; overlapping data, inconsistent naming conventions, undocumented transformations, mismatch data types and varying granularity.  We will focus on the importance of having a solid data model and managing data governance using Power BI as well as traditional tools and best practices.

##Title: A Whistle stop Tour of Microsoft SQL Server and Azure BI Offerings##
 
**Abstract**:
Get ready for a wild ride as we identify  discuss the combination of Microsoft technologies which make up the “Data territory”, the offerings for BI/DW/Data Science practitioners. Some parts of the territory are ripe w/opportunity while other less-discovered parts are a bit hostile.

We’ll leave the engine running at each stop but spend enough time for the passengers to understand exactly what the various components mean. Throughout the tour, we’ll talk to the applicability of the components based on sizes of data (and customer). 

At journey’s end, the attendee will want to take action and their own path into Microsoft “Data Territory”.

Learnings:	
Attendees will have a more complete view of Microsoft’s SQL Server and Azure BI “Data Platform” offerings
Attendees can expect to be whisked into aspects of the Microsoft Offerings they may have never heard of or understood.
Attendees should be able to correlate the various Microsoft offerings to the size and scope of their own projects

##Title: Creating Near Real Time ETLs Using Serverless Architecture##
 
**Abstract**:
Demand for up to the minute data has increased as businesses leverage their reporting to make decisions based on current conditions. This requires a different type of ETL architecture that can consume individual events as they occur instead of bulk processing.

Azure offers several services to fill this need, to the point where the sheer number and variety of them can become confusing. We’ll take a look at these different options individually as well as how they can fit together to create flexible, scalable stream of data.

The focus will be on Azure’s serverless offerings, but other PaaS services will be discussed where they may interact with a serverless design.

##Title: Should This Be Normalized? When Database Normalization Seems Abnormal##
 
**Abstract**:
Ever since database normalization was introduced as a concept by Edgar Codd, there has been continuous debate on how far we should go to eliminate data redundancy. A new developer may be asking why there is a need to create multiple tables, and a DBA may be concerned that performance is being sacrificed. In this semi-interactive talk, we’ll discuss 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and Boyce-Codd Normal Forms, evaluate the pros and cons of normalization and denormalization for integrity and performance, and run through some demos involving scenarios of various data model formats. All to answer the question, "should...this...be...normalized?"

##Title: Data Quality - Plain  Simple##
 
**Abstract**:
Data quality is a subject that comes up over and over again in many organizations. Most executives are concerned about the quality of the information used in their decisions. We talk about "good data" and "bad data" but what do those terms mean? In this presentation, we will first define what data quality is and look at how to measure it with data quality dimensions. Then, we'll explore common causes for data quality issues and how to perform a data quality assessment. Finally, we'll review the results and discuss some strategies and tools that can help improve the quality of the data in your organization.

##Title: Applying Data Warehousing Principles##
 
**Abstract**:
Many data analysts typically begin to work with data as a single flat table. While this works for small datasets, as the size of the data grows these naive methods do not scale. Processing records takes longer, queries become more complex, and introducing new datasets is inconsistent at best. In order to solve these problems, we must take into account the underlying architecture of our data and how it should be modeled. During this talk we will discuss key concepts, patterns, and techniques for designing a data model that is simple to query, scales with your data, and is extendable to new datasets.

##Title: All (Data) Things Considered: The Lean Coffee Workshop##
 
**Abstract**:
Collaboration is the heart of SQLSaturday's, but too often attendees move from session to session in a passive learning mode.  This session is based on the Lean Coffee model, and is a structured workshop with no pre-planned agenda.  The goal is to involve YOU in the conversation; bring your questions, your answers, your business cards, and your desire to learn.  YOU set the agenda, YOU decide when to move on, and YOU engage and learn.

During this entirely hands-on, no-slides session, I'll walk you through the steps to implement a popular report requirement for writeback, that Power BI doesn't natively support.

##Title: Whipping Away Stress##
 
**Abstract**:
Did you know stress releases chemicals into the blood? These chemicals give more energy and strength, which can be a positive if the stress is caused by physical danger. But this can also be a negative, if the stress is in response to something emotional and there is no way to release the extra energy and strength. Need stress management techniques? Stressed out? Learn how to cope and ultimately whip stress away.

##Title: Using Your On-prem Data in a Cloud World##
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft Power BI, Flow, and PowerApps are powerful cloud tools that can take your on-premises data to new heights. Using your data where it is now gives you the ability to invest in improving processes, instead of focusing on a data migration strategy.

In this session, we will discover the benefits of using the cloud tools, how those benefits translate to being on-prem, and how we can use the data in Office 365 as well. We will setup a data gateway, connect to on-prem data sources, and use that data in Office 365 and SharePoint.
