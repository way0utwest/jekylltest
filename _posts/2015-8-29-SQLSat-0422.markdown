## Title: SQL Server for the Configuration Manager 2012 administrator
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a core dependency for all components of the System Center suite of products.  Configuration Manager 2012, a component of the suite, will be the focus of our discussion as it is more demanding that a typical SQL application.  To best support Configuration Manager 2012 administrators need to understand database structure, configurations that will allow for optimal SQL performance, the way Configuration Manager 2012 replication leverages the SQL Broker engine and more.  This session will focus on the nuggets that the Configuration Manager administrator needs to understand to make sense of the SQL backend.  Beyond the Configuration Manager 2012 administrator discussions will be interesting to anyone trying to tune SQL.

## Title: Managing Security in SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
In the world of extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), everything we do involves moving data from one point to another. However, very often the focus in SSIS package development is on functionality, not security. When building internal data transformation and movement processes, it is easy to forget that these operations broaden our security footprint, and must be actively managed to ensure that ETL doesn’t become the weak link in the security chain.
In this presentation, we’ll discuss the security features in SQL Server Integration Services, while reviewing best practices for securing your ETL infrastructure while providing enough (but not too much) access to those ETL assets. Among the topics we’ll cover:
	Properly securing connection passwords in SSIS
	Using package protection levels
	Restricting access to deployed packages
	Using role-based security for SSIS deployment and execution
	Using execution proxies

## Title: Incremental Load Design Patterns
 
**Abstract**:
The volume of data addressed by the typical ETL operation is constantly on the rise.  Not so many years ago, a table with a few million records was considered to be huge.  These days, it's not uncommon to deal with multibillion row tables.  As a result, ETL professionals are frequently tasked with finding efficient ways to incrementally process these large sets of data without resorting to expensive and time-consuming destructive reloads.
 
In this session, we will review the common decision points surrounding incrementally loading data, and will demonstrate some of the methods for incremental processing.  Among the topics of discussion:
--Deciding whether an incremental load is appropriate
--Pick your tool: T-SQL or SSIS?
--Methods for detecting new and changed records
--Common incremental load design patterns

## Title: SS2014 In-Memory Tables:  Formula 1 Performance Unleashed!
 
**Abstract**:
Query performance is what it is all about.  SQL Server 2014 now has the new in-memory functionality that takes a completely different approach to data access and manipulation.  Google “In-Memory Tables” and you’ll get a myriad of results from white papers, blogs, webinars, etc.  This session will consolidate the relevant information from all these sources so the production DBA/Developer will be able to understand, create, use, maintain, and trouble-shoot in-memory table functionality.  This session will also examine several demo scripts showing performance gains using the in-memory tables over equivalent disk based tables.  
This session is all about when and how to apply in-memory tables in a production environment.
After this session you will
1.	 Understand what in-memory tables are and how to create and maintain them including their limitations
2.	Be able to identify performance gains over equivalent disk back tables
3.	Comprehend the new data monitoring needed for in-memory tables

## Title: Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort.  Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables?  Need to move 500 databases to a different drive?  Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds.  I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes.  Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you.
Here you’ll learn:
•	The most useful regular expression commands.
•	The appropriate times to use regular expressions.
•	How to use regular expressions to write code for you.
•	How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.

## Title: INDEXING 101 - WHAT IS AN INDEX?
 
**Abstract**:
If your eyes glaze over when you read the terms 'clustered index' or 'non-clustered index', and you think you really ought to know what these are, this may just be the session for you.

This session is designed for those new to database design/development. If you have some idea of how databases and tables are used, but need a (re)grounding in the basic concepts of indexing and how to use them to your advantage, you will benefit from this session. You will leave knowing what a clustered index is, what a non-clustered index is, when to use them, how to use them, their advantages and disadvantages. We will start at a very high level with simple examples and basic definitions, and then go into details of how indexes work and practical examples of index usage in T-SQL.

## Title: Scripting out SQL Server for Documentation and Disaster Recovery
 
**Abstract**:
Most DBAs need to use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects.
Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exportable and live at the server level, above the database.
Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for moving or recovering a SQL server instance for Disaster Recovery purposes.
Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, and Server Triggers

In this session I’ll show you the benefits to Minion Reindex and Minion Backup: 
•	Simple installation and configuration for all shops, large or small
•	Single or multi-server installation script
•	Table-based configuration eliminates the need for excessive jobs
•	Highly customizable options
•	Flexible include and exclude options, including the use of regular expressions

## Title: Automating Your Database Deployments
 
**Abstract**:
Deploying your database changes to production can be nerve-wracking. We'll discuss methods that take the stress out of the process by ensuring that you practice your deployments using continuous integration before you ever get near production. Automating the deployment and testing processes through various pre-production environments can make the whole experience of production deployments more repeatable, more reliable and more robust.

In this session, we'll explore the concepts of continuous integration and continuous delivery for databases – what to consider, the challenges, the benefits, the testing, and the crucial approval gates necessary for a reliable production deployment. We'll discuss these and other release strategies as you think about how to evolve your deployment pipeline towards a more automated approach, starting with continuous integration and ending at your production systems.

## Title: SQL Security Best Practices  Shrinking Your Attack Surface
 
**Abstract**:
Every industry has a governing body or standard that requires some layer of security to your data. In my travels I have come to realize that when someone mentions security, DBA's tend to get frightened. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the requirements or not knowing what SQL Server offers to meet those requirements. In this session we will go over what SQL Server has to offer, Security Best Practices and how you can shrink your attack surface to meet Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of your Servers and Data. In addition, attending this talk is worth 1.5 Continuing Education credits.
