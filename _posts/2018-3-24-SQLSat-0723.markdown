##Title: I lost my job!  Now what?!?  A survival guide for the unemployed##
 
**Abstract**:
You've just been told by HR that you are no longer a part of their organization.  You've been kicked to the curb.  You are now living in the no-man's land called unemployment.

Unemployment is a scary situation.  You're dealing with emotions and uncertainty.  You don't know if you'll be out of work for days, weeks, or months.

Fortunately, unemployment is survivable.  In this session, I'll share my own experiences (and perhaps we'll talk about some of yours) with unemployment, and how I managed to get through the tough times.  We'll discuss emotional impact, the job hunt, and things you can do to get yourself through this tough time.  Hopefully, you'll land on your feet once again before long!

##Title: Should I move my database to the cloud?##
 
**Abstract**:
So you have been running on-prem SQL Server for a while now.  Maybe you have taken the step to move it from bare metal to a VM, and have seen some nice benefits.  Ready to see a TON more benefits?  If you said "YES!", then this is the session for you as I will go over the many benefits gained by moving your on-prem SQL Server to an Azure VM (IaaS).  Then I will really blow your mind by showing you even more benefits by moving to Azure SQL Database (PaaS/DBaaS).  And for those of you with a large data warehouse, I also got you covered with Azure SQL Data Warehouse.  Along the way I will talk about the many hybrid approaches so you can take a gradual approve to moving to the cloud.  If you are interested in cost savings, additional features, ease of use, and ending the days of upgrading hardware, this is the session for you!

##Title: Disaster Documents: The role of documentation in disaster recovery##
 
**Abstract**:
I was an employee of a company that had an office in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.  Prior to that infamous date, I had written several departmental documents that ended up being critical to our recovery.  In this presentation, I provide a narrative of what happened in the weeks following 9/11, and how documentation played a role in getting the organization back on its feet.

While other disaster recovery presentations talk about strategies, plans, and techniques, this presentation focuses on the documentation itself.  We will discuss the documents we had and how they were used in our recovery.  We will also discuss what documents we didn't have, and how they could have made the process better.

##Title: Big Data and Hadoop: A primer for the weary DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
Big Data has become a corporate and household buzzword. But is it just that? You really need to start learning about it as soon as possible. Come learn about what happens to the tons of your personal data that you leave behind knowingly or unknowingly, like bread crumbs for various entities for the devil and the angel alike.
We'll also discuss various real life examples like detection and spread of Ebola virus, the 2016 elections, the traffic patterns in a third world country; all of this using Big Data.
You will also learn how Big Data is produced, processed(with cheap hardware using Hadoop like environments), reported and acted upon by producing meaningful and actionable reports/predictions.
Over and above, we'll also take a quick peek at some of the huge and successful installations of Hadoop ecosystems around the world; installations that affect our lives.

##Title: From (User) Story to Tables: Read Between the Lines to Find Your Data##
 
**Abstract**:
If you work in an agile environment, design requirements often come to us as stories with the phrase: "As a type of user, I want to ..."

For example: As a DBA, I want to be able to break down user stories to understand how they translate into our current database design and usage and have an understanding as to how it will affect future needs.

That user story is also the goal for the session. This will present one approach to how we can think about these user stories to find the data that we need to design our databases for. We'll even work through an example together. 

This is for DBAs who are involved in any part of designing databases, who want to practice how to come up with database designs, or who just another way to think about how they approach their database development in general.

##Title: New features in Management Studio and Showplan -- Performance Troubleshooting made easier!##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is now updated each month with the latest version of the SQL Client Tools.  Which enabled rapid enhancement to Execution Plan.  

Do you know that you can now see how many pages are spilled to disk for a sort, as well as the memory statistics for the operator? Are you aware that you can see the top 10 waits for an execution and what trace flags were active during compilation and which ones influenced compilation? Have you ever analyzed a big plan and wish you could search for table name, index name or column name without opening XML plan? When you see a clustered index was used do you know for sure which statistics were used by the Query Optimizer to estimate the number of rows? 

In this demo intensive session, I will show you how to find and use new features introduced into SSMS and Showplan.  You will walk out of this session equipped to make Query Performance Troubleshooting easier and ready to tackle those nasty, hard to solve query plans.

##Title: DBAs vs. Developers: JSON in SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
The war between DBAs and developers has been raging since the dawn of relational databases. One reason for disagreement comes from developers who want to store their data in JSON because it is fast, standard, and flexible. DBAs cringe when they hear of long text strings being stored in their SQL databases; they cry with concern, “No data validation? No schema binding?”. Is there any hope for these two warring factions to see eye-to-eye?

This session will explore the new JSON functionality introduced in SQL Server 2016. We will use T-SQL examples to learn how these functions can be used to parse, create, and modify JSON data. More importantly, we will discuss how to optimize performance when using these functions.

By the end of this session DBAs and developers will know how to efficiently work with JSON in SQL Server 2016 and 2017. It will also usher in an era of peace between DBAs and developers…

… at least until someone brings up the topics of cursors, NOLOCKs, or Entity Framework.

##Title: Running SQL Server in Amazon's Relational Database Service (RDS)##
 
**Abstract**:
Whether you're a developer who prefers SQL Server behind the scenes, or a DBA who is responsible for its care and feeding, RDS fits the bill nicely when it's time to move your databases to the cloud. There are many benefits from letting Amazon handle your database infrastructure, but managing your SQL Server in RDS is a little different from hosting it on your own hardware. Some things work differently from what you're used to, and there are a number of limitations that you should be aware of before diving in. 

In this session I will outline a number of the benefits of running your databases in the Amazon cloud. I will also highlight some of the limitations and differences that you'll encounter there. Whether you are a total beginner or a seasoned SQL Server veteran, if you're new to Amazon RDS, then this session is for you.

##Title: Pester your SQL Servers!##
 
**Abstract**:
As DBAs blur the lines between automation and software engineering, they must also employ sound software engineering principals.  One of these key principals is unit testing.  And just as you can automate DBA tasks, the same automation can be extended to unit testing.

This session will explore the PowerShell unit testing module Pester and how it can be applied to the automation code that a DBA creates.  We'll cover the basics of Pester, test driven development, how it can be employed by DBAs, and more.

This session will work through some light demos.  Familiarity with SQL Server database administration and PowerShell is helpful but not required.

##Title: Dynamic SQL: Writing Efficient Queries on the Fly##
 
**Abstract**:
Dynamic SQL can be a powerful tool that allows you to write fast  efficient queries when the specifics may not be known until run-time.  It can also be complex, difficult to read and debug, and the source of some of the most confusing TSQL you'll ever see.

Explore the many uses for dynamic SQL as well as best practices for writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining it, with the bonus of helping to improve the sanity of your coworkers (and your own) in the process!

##Title: Everyone Has a Story to Tell: Developing Your First Presentation##

##Title: How to use Spatial Data in SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
More and more applications/reports require handling of geospatial data. You may need to store maps, calculate distances between points or look for the closest locations to your users. Don't pay fees to third party tools for geospatial functionality, SQL Server is here to help you.
In the first half, learn the spatial data types and common spatial functions in SQL Server, and in the second, use the new JSON functions and In-Memory tables to create/query spatial data in SQL Server. Here's your chance to learn how to handle spatial data in SQL Server using modern ways.

##Title: Insight into the SQL Server Buffer Cache##
 
**Abstract**:
When we talk about memory usage in SQL Server, we are often referring to the buffer cache.  This is an important part of SQL Server’s architecture, and is responsible for the ability to query frequently accessed data quickly.  Knowing how the buffer cache works will allow us to properly allocate memory in SQL Server, gauge accurately how databases are accessing data, and ensure that there are not inefficiencies in our code that cause excessive data to be cached.

##Title: Painting with PowerShell: SQL Server Administration##
 
**Abstract**:
The SQL Server canvas gives us limitless opportunity for scripting and automation, and PowerShell is the perfect brush to paint with. Configuring our database servers, deploying database code changes, performing backups and restores are just a few examples of a day in the life of a DBA. Automation and scripting bring consistency, simplicity and scalability to many of these sometimes daunting tasks. 

Join me to learn how to paint your own SQL Server canvas with PowerShell.

##Title: I have to support what!?  SQL, Oracle, and Mongo -  A side by side “how to”##
 
**Abstract**:
More and more companies are starting to invest in multiple database platforms and DBAs are needing to develop a skillset to support a mixed-database environment.  Database concepts are often the same between platforms, however, the “how” can be very different (and sometimes not different at all!).  Starting with the basics and gradually moving into the more advanced; this session will show you how to perform the same task in SQL Server, Oracle, and Mongo.  Take a leap and start your journey in to the multi-platform world!

##Title: Uncovering Duplicate, Redundant,  Missing Indexes##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you know if your database's indexes are really being used to their fullest potential? And do you know if SQL Server needs other indexes to improve performance? 
Attend this session and learn how SQL Server tracks actual index usage, and how you can make use of that information to improve the state of indexes in your database. We will use this data to identify wasteful, unused,  redundant indexes, and explore performance penalties you pay for not addressing these inefficient indexes. Finally, we will dive into the Missing Index DMV and explore the art of evaluating its recommendations to make proper indexing decisions.
