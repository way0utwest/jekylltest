## Title: Azure Machine Learning – Bringing Advanced Analytics to the Masses
 
**Abstract**:
While Machine Learning is not new, it has never been easy to implement. Azure Machine Learning (AML) aims to provide a set of tools that are easier to use and once a model is created easier to consume by client applications. At the core of AML is ML Studio. ML Studio provides an easy to use graphical tool that allows you to control the process from pre-processing the data, to applying learning algorithms, testing the model, and finally deploying the model for use by client applications. This session guides you through the process of creating and deploying a ML model. In addition it will demonstrate how client applications can easily use the model once it is deployed.

## Title: Be Friendly to SQL Server with TSQL Best Practices
 
**Abstract**:
TSQL is a necessity when interacting with SQL Server so knowing can be half the battle. Performance is always good as the database starts to grow, but building in resilience when you begin is a greater advantage than refactoring. I will go over 5 key things to know when you write TSQL, use DataTypes and/or variables in comparisons and you will also learn about the procedure cache and how to avoid pitfalls there. This is a beginners session but the concepts in this session are a great foundation to begin with. If you are looking for a solid foundation to build on and need the basics to start, this session is definitely for you.

## Title: Maintenance Plans: Planning to Fail
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server MVP Mike Hillwig hates using maintenance plans. He believes they don't scale well and frequently lack flexibility.  Maintenance plans are easy to set up and deploy. Deploying them to many servers is cumbersome. Modifying them on multiple servers at once is an exercise in futility. 

The dirty little secret is that anything you can do with a maintenance plan can be done with T-SQL. And by leveraging several community-based solutions, you can accomplish anything without maintenance plans.

## Title: SQL 2016 Upgrade as a Project
 
**Abstract**:
As DBAs we are often stuck at the mercy of higher ups and Project Managers for completion of our assigned tasks/ projects.
In this session we wil actually take an arbitrary application and its affiliated databases and go throught the tasks/resources needed to accomplish the task. We will think and act like a Project Manager and DBA rolled into one. This will surely help you advance your career within organization and help you think ahead of time. We will use the PMI's approach to a project. We will examine ways to break down the large project into smaller Agile segments. We will look at various documents/forms/reports/steps and phases. 

This presentation will lay out this rather complex project into a simple laid out plan.

## Title: Efficient and Effective coding of Stored Procedures
 
**Abstract**:
Data does not become information until decision makers are able to view it and make those decisions that affect the enterprise as a whole. Stored procedures are one means of getting the data from the database tables to the reports in an effective and efficient manner.
In this hands-on presentation, we shall be looking at best practices with regards to creating and tuning stored procedures. We shall also be discussing parameter sniffing and other gotcha’s that affect us in our daily lives.

## Title: Taking the pain out of database migrations
 
**Abstract**:
Database migrations are scary. The migration of a database has many moving pieces and things to think about. Some of those things have nothing to do with the DBA and are outside of their control. However, if these items are not taken into account, it is the DBA that management will hold responsible for the failure. 

This session will discuss what you need to take into account to ensure a successful pain free database migration. These steps can be used for a single database, multiple databases, or an entire server. By the end of the session, you will have a checklist of the items you need to consider for a database migration.

## Title: Unseen Minions: Improving Parallel Processing in SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
Some SQL Server Integration Services use cases are too complicated to simply read data from a source and write it to a destination. You could try looking for a third-party framework or components to help, but then again, you might just need to add some knowledge. This session is designed to help you maximize the parallel processing capabilities of SSIS.

We’ll cover in detail alternative methods of managing large workloads by using traditional programming methods, including named pipes, queues, and producers/consumer architecture – all from within SSIS itself. We'll then cover methods of dividing workloads and preventing bottlenecks, as well as techniques to improve the resource efficiency of SSIS.

## Title: Using Powershell to Document SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Most DBAs need to use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects.
Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exportable and live at the server level, above the database.
Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for moving or recovering a SQL server instance for Disaster Recovery purposes.
Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, and Server Triggers

## Title: An Introduction To Big Data For The SQL Server DBA
 
**Abstract**:
The boss comes to you and says that he wants to implement big data technologies into your environment. Is this the end of your career with SQL Server? Where do you start learning about this rapidly changing world of big data? 

This presentation will answer all those questions, and will introduce you to the concepts that are the driving force behind a move to utilize "big data" technologies. It will introduce you to some of the key vendors and tools that are the most recognized today, which can help get a SQL Server DBA working on these systems very quickly. During the presentation we will cover those scenarios where big data technologies can be helpful, where they really just don't fit, and why.  

Finally, there will be an introduction on how Azure is playing a significant role in this move, and how this could potentially benefit you in your environment.  

So, come with an open mind, and be prepared to get excited about what a future with big data might hold for you!

## Title: The Art of War with Bad Code
 
**Abstract**:
Let’s face it, many of us are at war with poorly written or poorly tuned queries and processes. There is usually just one of you who has been tasked with managing one or more SQL Server instances while there are hundreds or even thousands of users of which a certain percentage will inevitably write poor code. So you must battle it out to identify the culprits before they wreak too much havoc on your systems. We will see several fairly straightforward techniques to positively identify the culprits and allow you to prioritize your efforts in tuning them to give you the biggest ROI for your time. TSQL and Extended Events code examples will be provided that you can use immediately in your environment to become more productive.

## Title: Virtual SQL Servers. Actual Performance.
 
**Abstract**:
Virtualizing your business-critical SQL Servers should not imply that they will run slower than if they were physical. When properly architected and managed, virtual SQL Servers should be equally as fast as their physical counterparts, if not faster. However, if not properly constructed, silent and seemingly random performance killers can strike and significantly hurt your database performance. 
This session is packed with many tips and tricks gained from years of experience for getting the most performance from your virtual SQL Servers. The major roadblocks to performance will be discussed and the knowledge gained will help you work with your infrastructure engineers so you can optimize the system stack for performance. Tools, techniques, and processes will be demonstrated to help you measure and validate the system performance of the key components underneath your data.

## Title: APPLY Yourself
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.
