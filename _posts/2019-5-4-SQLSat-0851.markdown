## Title: Daily indexing problems and its - possible - solution
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever been in the situation that an application performed well the last day and - suddenly - you run into problems? Although you have Index Maintenance jobs and statistics up to date you will monitor a big degrade of performance! This session will demonstrate in a over 80 percent demo based presentation the following scenarios which happend this way in real life!
- Why performance degradation in spite of maintenance jobs?
- just one more database in the result set and the query runs really bad - why?
- usage of literals is completely different from the usage of variables - why?
- identical data types but the query runs in part perfect and in part bad...
- your execution plan shows an INDEX SEEK - but the table will be scanned!
- you get a query from the business which performs really bad but when you test it it runs pretty cool - why?

## Title: Azure IoT, Windows 10 Core  Raspberry PI (DIY)
 
**Abstract**:
This session will begin, with a high level introduction to Azure Internet of Things, Windows 10 Core and Raspberry PI. Once we have established the basics about the technology, we will be connecting the dots with a live demo on some of the parts. The focus during the demo, will mainly be on Azure IoT Hub, Windows 10 Core and the Raspberry PI and how to DIY. As visualization we will be using Power BI to present the data.
This session is not for the Enterprise rather has a more DIY approach.

## Title: Arguing with myself - self-service BI from an infrastructure perspective
 
**Abstract**:
Self-service BI is coming, and as an infrastructure professional it's time to either get with the program or get run over. The infrastructure control that the IT department spent years consolidating is starting to unravel, and left to its own devices, self-service BI will spell as much technical doom as business boom. But what IS "self-service BI", what can it provide and why would the infrastructure people care? This session outlines how the notion of self-service BI really impacts the technical infrastructure, explains the risks of a governance disaster, and tells the story of how a Power BI implementation skirted disaster and turned into a success - all done in three different voices and from two different viewpoints.

## Title: Intelligent Query Processing in SQL Server 2019
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2017 started with query processing improvements called Adaptive Query Processing. Now, in SQL Server 2019 CTP2, there are additional improvements, and all of them are packed in a feature with the most promising name - Intelligent Query Processing. 

The intention of these improvements is to fix poor performing queries due to wrong cardinality estimations and other sub-optimal plan decisions, and hereby enhance query performance with almost no code changes. 

This session will cover briefly all these features: Batch and Row Mode Memory Grant Feedback, Batch Mode Adaptive Join and Interleaved Execution, Table Variable Deferred Compilation, and Approximate Query Processing.

The session will address questions such as do I need to tune queries anymore, does the IQP solves parameter sniffing issues and so on, and also suggest how much improvements you should expect with this promising set of feautures.

## Title: Extending DevOps To SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Most organizations are under pressure to speed up the software delivery cycle, whether that’s to respond more quickly to the needs of the business, the needs of your customers or just to keep up with the competition.  Unfortunately the database is commonly considered a bottleneck.  Without the right processes in place, database change management can slow things down, adding risk, uncertainty, and getting in the way of development and operations working together to deliver.  Any organization that wants to fully benefit from a DevOps approach is going to have to overcome some specific challenges presented by the database. This session will teach you how to take DevOps principles and practices and apply them to SQL Server so that you can speed up the database delivery cycle at the same time you protect the information contained within.

## Title: A refresher on geospatial data in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft introduced geospatial data types already in SQL Server 2008, some enhancements followed in version 2012. Today, geo data is used almost everywhere. Time to refresh your memories of geometry and geography!

We'll walk through which data types are supported - from 0 to 2 dimensions, from points to polygons and some more - and see how to get spatial data into and out of SQL Server tables.

Then there are built-in functions to determine relationships between geo objects, such as intersection, inclusion or shortest distance.
And of course there will be examples of practical applications of geospatial data.

## Title: Don't Cross the Streams! A Closer Look at Azure Stream Analytics
 
**Abstract**:
Azure is ready to receive all your event and device data for storage and analysis. But which options in the Azure message handling portfolio should you use to receive and manage your data? In this session I will explain the different options, take a closer look at how they work and what this means for you. Furthermore, I will take a closer look at the Azure Stream Analytics (ASA) language. You will learn how to develop both simple and complex ASA queries, and how to debug. We will look at the possibilities, limitations and pitfalls in the Azure Stream Analytics language. And finally, look at the different input and output choices and when to use which one. This includes a look at how to build a live stream dashboard with Stream Analytics data in PowerBI. The session is based on real world project experiences and will use real world data in the demos.

## Title: Construct Visual Data Flows by using Azure Data Factory
 
**Abstract**:
Moving and transforming data has always been, and will always likely be, a very large part of the day-to-day operational requirements of a data analytics practitioner.  Cloud technologies and "Big Data" have complicated this task to a degree, and understanding how to effectively and efficiently produce ETL/ELT data pipelines is a necessary skill in today's data landscape. 

In this session, attendees will be introduced to Azure Data Factory Mapping Dataflows, which allows users to develop comprehensive data pipelines using a graphical interface. These pipelines are executed in Azure Databricks, which provides a very efficient Spark-based execution context. Attendees will learn how to effectively build visual pipelines using common transformations, and will learn how to monitor and debug ETL and ELT pipelines by using Azure Data Factory.

## Title: Integrating Power BI and Azure Data Lake with dataflows and CDM Folders
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI dataflows are powered by Azure Data Lake Storage gen2, but by default the Power BI service manages the storage details. This is great for self-service data preparation and analyst-driven reuse, but Power BI doesn’t stop there. Through its support for CDM Folders, Power BI dataflows integrate with a wide range of Azure data services.

In this session, Power BI program manager Matthew Roche will explore integration scenarios between Power BI dataflows, Azure Data Lake Storage gen2, and additional Azure services such as Azure Data Factory. If you want to bridge the worlds of IT and self-service, and to enable easy reuse in both directions, this is a session you to not want to miss.

## Title: Analyzing Performance Problems Using XEvents, DMVs  Query Store
 
**Abstract**:
Extended Events, Dynamic Management Views, and Query Store are highly useful tools that give you a lot of data when analyzing performance problems. The challenge is which tool to use for which problems and how to correlate the data.

You are troubleshooting a performance problem in a business-critical database, a query is not completing, the users are complaining, and you are trying to understand what is happening. You have data from Extended Events, you are looking in the execution related DMVs, and now you are trying to find the query in Query Store. How do you put it all together?

In this session, we will look at how the tools work in different scenarios, how to correlate the data, and how you can use them in your performance troubleshooting.

**Abstract**:
Every new release of SQL Server brings a whole load of new features that an administrator can add to their arsenal of efficiency. SQL Server 2017 has introduced many new features. This session is carefully crafted to help overcome the beginner’s inertia for DBAs who have been using SQL Server for a while but aren't sure how to get started with the new features introduced in SQL Server 2017. 

Here is a glimpse of the features we will cover in this session:
• Adaptive query plans
• Batch mode adaptive join
• New cardinality estimates for optimal performance
• Indexing Improvements
• Automatic Tuning
• Memory optimizations

At the end of the session, DBAs will learn 3 essential processes which can be game changers for their career. After implementing the suggestions discussed in this session, DBAs will have extra time to handle more pressing issues which they were not able to focus on earlier.

## Title: 5 Critical Considerations When Moving to the Cloud
 
**Abstract**:
Migrating an existing on-premises SQL Server application to the cloud can be a daunting task that consists of many complicated steps. In this session, we will focus on what is perhaps the MOST important step of the process – those that lead up to the actual move to the cloud. 
We will dive deep into the most critical considerations for moving your data and databases into the cloud, whether you use Microsoft Azure, Amazon, or another cloud provider.
We will cover:
•	The importance of cleansing your data before a major migration
•	Fully documenting your data sources and metadata
•	Choosing from many different tools and techniques to actually move data
•	How to test data for fidelity
•	How to maintain parallel systems during transitional phases
We'll also share demos and overviews of native features within SQL Server that enable you to move data, as well as show powerful tools from the SentryOne product set that can make data migrations painless!

## Title: Off-load data from production using Replication  Change Tracking
 
**Abstract**:
A common problem is to have too much old data in the production database, which affects administration and sometimes also performance of the production environment. 
SQL Server comes with many tools that, when properly used, can make your life a whole lot easier; some of which are: SQLCMD scripting, the Change Tracking system, Transactional Replication and the MERGE command.
In this session you will be presented to a simple toolkit that will utilize these tools to set up synchronization of your production data to an offline database in a way that is easy to configure and manage. The toolkit contains a very small number of T-SQL and SQLCMD scripts together with a “How to” instruction, AND it´s available in SQL Server Standard edition!

## Title: SQL Server Magic Show
 
**Abstract**:
The most beautiful and fun way to get know the depths of SQL Server is through magic. You will see a series of SQL Server experiments that look like a trick or illusion. But they are not. It is just exploiting the deep knowledge of how SQL works. This will deepen your knowledge and increase ability to solve real-world challenges.
The tricks:
Select count(*) from table - returns wrong count (any # you like)
Deadlock - single statement, without transactions
Database - without files
Online index changes - on Standard edition
Reading plaintext data of TDE-encrypted database - without SQL access

## Title: Working in Batches
 
**Abstract**:
Early in your career you learnt that loops are bad and that you should use set-based statements. However, there are situations when trying to processing all at once takes you into problems. In this session we will learn what these situations are and how we can address them by splitting up the work in batches. We will learn techniques for batching and pitfalls to watch out for so that we don't introduce new performance issues.

We will also look at batching from a different angle: problems that requires a loop for, say, a single customer, but where we can process all customers abreast for better performance.
