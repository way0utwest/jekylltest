## Title: Unit Testing your SQL Server database with SSDT
 
**Abstract**:
Creating automated unit tests to validate the logic of a unit/method/function of .NET code is nothing new, but many of the day-to-day applications we develop have business logic in the database tier that can be difficult to validate and regression test.  SQL Server Data Tools allows developers to create Test Projects, which can be used to build up a repository of automated tests designed to validate the functionality of the objects in a SQL Server database (e.g. Constraints, Stored Procedures, UDFs, View, etc).  In this session we will demonstrate how to use SSDT Test Projects to unit test your databases.  This presentation is almost entirely demonstration of the tools, but there are a couple slides to review :-)

## Title: Manageable SSAS Deployment Strategies
 
**Abstract**:
When it comes to making changes to your production Analysis Services databases, do you simply open the SSAS DB in SQL Server Data Tools (or BIDS) and click through creating the changes? Does this method lead to problems keeping everything in sync and the right changes deployed to the right environment at the right time? Have you, the BI developer, had to fight to get Production access to do your own deployments?

If you've answered "yes" to any of these questions, and are in search of a better way, I have the solution! In this demo-heavy session, will look at five steps to more robust, controllable, and flexible Tabular and Multidimensional SSAS deployments.

## Title: Top 10 Admininistrator Mistakes on SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on the market.  But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy, nor does it mean is problem free. After all, many apps are growing from small, home-grown applications every year, with green IT professionals encountering issues that others had tackled and solved years ago.  Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again. There is a short list of mistakes that, if you know of them in advance, will make your life much easier. Once you apply the lessons learned from this session, you’ll find yourself performing at a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness than before.

## Title: PowerShell for Data Professionals
 
**Abstract**:
You’ve heard it said, “If you have to do it twice, automate it.” Cut the learning curve and get a real handle on this powerful automation tool. This session walks you through a dozen scripts to simplify and easily automate time-consuming and tedious elements of your day to day job. This isn’t stuff you’ll use SOMEDAY, these are scripts you can use when you get home tonight. Harness the power of Power Shell to easily find Servers short on space. Script out tables and constraints across all of your databases at once. Backup databases and restore them to a different environment. These tricks and many others will allow PowerShell to simplify your job like no other tool.

## Title: Dive into the Query Optimizer-Undocumented Insight
 
**Abstract**:
This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.

## Title: Using PowerView and Hadoop to Unlock Hidden Market
 
**Abstract**:
A practical way to derive business value from big data is to microtarget customers, but where do you begin? In this session, we examine real data from one of the nation's largest cable TV providers and combine it with data from the 2010 census and other data sources. In addition, we demonstrate how to use Hadoop and the Microsoft BI stack with this integrated data to develop powerful analytics quickly and easily. We demystify the process of working with big data by showing you first how to gather and load the data into Hadoop, and then how to extract a subset of that data and apply data visualization to reveal insightful patterns that can be used to connect more effectively with customers.

## Title: Into the Blue: Extending AlwaysOn Availability Groups
 
**Abstract**:
For many organizations, having a second data center or co-location center doesn’t make sense, financially or logistically. Typically, this would limit options for building out a disaster recovery (DR) solution. However, now with Windows Azure virtual machines and SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups, you can connect your on-premise solution to a real-time secondary replica, providing read scalability and a solid DR solution.

This session will demonstrate how to extend an Availability Group into Windows Azure, discussing the pros and cons as well as the cost of the solution. You will walk away with a solid understanding of AlwaysOn functionality within Windows Azure VMs, the costs and benefits of building a DR solution within Windows Azure, and how Azure-based backup and recovery can work.

## Title: Big Data! What's the Big Deal?
 
**Abstract**:
For decades humans have been collecting data in ever increasing formats and exponentially increasing volumes. Data collection tools have historically outnumbered data analytics tools, hence leading to a huge backlog of raw data waiting to be analyzed. This backlog has increased dramatically in recent years with the explosion of social media and the advent of a plethora of Internet connected devices. The challenge in clearing the backlog was exacerbated by requirements imposed by various analytics technologies to get data into common formats that would then be pumped into standardized data models.  The big data revolution challenges this approach by tapping into various, high velocity and large volume sources to identify correlations and patterns that we could only dream of identifying using traditional analytic technologies. In this presentation I will discuss the history of big data tools and will briefly discuss Microsoft HDInsight,an Apache Hadoop compatible Big Data implementation.

## Title: Data Vault – What is it?  Where Does It Fit?
 
**Abstract**:
As a Data Warehouse / ETL developer who sometimes waits weeks or months without capturing or loading any source data while a new data warehouse / mart target model is being defined, would you instead like to be able get ahead of the curve by – quickly and mostly automatically – designing and even loading a robust and fully history-tracking DW / staging repository?  Or, have the recent requests from sponsors – requests that your DW reporting / analytics solution also supply data for upcoming Master Data Management needs – got you a little nervous about your data transformations?  If either of these scenarios resonate, you will appreciate Data Vault, an emerging DW design and architecture.  Leaving this session, you will be familiar with Data Vault’s simple design fundamentals, appreciate its potential for task automation, and understand where and when it fits your needs.

## Title: Taking BI to the Next Level: Collaboration
 
**Abstract**:
Self-service BI is usually an independent activity. But when individuals discover interesting information that they want to share, they need a centralized location to do that. When people work together, new insights are possible, and that’s what collaboration is all about. As more people see the benefits of the solution, they become more likely to use it. As individual products, SQL Server 2008 R2, SharePoint 2010, and Excel 2010 expand your options for enabling BI in your organization, but collectively they create a solid platform for collaborative BI. Knowing which tool to use for which job can be tricky. Come to this session to learn how to use these tools to foster collaboration.

## Title: How Flash Storage Modernizes Databases
 
**Abstract**:
For decades the characteristics of spinning hard drives have acted as a tail wagging the dog requiring the processes and behaviors of software, architecture and administrators to bend to its requirements. With the advent of a new technology, flash storage, comes the unleashing of a new round of performance potential as well as a shedding of long encumbering patterns. Modernizing databases is about both vastly boosting performance and also significantly reducing the complexity and effort to maintain them. Come see a deep dive into how ultra-fast and random-optimized storage is modernizing database performance, architecture and maintenance.

Query optimizers are highly complex pieces of software, which even after 40 years of research, still face several technical challenges in some fundamental areas. As a result, there may be cases when even after you've provided the query optimizer with all the information it needs, you still don’t get an efficient execution plan for your queries. This session will show you the current challenges and limitations of query optimizers in general and the SQL Server query optimizer in particular, along with solutions or workarounds to avoid each of these problems.

## Title: Best Practices for Database Deployment
 
**Abstract**:
The easiest part of any deployment is running the deployment script on production. But what have you done to prepare that script for production? Was the script tested? Is the script tightly coupled with the application code? 

The difference between a successful deployment and a failed or problematic deployment is all the preparation work you’ve done to ensure that you’re deploying the right script, the right way to your production environment. This session will explore best practices that you can implement within your environment   to ensure that your deployments are as successful as they can be.
