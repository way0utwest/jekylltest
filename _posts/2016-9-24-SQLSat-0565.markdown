## Title: How to monitor efficiently your SQL Server instances
 
**Abstract**:
Do you plan to start monitoring your SQL Server instances soon and asking yourself what should you measure? Are you questioning if your existing monitoring data can detect and alert if a performance problem occurs? Is the data you collected from monitoring enough to pinpoint the cause of your next performance problem?

I have worked with SQL Server as a developer in the Redmond team for more than 12 years and during this time I've investigated countless performance problems. In time I developed a strategy on how to use the performance monitoring data to analyze problems and identify the root cause. This session is going to to show you how I monitor SQL Server, what data do I look for, and how I interpret the collected data to analyze performance issues. Going beside the obvious CPU, Memory and IO counters, I will show you how to identify typical performance issues from monitoring data, all without overwhelming the captured data volume.

## Title: 2,4,8  16 - Upgrade your journey with SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
2,4,8  16 - these aren't just numbers to count or calculate. These are years that how SQL Server evolved as number of years!

Why Upgrade? 
Data Platform Upgrade topic has been a popular session that I've presented in major conferences like Microsoft Tech-Ed (North America, Europe  India) and SQLbits since 2008. 

In this session, we will overview in depth end-to-end upgrade process that covers the essential phases, steps and issues involved in upgrading  SQL Server (2000 to  2012),  SQL Server 2014 (with a good overview on 2016 too) by using best practices and available resources. 

What to-do and what not-to-do?

A popular session that I have been presenting since the year 2008, in MS Tech-Ed, SQL Saturday  SQLbits UK.
We will cover the complete upgrade cycle, including the preparation tasks, upgrade tasks, and post-upgrade tasks. Real-world examples from my Consulting experience expanding on why  how such a solution.

## Title: Troubleshooting Performance in SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
The SQL Server Query Store is one of the most known features of SQL Server 2016 that provides insight on query plan choice and performance.  It simplifies performance troubleshooting by enabling you to quickly find performance differences caused by changes in query plans. 
However in this session we will explore not just Query Store but also additional features that allow performance troubleshooting in SQL Server 2016.

## Title: Think  work like a Data Scientist with SQL 2016 R
 
**Abstract**:
What are these DATA Scientists up to? How can we see their statistical model in our day to day familiar tool like Microsoft SQL Server?

You now have answers to these questions and thanks to Microsoft for integrating R Revolution within new SQL Server 2016. We all now have the opportunity to use R packages and see the results within SQL 2016.

In this session, you will definitely take away a breakthrough concept of Advanced R Analytics within SQL 2016 and get ready to kick your creative horse, and go beyond your imagination on how you can build advanced analytics and impress your employers/customers.

## Title: SQL Server Azure VMs - your databases in the cloud
 
**Abstract**:
While Microsoft Azure SQL Database can be an option for moving our databases to the cloud, as DBAs we still want to have full control on the SQL Server instances and on the resources we have available, so moving our databases to a SQL Server Azure VM is the way to go.

Let's have a look at what the Azure IaaS has to offer when it comes to migrating the SQL Server to the cloud and what are some of the best practices when you decide to do so, while touching both on the pros and cons of such a decision.
We will be covering the details of setting up a SQL Server Azure VM, emphasizing what are the requirements for a highly available and high performance system.

**Abstract**:
It won’t be long before we host the majority of our data, compute power, reporting, and BI visualizations in the cloud, but we’re not all there quite yet. In this presentation, we will discuss ONLY those options that are available on-premises, covering functionality differences between Power BI and Power BI Desktop as well as the critical integration of .pbix dashboards and visualizations with other enterprise reporting and collaboration tools, such as SharePoint, PowerPoint, Excel, and SQL Server Reporting Services. We’ll also highlight the Microsoft BI roadmap for SQL Server 2016, SSRS, Power BI, Mobile Reports, and what it means specifically for on-premise customers.
