## Title: "Beyond BIDS" - Caring for and Feeding a SQL Serve
 
**Abstract**:
Are you a Business Intelligence developer? Have you built a SQL Server Reporting Services, Analysis Services or Integration Services solution? Have you deployed to a test server and are wondering "Now what?" Or are you a production SQL Server DBA who's been informed that since SSAS, SSIS or SSRS have "SQL" in their name, you have to take over the day-to-day management of a SQL BI project? This fast-paced session will look at what it takes to manage and administer projects created with the SQL Server BI products. We'll look at the management tools, deployment lifecycles, security capabilities and disaster recovery processes for these products. We'll see why, if you're a developer, you might still need your DBA, or if you're a DBA, you might

## Title: A Data Mining Solution
 
**Abstract**:
One of my clients, the Department of Human Services, wants to predict which children that leave foster care will have to return to foster care at later date.  Modern day computing power along with SQL Server makes it possible to add sophisticated data mining models to our applications that forecast and predict, perform anomaly detection, and classify data.  This presentation will demonstrate how to develop a data mining model using Analysis Services from conception to deployment using internal and external data, and you will see how to get and display results.  Take a step forward towards making BI pervasive in your organization by integrating data mining into your companyâ€™s applications.

## Title: Documentation. You know you love it
 
**Abstract**:
We will discuss some of the most important things that you as a Data Professional can document to make your job much easier, ensure information consistency between groups, and better prepare your organizations for raising the bar on your day to day business.  Think of this as a sort of Database Library that allows you to finally detail the processes you follow currently to perform repetitive tasks.  
This Library will also allow you to simply document your systems for your and others knowledge.

## Title: Visual Studio 2010 Database Projects 
 
**Abstract**:
Managing DDL scripts has always been one of the biggest challenges facing Database Developers. How do you keep your Development, Test, Stage, and Production Environments in sync? Why aren't databases tightly integrated into source control systems like application code is? Visual Studio 2010 Database projects solve all these problems and more. In this session, we will learn how to use Visual Studio to treat database objects as the first-class citizens they have always been.

## Title: Hardware 201: Selecting Database Hardware
 
**Abstract**:
The foundation of database performance is the underlying server hardware and storage subsystem. Even the best designed and optimized database application can be crippled by an inadequate hardware and storage infrastructure. Recent advances in new processors and chipsets, along with improvements in magnetic and SSD storage have dramatically changed the evaluation and selection process compared to the past. Many database professionals struggle to keep up with new technology and often simply let someone else make their hardware selection and sizing decisions. Don't let this happen to you! This session covers current and upcoming hardware from both Intel and AMD.

## Title: Helpdesk to DBA in 60-ish minutes
 
**Abstract**:
Most â€˜accidental DBAsâ€™ start their foray in to database administration in a similar way.  You start with little knowledge of SQL server and maybe even little knowledge of system administration basics at all.  I will share some tips and tricks that I have picked up over the years to help you get on your feet as a DBA, by showing you how to find out where your instances of SQL are, what business processes depend on them, what their current states are and how to learn the skills you need to keep your databases safe and available.
