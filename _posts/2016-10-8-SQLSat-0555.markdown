## Title: SQL Server Security – Netzwerkkabel ziehen ist keine Lösung  [DE]
 
**Abstract**:
Schon lange ist Sicherheit in der IT ein Thema mit hohem Stellenwert. Dabei steht der Schutz der unternehmenseigenen Daten und der Daten der Kunden an oberster Stelle. Doch wie Schütze ich meine Daten? Die Absicherung der Applikationen, Berechtigungen und Secure Code ist nur ein Teil eines sicheren Systems. Des Weiteren gehört auch die Absicherung der Infrastruktur und des SQL Servers selbst zu einem sicheren System. 
Der SQL Server liefert hier eine Vielzahl an Funktionen, welche mit SQL Server 2016 sogar noch um interessante Features wie Always Encrypted, Row Level Security oder Data Masking  erweitert werden.
Diese Session bietet einen Überblick über die wichtigsten Security Features des SQL Servers und anhand eines realen Beispiels durchleuchten wir die Absicherung der SQL Server Landschaft.

## Title: Are You a DBA by Accident? Welcome to the Club! [DE]
 
**Abstract**:
When I joined runtastic.com to build their very first centralized data warehouse with Microsoft SQL Server, no one really felt in charge of the server – so the responsibility fell into my humble hands. Besides my duties as a business intelligence architect (designing  implementing the database, ETL  cube), I had to quickly come up with a solution for the most important administrative tasks:
•	Disaster Recovery and Failover
•	Database Maintenance
•	Capacity Management
•	Job  Performance Monitoring
In this session I will invite you to discuss the pros  cons of the solutions I came up with and you will leave the session with helpful concepts and scripts which you can use freely.

## Title: Daily problems with indexing and its - possible - solution [DE]
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever been in the situation that an application performed well the last day and - suddenly - you run into problems? Although you have Index Maintenance jobs and statistics up to date you will monitor a big degrade of performance! This session will demonstrate in a over 80 percent demo based presentation the following scenarios which happend this way in real life!
- Why performance degradation in spite of maintenance jobs?
- just one more database in the result set and the query runs really bad - why?
- usage of literals is completely different from the usage of variables - why?
- identical data types but the query runs in part perfect and in part bad...
- your execution plan shows an INDEX SEEK - but the table will be scanned!
- you get a query from the business which performs really bad but when you test it it runs pretty cool - why?

## Title: T-SQL User-Defined Functions, or: Bad Performance Made Easy [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
User-defined functions in SQL Server are very much like custom methods and properties in .Net languages. At first sight, they seem to be the perfect tool to introduce code encapsulation and reuse in T-SQL. So why is this feature mostly avoided by all T-SQL gurus?
The reason is performance. In this session, you will learn how user-defined functions feed the optimizer with misleading and insufficient information, how the optimizer fails to use even what little information it has, and how this can lead to shocking query performance.
However, you will also see that there is a way to avoid the problems. With just a little extra effort, you can reap the benefits of code encapsulation and reuse, and still get good performance.

## Title: Hybrid BI [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
With the introduction of SQL 2016 and all its new features, Hybrid BI is more in focus then ever. Doing BI is no longer bound to be on-premise or in the cloud. With all the new features and the Azure platform Microsoft has made it easier then ever to implement a hybrid platform.

When working with a hybrid platform your organisation will be able to select strategy and features based on the highest ROI. During this session I will go through three different aspects of Hybrid BI which is infrastructure, data-storage and reporting. 

As part of this i will go through the advantages and disadvantages of each area to supply you with the information you need to choose the right direction for your platform.

## Title: NSA Secrets - Hacking SQL Server [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
How easy is it to hack a SQL Server? 
In this session we'll see a few examples on how to exploit SQL Server, modify data and take control, while at the same time not leaving a trace.
We'll start by gaining access to a SQL Server (using some "creative" ways of making man-in-the-middle attacks), escalating privileges and tampering with data at the TDS protocol level (e.g. changing your income level and reverting without a trace after payment), and more. 
Most importantly, we'll also cover recommendations on how to avoid these attacks, and take a look at the pros and cons of new security features in SQL Server 2016.
This is a demo-driven session, suited for DBAs, developers and security consultants (Jedi level). 
Disclaimer: No actual state secrets will be revealed. Please do not send agents to my house again.

## Title: 2016! Data transformation with M, SSIS, POLY, ADF, ADLA, R [DE]
 
**Abstract**:
It is 2016! Launch year! For the Data Platform Community at no time there were more possibilities and tools to transform data with Microsoft than today! This session will help you to find a way through the jungle. Based on a use case, we compare the tool sets in live demos and show the different approaches and when to choose what. We provide a decision matrix including the comparison by the variety of data sources, learning curve, security, scalability and many more. 
In this comparison you will find "M" (Power Query Language), SSIS (Integration Services), POLY (Polybase integration in SQL Server 2016), ADF (Azure Data Factory), ADLA (Azure Data Lake Analytics / U-SQL) and R (the Statistical Scripting Language that ships now with SQL 2016)
This gives you a good starting point for new data transformation projects or to review existing under the new approaching technologies.

## Title: Fun with SQL Server 2016 Stretch Database, Temporal  Always Encrypted [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
Your cold data growth is getting out of control, storage consumption is increasing faster than your budget, your end-users won't (or can't) tell you what can delete or truncate, but they demand their cold or archived data always be online and available. Now you have tables so big that you dread re-indexing, and you have to look for ever more creative solutions to manage this data, while still remaining compliant. There’s a solution that lets you take advantage of the Cloud, on your terms, all without impacting your existing end-user applications or queries. Come find out how you can move your data securely and transparently, free up disc space and reduce your enterprise storage consumption, while retaining full control from the on-premises SQL Server. You’ll reduce maintenance operations time and resources, plus lower overall cost. Learn how SQL Server Stretch database will simplify your journey to the Cloud!

## Title: Kerberos for BI [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever seen this message quot;Login failed for user ‘NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGONquot; ?
Have you ever witnessed Kerberos mentioned in a conversation - or in a forum - and seen developers shiver, sysadmins crawl back under their rock and project managers fear for the consumed hours ?
Have you ever wondered why it seems so complicated ?
If you answered yes to any of these question then this demo-packed session is for you.
Because Kerberos is something that anyone who must deploy SQL Server wishes they didn’t have to worry about. It truly affects all aspects of SQL Server including the engine, Reporting Services, Analysis Services, SharePoint and PowerPivot. Furthermore we will have a close look at how to diagnose problems and troubleshoot the three-headed beast when it breaks loose.
This session is based on many hours spent sweating in setting up Kerberos in BI and SharePoint environments and explaining support people how to troubleshoot and fix Kerberos issues when they a

## Title: SQL Server Replication - What, How and Why [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
In an AlwaysOn world we focus on entire databases being highly available. However, replication offers another, arguably more powerful, way to make data available on multiple servers/locations that steps outside of "normal" High Availability scenarios. 

This session will explain what database replication is, what the different parts are that make up the replication architecture and when/why you would use replication. You will leave the session with an understanding of how you can leverage this feature to achieve solutions that are not possible using other High Availability features. 

The content will be valid for all versions of SQL Server from 2005 onward.

## Title: Are You Optimistic About Concurrency? [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
What exactly does it mean to have optimistic concurrency? What is the alternative? Is SQL Server 2012#39;s SNAPSHOT Isolation optimistic? How can SQL Server 2014’s In-Memory OLTP provide truly optimistic concurrency? In this session, we’ll look at what guarantees the various isolation levels provide, the difference between pessimistic and optimistic concurrency, and the new data structures in SQL Server 2014 that allow the enormous benefits of having totally in-memory storage with no waiting!

## Title: Using R in SQL Server, Power BI, and Azure ML [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
In SQL Server, Azure ML, and Power BI suites, you can find nearly anything you need for analyzing your data. SQL Server 2016 closes one of the last gaps - support for statistics beyond basic aggregate functions and support for other mathematical calculations. This is done with support for the R code inside SQL Server Database Engine. This session goes beyond showing the basics, i.e. how to use R in the Database Engine, Power BI and Reporting Services reports, and to enhance Azure ML; it shows and explains also some advanced statistical and matrix calculations.

## Title: Deep-Dive into Polybase of SQL Server 2016 [DE]
 
**Abstract**:
Polybase is a feature originally coming from APS but is now finally also available in native SQL Server 2016. It allows you to query external data sources, foremost Hadoop, directly from within SQL Server and combine it with any other data that already resides in your database. Especially the rise of the whole Hadoop data platform in the current markets makes this feature very interesting and is definitely worth a closer look. This session will guide you through the process of setting up Polybase on Hadoop and Azure Blob Stores, showing some real-world use-cases and highlight the most common pitfalls that you may encounter.

## Title: Powershell community scripts for DBAs [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
There are many community scripts out there that DBAs can use without having to write them yourself. Like Ola Hallengrens scripts, or Brent Ozars or sp_WhoIsActive by Adam Machanic. But how about Powershell? Turns out, this world is still a bit unknown to the DBA but there is a fast growing community with extremely useful scripts for day to day SQL Server management. In this session we will take a look into my favourite scripts and we will also write a bit of Powershell ourselves.

## Title: What Application Developers Should Know About SQL Server? [DE]
 
**Abstract**:
Nowadays many companies don't have dedicated developer positions. Therefore the most of the SQL code has been written by application developers. And they use only a subset of SQL Server features and usually in a suboptimal manner.
I spent last ten years working with application developers and have collected common mistakes and misunderstandings between them and DBAs that increase development, test and deployment costs and reduce the overall quality.
In this session we will cover the most important things they need to know about SQL Server and that cannot be easily or cheap fixed by DBAs or consultants.
