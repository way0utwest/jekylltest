##Title: Dare to build vertical design with relational data##
 
**Abstract**:
Entity-Attribute-Value model is often called “anti-pattern” by the criticism. And probably they would be right if one misses to read the “Handle with Care” label on it. Enthusiastic inexperienced developers would easily compromise the benefits of relational DB but the coin has yet another side. Hierarchical object with thousands of properties, unknown schema, flexibility and millions of records. As always – we have to sacrifice one thing in order to win another. Then all it comes to priorities and ability for decision making. 
At this lecture you will not get a step-by-step manual but instead get ideas for how to build one for you.
A challenge, a proof of concept, hard work and successful project for millions – that is the story to share.

##Title: TSQL Performance Tips##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server optimizer doesn't use and index seek for execution of your query although the quer is high selective? What is better, when and why: LIKE vs: SUBSTRING, IN vs. EXISTS, SUBQUERY vs. JOIN. Why you should not use the UPPER or LOWER functions? How to avoid non-SARG-able WHERE clauses? Which query takes about 3 minutes in SQL Server 2008 and only one second in SQL Server 2012?

In this session we will answer these questions and show how bad designed queries lead to poor execution plans. We will offer recommendations and tips how to avoid performance problems caused by poor query design (functions in WHERE clause, data type conversions…) and explain how local variables and parameters affect the generation of execution plan.

##Title: High Availability of SQL  in the context of SLA##
 
**Abstract**:
If SQL Server is heart of our environment, his health should be very important, right? If SQL Server is important, his availability for our businesses (internal and external) is important to. For our customers doesn't matter where data are stored, how are stored and what we do with those data. Especially for our managers. The data must be available on demand, on time, at he moment of request. High Availability is our responsibility. How we can prepare our environment for HA? How HA is connected for with SLA? And why Service Level Agreement are important for us? In this session I want to discuss about HA options for SQL Server (2008, 2012), about our different customers, and about Service Level Agreement (formal or not).

##Title: Spatial Data with SQL Server Reporting Services##
 
**Abstract**:
Spatial Data Visualization is one of the key new features of SQL Server Reporting Services. This feature was introduced in SQL Server 2008 

R2 and continues to evolve in the new SQL Server 2012. SQL Server provided geospatial data from SQL Server 2008 and you may have 

noticed (or perhaps used) the two geospatial data types in SQL Server: geometry and geography. In this lecture we will talk about how to 

visualize spatial data in the SQL Server Reporting Services, creating Map reports. We will learn how to set reporting services and how to use 

spatial data with this product. Samples will demonstrate work with Reporting Services for both SQL Server 2008 R2 and SQL Server 2012.

##Title: Welcome to the Licensing Nightmare##
 
**Abstract**:
Are You remember "Sliders"? In my opinion Licensing World is similar to this series. How many time You tried to understand licensing? How many times You heard different opinions about same question? I'm sure, that You know what is CPU, CORE, SOCKET. Are You familiar with Processor / User / Device? And CAL / SAL/ SA too? Are You use SPLA program or just OEM or MOLP? Physical Instance, Virtual Instance, 90 Days, EULA, SPUR, LAR, Multiplexing, 5 Dollars (not 5 Cents)... It's not all the possibilities, if we are talking about licenses. Let's talk about it, from the Licensing Point of View

##Title: Practical SQL query monitoring and optimization##
 
**Abstract**:
Today the project owners demand results as soon as possible and most often - for yesterday. Time to market is crucial and it is practical to deliver bit-by-bit, get feedback and grow with the number of your customers. But as the project grows, the team does too and not all have the same expertise. As well rarely in the beginning the requirements clear enough to allow performance-wise SQL interaction.
In most cases there does not exist an ORM that can solve this task for you and you will need to have hard T-SQL writer in the team. If you already know this story or are going this way then in this practical session we will share how to monitor, measure and optimize your SQL code and DB layer interaction.

##Title: The good, the bad and the ugly of SQL Server param##
 
**Abstract**:
What is happening behind the scenes when you think you send a query to SQL Server? What is the surprise when you find out that the same query is performing differently every time? You think you parameterize well, or your query is using the already compiled execution plan. Let’s think again and let’s talk more about SQL Server query caches, parameterization and query plan problems in order to understand what’s going on behind the scenes and how to avoid the ugly things happening with your query performance

##Title: Database corrupt! What’s next?##
 
**Abstract**:
Corruption happens! Realize that! Do not just cross your fingers, you have choices to save your data. When corruption occurs pressing the panic button is not an option, but knowing what exactly to do in order to minimize a data loss and down time. Backups are sometimes the best way to minimize the data loss, but not necessarily the down-time. The session explains what to do when corruption occurs in order to reduce data loss and downtime, how to act proactively minimizing corruption. Having this knowledge can make DBAs more confident to dealing these problems themselves and improve their skills
