## Title: Processing Flat Files with SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
When doing data integration, a common requirement is to work with flat files, whether for importing data into a system from an external source, or to export it to provide to other systems. SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) supports flat files, but there can be a number of challenges when working with them. This is particularly true if your flat files have multiple data formats contained in a single file, the data has complex formatting, or the files have inconsistent formatting. This session will help you to be more efficient when working with these types of files. You’ll learn to handle missing delimiters in the files, and parsing files that have multiple data formats. You’ll also see how to produce complex output formats.

## Title: Do You Know the Data Flow?
 
**Abstract**:
The Data Flow task is one of the most powerful and most complex tools available in SSIS. Whether you are brand new to SSIS, or you’ve been using it for a while, it’s likely you’ve had some questions about the Data Flow. Why are some components so much slower than others? Why can’t I store a value (like a row count) in one component, and use it in another component later in the Data Flow? And why does it always seem to be the part of my package that fails when I run it against real data? Well, you’re not alone. During this session, we’ll answer these questions (and many others) by learning how the Data Flow operates internally. After attending this session, you’ll know a lot more about getting the most out of Data Flows in SSIS.

## Title: Data Warehouse ETL with Integration Services
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft designed Integration Services with ETL processing for Data Warehouses in mind, so loading one should be pretty easy. It's not that bad, but there are a few things you should avoid and non-obvious best practices to use to make that ETL faster and more reliable. This session will explain how to accomplish Kimball style ETL using SQL Server Integration Services. We'll review the SCD Wizard and how it works for processing your dimension tables - and what alternatives you have to it. We'll also examine fact table loading using a surrogate key replacement pipeline. Finally, we’ll look at specific and easy performance tweaks, techniques and best practices that apply directly to DW loads.

## Title: Through the Looking-Glass
 
**Abstract**:
"Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There" - When your world is SQL Server, you need a looking-glass to determine server health, diagnosis problems, and tune performance.  In this session will we follow Alice through the looking-glass to determine what she finds in SQLServerLand.  Alice will be using dynamic management views and functions (DMVs) to explore the land behind the looking-glass.  She will find statistics, poorly performing queries, and much more.  Follow Alice and her new friends, as she traverses across SQLServerLand and provides you with snippets of T-SQL code that you can use to explore your own SQLServerLand.

## Title: Is That A Failover Cluster On Your Laptop?
 
**Abstract**:
ver the years, one of the most common questions I am asked is, "How can I configure a cluster on my machine?" Ask no more! Production should never be the only place you have clusters. Having the ability to create a cluster that you can use as a sandbox for testing or as an instruction tool for presentations and demonstrations is something every DBA should have in their arsenal.This session will demystify the "magic" behind configuring a cluster on your laptop or desktop using either Vmware Workstation or Microsoft's Hyper-V in Windows Server 2008 R2, and show how to configure things like the virtual machines, the domain controller, and the iSCSI storage solution.

## Title: Attribute Discretization in Analysis Services (BI)
 
**Abstract**:
Attribute discretization is an oft-overlooked feature in Analysis Services that allows us to automatically create a manageable number of groups of attribute values that are clearly separated by boundaries. Discretization can help us to make it easier for information consumers to work with large numbers of possible attribute member values. In this session, we will discuss the varied options, the design (and other) considerations involved, and best practices surrounding the use of this capability.

## Title: Virtualization and SAN Basics for DBAs
 
**Abstract**:
These two technologies can make a very big – and very bad – difference in how your SQL Server performs. Wouldn’t it be great if you could get the real, honest lowdown from a virtualization administrator, a SAN administrator, and a DBA? Wouldn’t it be even better if one person had done all three, and could give you the pros and cons of each point of view? That person is Brent Ozar, a Microsoft Certified Master who’s been there and done that.

## Title: Become a Bilingual DBA! Oracle for the SQL Server 
 
**Abstract**:
In today's enterprise environments, it is becoming increasingly necessary to integrate data from a variety of sources. As SQL Server continues its march into the enterprise, the days of focusing 100% on one platform are over. At a bare minimum, we need to be able to communicate with DBA's for other platforms. Terminology as simple as Instance and Database mean very different things in Oracle than they do in SQL Server. In this session, we will compare and contrast the two platforms in terms of features and terminology. We will also discuss some of the best practices and pitfalls when integrating the two.

## Title: No More Bad Dates: Using Temporal Data Wisely
 
**Abstract**:
Temporal data can be confusing in SQL Server. It's no wonder: there are six data types for storing these values. In this session we'll discuss dates, times, and how they are stored internally. We'll talk about how to select a temporal data type and common issues with some types. We'll compare performance of different methods for computing temporal values. We'll also take a look at gotchas in features of SQL Server for which date and time data type choices can be critical. Choose wisely: the correct type and high performing data access logic will help your applications scale and save development and administrative time.
