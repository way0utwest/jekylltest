## Title: Big Data for the SQL Server DBA w/Kevin Cox-Part 1
 
**Abstract**:
If you’re like most Database Administrators then you already work with data that is big, so what is this big data thing all about?  This session will cover the significance of big data by comparing and contrasting it to the SQL Server relational database environment.  It will also demonstrate the value a big data ecosystem can provide to your technology infrastructure organization by using it to complement your existing data architecture, and by having it co-exist in effective ways with your SQL Server databases. Live demonstrations will show how you to get maximum value out of big data with tools such as Sqoop, Hive and Pig so that you can perform bulk data transfers, queries, and ETL using SQL Server and HDFS, the Hadoop file system.

## Title: "What is the Best Disaster Recovery Solution?"
 
**Abstract**:
It depends, every situation is different. The question is often asked of DBA's to provide a solution to very open ended requirements.  However, the best solution can only be provided if the database professional is getting all the answers.  This session is a case study into many of Disaster Recovery options that we as database professionals have.  Understand the answers to the important questions that  we should be asking to provide the best solution not only for the database but for the business as well.  As an attendee you will learn how to change an answer from it depends into a solid solution that can be built upon. We will take examples from experiences and as a group determine what the best solution is.

## Title: T-SQL Brush-up: The Best Things You Forgot
 
**Abstract**:
You’re a good SQL professional – you attend conferences and webinars, you read articles and books, and you know your way around SQL Server. But sometimes – just SOMEtimes – some piece of T-SQL slips by you unnoticed, or falls out of memory. Most of us are working with at least two or three out of the last five versions of SQL Server, so who can blame us for missing a feature or two? Come and revisit old favorites, and brush up on new T-SQL features and enhancements. In this session you will see SELECT turned inside-out. You’ll get really, really excited about OVER and PARTITION BY. You’ll learn that Common Table Expressions are, in fact, very cool. This session is chock full of code examples, including before-and-after demos and how-tos.

## Title: Oracle for the SQL Server DBA
 
**Abstract**:
Well known RDBMS’ have similar physical designs to meet ACID requirements and production standards.  As most DBA’s are required to support more than one platform these days, this presentation will introduce the SQL Server DBA to the fundamental concepts of Oracle database administration.

The attendee will leave this session with a solid understanding of the similarities and differences in comparison to common Oracle features, design basics and how they correspond to SQL Server architecture. 

 
Prerequisites:  An open mind to different database platforms and a solid understanding of SQL Server.  No exposure to Oracle database administration is required to attend this presentation.

## Title: The Backup Tune-Up
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever gotten tired of your 1TB database taking 4+ hrs to backup? Are you sick of having your users breathe down your neck for 2hrs because it’s taking too long to restore a DB? Well now you don’t have to worry about that anymore. I’m going to show you some little known tricks, methods, and trace flags you can use to tune your backups just like you would a query. Backups actually have kind of an execution plan that you can access if you know how, and knowing how to get the individual portions of your backup process down will allow you to knock 80% and even more off of your backup and restore time. I’m not holding anything back in this session. This is a method I’ve used for 15yrs to tune my backups and I’ve had great success.

## Title: The Accidental Programmer
 
**Abstract**:
Most people in the database world have heard of the term, "The Accidental DBA", those programmers who out of nowhere get thrown into working with databases. Well what about the other side of the coin? What about those DB Developers and DBA's who have to write code? This presentation is a best practices guide for working with SQL Server in a .Net environment. You will learn how to recognize when bad code is written that interacts with the database, how to track it down, and most importantly how to fix it. On top of that you will also receive an introduction to object oriented programming concepts such as data abstraction, encapsulation, tier architecture, and class objects so that you can better communicate with your programmers.
