## Title: Essentials of a Business Intelligence Architecture
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server allows you to construct an analytic organization by creating a bona fide Business Intelligence foundation, giving you more insight into the status of the business, powerful ad-hoc reporting capabilities, dynamic analytical capabilities, and forecasts that make your psychic jealous.  It's an understatement to say this requires really good data and terrific data structures.  In this session, Carlos Bossy will discuss how to use SSIS to implement integration, metadata and transformations,  SSAS for ad-hoc and predictive analytics, and SSRS to provide users the ability to develop their own reports.  You will leave this session with a firm grasp to building a robust data architecture that achieves successful Business Intelligence.

## Title: The importance of data strategy
 
**Abstract**:
Data is not a by-product of a new wiz-bang application.  Databases are not just a container for the shiny new website.  Databases do not exist simply to be managed.  Data is the reason for creating the applications and the IT infrastructure to support it.
According to TDWI poor data quality costs businesses in excess of $6 billion per year.  The cost of good data existing in multiple systems and business processes to work around or with poor or multiple copies of the same data is likely much higher.
This session will address the data in your environment instead of the container that it lives in.  We will look at Master Data Services in SQL Server 2008 R2 and how it can help your organization rethink and help define your data strategy.

## Title: Extended Events, Work Smarter Not Harder 
 
**Abstract**:
Often, as DBAs, we are presented with the prospect of resolving performance issues. Consider when Bob the Developer shows up accusing the server of inadequacies and expecting resolution. After hours digging through log files and traces and you are able to identify code that Bob deployed that was the root of the problem. What if there was a way to do this type of performance tuning before Bob the Developer shows up and before Sue the User figures out there are performance issues? In this session we’ll take a look at Extended Events and how you can leverage it in every day scenarios. We’ll discuss the ins and outs of how to get detailed information on the errors and events that occur within SQL Server and how to understand the information.

## Title: So... You've Inherited "The DB From Heck"
 
**Abstract**:
It's nice when, as database developers, we have a clean slate to work with. Most of the time, however, we inherit and must support existing designs and implementations. To add to the challenge, more often than not documentation of the database doesn't exist or is out-of-date with respect to the production system.

In this session, we'll look at some tools, techniques, and scripts that will accelerate your understanding of that beast you're now in charge of supporting and extending.

## Title: Getting Started With SQL Azure
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Azure is Microsoft's solution for hosting basic SQL Server relational databases in the cloud. Microsoft continues to add new features in each Azure Service Update that makes SQL Azure a more viable solution. For smaller databases that don't require features such as Reporting Services, Analysis Services, or Full Text Search, it can be an easy to use technology that can save lots of money in hardware, license and maintenance costs. This session shows you how to configure, connect to, and manage a SQL Azure database, both from SQL Server Management Studio and from a .NET application, and it gives best practices and tips on how to get the most benefit from SQL Azure.

## Title: Why I Use Stored Procedures
 
**Abstract**:
With the proliferation of ORM tools like Entity Framework, nHibernate, and Linq to SQL, many projects have decided that stored procedures are not needed and slow down development.  While these tools have their place and have improved greatly, stored procedures still have their place, and, in this speaker's opinion, are the best way to do data access.  In this session I'll discuss my reasons for using stored procedures and hopefully stimulate some discussion of other access methods.
