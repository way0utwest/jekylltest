## Title: What is CI/CD for databases or how to automate DB changes
 
**Abstract**:
In the world of agile software development, the database development process introduces some challenges to the application development process. The delivery of changes at database level tends to be a different and separated process of the application delivery process or even an entirely manual process. This contributes to the perspective that the database is a bottleneck in the agile process.
In this session, I will show how to build a deployment pipeline capable of delivering database and application changes. The pipeline includes the following steps: source control, continuous integration and continuous delivery. I will share methods and strategies that allow bringing together databases and applications in the delivery process reducing the delivery pain. 
The main goal is to understand that applications and databases can and should share the same deployment pipeline and that this pipeline will allow you not be afraid of making database changes.

## Title: Don't Bite Off More Than You Can Chew - Take It in Chunks
 
**Abstract**:
Any SQL programmer with some experience knows that loops are bad and that you should work with all data at once in set-based statements. However, you may have experienced situations where this strategy did not work out well and you ran into problems like out-growing the transaction log or blocking other users.

You can solve this by operating on the data in chunks. Implementing chunking is not that difficult, but there are still pitfalls you can run into. In this session, I will discuss in what situations you may want to use chunking. I will give some best practices for how to implement chunking for good performance and I will highlight some things you need keep in mind, for instance, recovering from interruptions. 

I will also look at how you can use chunking for error handling: You want process many rows and you want the good rows to succeed even if some rows yield errors – something you cannot do in a single set-based statement.

## Title: Architecture of modern data warehouse
 
**Abstract**:
The modern DWH brings together all kinds of data, at any scale, without much effort and time, to get insight through operational reports, analytical dashboards, and advanced analytics for all users.
Microsoft Azure provides a set of fully managed services, which allow you to build modern DWH in a few minutes. All Azure services support a fully cloud based solution, or a mix of cloud and on-premise based solutions, to meet the business need. A modern Data Warehouse can be designed to meet business need and accommodate change in data behavior using the latest technology components such as cloud based scalable data storage for big data, real time analytics, predictive analysis and machine learning, global distribution of data, high availability, etc.

## Title: Don't Use Cursors or Why You Maybe Should Use a Cursor After All
 
**Abstract**:
You might have heard "don't use cursors, they are slow!". In this presentation, you will learn what it actually means: you should normally write set-based statements instead and I will explain why they generally are faster than writing your own loops. But I will also look at situations where using a loop for one reason or another is preferable, and you will learn that the best way to run a loop in most cases is exactly a cursor, provided that you implement it properly. The presentation also gives some tips how you can troubleshoot performance problems with loops.

## Title: SQL database on IoT devices, could you? should you? would you?
 
**Abstract**:
The current IoT devices are pretty powerful, so could very well run a version of SQL engine.
It would be a good idea?  What will be the use of it? How to make it work and make the most of it? 
How does all fit with the field gateway concept?  During the presentation, we will take a real word scenario, real hardware, and together we will try to answer these questions

## Title: SQL Server Columnstore Indexes: Practical recipes
 
**Abstract**:
Columnstore is a special type of index first introduced in SQL Server 2012 and greatly improved in SQL Server 2016/2017. It's a column-based index geared toward increasing query performance for workloads that involve large amounts of data, typically found in data warehouse fact tables.

In this session, we will look at several tips how to improve performance of our work scenarios with using columnstore indexes. Also will discover in this session how to make incredible magics with data storage.

## Title: Hidden gems of SQL Server 2017
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2017 is full of new features and improvements. The main "Killer" feature of SQL Server 2017 is SQL Server on Linux, but there are some more big and interesting features: Adaptive Query Processing, Graph Processing, Automatic Tuning and many others which you are aware of. And in this session we will not talk  about them. We will not do that just because there are a lot of cool features in SQL Server 2017, which are more hidden from our sight and have not get enough attention. 

In this session, we will learn a lot about these features and improvements. Which features? This is a secret :) Come to the session and discover them with me!
