**Title**: PowerShell Awesomesauce
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will begin exploring the amazing world of the PowerShell language.  We will compare cmdlets/operations to similar syntax/patterns in the T-SQL language.  We'll also step through one of the most talked about topics (the foreach-object command).  PowerShell has been bragged about since the beginning because of how much you can accomplish in just one line of code.  When you leave this session YOU will be bragging about what YOU can do in just ONE line of code!

**Title**: Delivering BI Solutions Rapidly using Vulcan
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server, Integration Services, and Analysis Services are used together to deliver BI solutions but development efforts are carried out separately, without sharing of metadata between the products. This creates duplicate effort and compromises the ability to develop agile, iterative solutions.  Vulcan is an open source project from Microsoft (http://vulcan.codeplex.code) that helps bridge this gap, while also providing many of the benefits of code focused approaches used in application development. It allows you to define the relational data marts, ETL, and OLAP cube portions of your BI solution in a common language, and seamlessly uses that information to generate the appropriate database schemas, SSIS packages, and SSAS cubes.

**Title**: SSIS, You, and ETL Architecture
 
**Abstract**:
BOS30-200: SSIS, You , and Better ETLDid you already learned SSIS, and now want to get serious about ETL? Did you become an SSIS developer by accident, but wonder what makes a good ETL solution? Is your current SSIS solution falling apart and you need to revamp it? The Complexity and importance of Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) projects are often underestimated, and the consequences of a poor crafted solution would inevitable lead to maintenance nightmares, or worse yet to the failure of the whole project. In this session we will try to bridge SSIS and a ETL architecture based on good practices while looking to some lessons learned from real world implementations.

**Title**: SQL Server Service Broker in the Real World
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008 include a fantastic feature that few people understand or use.  That feature is the Microsoft SQL Server Service Broker.  The SQL Service Broker is one of the least used features within the database engine, and that lack of use is simply from last of knowledge about the feature.

In this session we’ll dig into how to configure the service broker for not only intra-database message queuing, but database to database queuing as well as server to server database queuing.  We will also dig into a real life scenario where the SQL Server Service Broker was used to do ETL from an OLTP database to an OLAP database in near real time for near real time reporting.

**Title**: Tips For The Lazy But Driven DBA
 
**Abstract**:
Having had to support a large number of SQL Server instances as a solo DBA for many years I’ve developed a toolbox of scripts and arsenal of processes that I rely upon to give insight into disk space, file growth, backup status, Agent job outcomes, and login management.  Some of these I’ve shared on various websites and blogs; others see the light of day for the first time in this session.  Attendees leave the session with processes and code they can begin to use immediately.

**Title**: Automate SQL Server Administration with PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
Most administrative functions consist of repetitive sequences of tasks which just take time.  PowerShell is a powerful scripting environment which allows an administrator to automate those repetitive tasks, providing better results to the organization while saving the administrator time, and ensuring that the tasks get done properly every time.  This session will give an introduction to PowerShell and demonstrate a number of scripts which help SQL Server administrators effectively manage their environments.

**Title**: SQL Server Performance Related DMVs
 
**Abstract**:
There are number of tools available on the market for the SQL Server performance troubleshooting. But do we use the full power of the internal SQL Server Data Management Views (DMVs)? Some very challenging issues can be solved using DMVs. What the Dynamic Management Views are? How diagnostics data is getting populated? Using the examples we are going to talk about diagnostic data analysis using T-SQL queries against SQL Server DMVs.

**Title**: Gather SQL Server Performance Data with PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
We all know how important it is to keep a baseline of performance metrics that allow us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  We don't always know how to do this easily and consistently.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.
