##Title: Revenge: The SQL! - Director's Cut##
 
**Abstract**:
Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.

##Title: A deep dive into SQL Server Plan Cache Management##
 
**Abstract**:
As an experienced DBA you have probably asked yourself questions like how the memory is consumed, is my system well-tuned, and is my memory configuration well defined. In order to understanding such processes as local and global Memory pressure, caches concurrency, adding and removing plans from cache we will go through the internal organization of the plan cache, the metadata available, how SQL Server finds a plan in cache, plan cache sizing, and the plan eviction policy. We will point out the important cache consumers that affect your workload and how to get metadata about them, what are the thresholds in Cache Size Management. At the end you will understand how to monitor the memory consumers in your SQL Server, what are wait types that we need to look for, how to understand if your system is well-tuned and the memory configuration is well defined. You will have a clear understanding of cache plan problems and how to avoid them.

##Title: End to end risk assessment – affordable solution using Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
Risk assessment is becoming an integral part of many organizations. In order to do it successfully you need to do it regularly and consistently. You need to register the risk factors, the risks them self, evaluate them and then plan the actions required to mitigate them. Besides the registration you need to have compelling and easy reading reports that help managers quickly find how the assessment is going. The familiar Excel interface helps assessors register the risk factors and risks and then plan the actions. The solutions then uses Power Query to load data into PowerPivot without overwriting and the Power View to report the results. The results can then be monitored in Power BI. 

This method can easily transfer to any other data collection solution such as budgeting or incident registration

##Title: The Data Loading Performance Presentation##
 
**Abstract**:
Loading huge amounts of data into SQL Server can be a challenging task. When doing it, there are quite a few factors that can help or hurt you.

For that, Microsoft has published a famous whitepaper called "The Data Loading Performance Guide".
The problem is that it's long and full of small details, and we're too lazy to read it.

On this session, we will turn the whitepaper into a presentation and talk about the ways you can optimize your massive data loading processes by applying the techniques mentioned in the whitepaper, as well as other advanced techniques that have emerged since the whitepaper was published.

Among other topics, we will talk about the #1 enemy of high performance data loading, Minimal Logging and Bulk Load, indexing techniques, properly leveraging parallelism and partitioning, SQL Server 2014 Delayed Durability, and more.

##Title: SSRS Inception: Reporting on Reporting services.##
 
**Abstract**:
Still using Reporting Services? Yeah me too! Does this scenario sound familiar? You already have a large SSRS environment but the users still want more reports. You create a new, all singing, all dancing dashboard that removes the need for a bunch of reports, awesome. You launch it and explain to the business  that you are deprecating the old reports. "WAIT! We still need that for Jill in HR to do her end-of-month", or "We might still need that" - these types of comments are what leads to having a load of reports that are not being used.  
 
Wouldn't it be great if you could see who is viewing a report, in what format and how often, all inside your current SSRS environment? With this data wouldn't it then be even better if we could automate a process to email the owner of that report to say "HA! I told you no one looked at this report!". In this session we will look at how we can do all of this and more by mining the SSRS DB.

##Title: SQL Server Magic Buttons: What are Trace Flags, and why should I care?##
 
**Abstract**:
You have probably heard about SQL Server Trace Flags, but there are so many of them! Do you really need them? Is it safe to use them? What are they for? Is it worth spending time researching them and documenting them online? That's what I did anyway.

In this session you will get a good overview of what Trace Flags can do for you, the risks and benefits, and how you should approach bringing them in to your production environment. Then of course there will be a deep dive in to some of the most useful and interesting ones. Since there is a lot more information to this subject than can be covered in one hour, there will be an extensive list of online resources included.

##Title: Data modeling for data analysis and cubes##
 
**Abstract**:
Analysis Services OLAP cubes provide an incredibly powerful platform for the analysis and reporting of complex data. Unfortunately we often find that our source data is not in the right structure to make the best use of the cube’s power. This limits the cube’s functionality, compromises performance and complicates the reports.
In this session we’ll look at a number of different data scenarios that we encounter and explore ways of remodelling the data within the data warehouse to optimize it for cubes and MDX. We’ll see how adding functionality into the ETL layer and data warehouse can have a dramatic effect on the functionality and simplicity of the cube.

##Title: Azure Machine Learning, notes from the field##
 
**Abstract**:
Machine learning makes it possible to analyse large amounts of data, and it opens the doors to new insight, operational efficiency, direct marketing and the ability to make qualified decisions about the future. The machine learning technology has been known for years, and now it's finally available, and easy to use, for everyone.
 
Come to my session to get an overview of the possibilities Azure Machine Learning enables, and to learn from some of the experience I've obtained working with different machine learning projects. As this is an intermediate session, we will be looking closer at some of the machine learning algorithms.

##Title: Taming the Beast – How a SQL DBA can keep Kerberos under control##

What should be a straight forward and simple process can lead to all sorts of issues and trying to resolve them can turn into a nightmare.

##Title: Performance tuning a PowerPivot and Tabular model, notes from the field##
 
**Abstract**:
In-memory means blazingly fast, at least most of the time. 
But modeling for the xVelocity/Vertipaq engine is a completely different beast than modeling for your trusty multi-dimensional SSAS cubes.

Join me on a session of improving a malfunctioning PowerBI Excel sheet and pick up handy tips and tricks you will need to tune your xVelocity models.

##Title: Responding to extended events in near real time##
 
**Abstract**:
Extended events are really useful for gathering information not available otherwise. However, compared to other technologies such as trace and event notifications, it seems to be lacking a way to react to the events as soon as they happen. In this session we will see how this is possible using the APIs and which new possibilities this approach enables.

##Title: INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE - deep dive##
 
**Abstract**:
DML is used in  most cases without thinking about the multiple operations for the db engine. This session will give a deep dive into the internal storage engine down to record level.After finishing the theory (and inside the theory) the differen DML commands and their tremendous operational tasks for the db engine will be investigated.SEE, what a workload will be caused by a "forwarded record". What tremendous workload will occur in a page split. What happens if an existing record will be updated in fixed length attributes

##Title: Automating the testing of your BI solutions with NBi##
 
**Abstract**:
If you want to accelerate the testing of your BI solutions, the best strategy is the automation of your tests with the help of a dedicated framework. During this session, we’ll take a look to the features of the open-source framework named “NBi” (nbi.codeplex.com). This framework is providing support for automated tests on the fields of databases, cubes, reports and ETLs, without the need of .Net skills. The demos will show us the best approaches to quickly and effectively assert the quality of BI developments. We'll go a step further, generating the tests by an interesting system of templates and test-cases sources.

##Title: Stories from the Trenches: Upgrading SQL with Minimal Downtime##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server has come a long way in the last few years, with Microsoft investing heavily in High Availability features. This session will show you how to use these features to enable you to safely upgrade a SQL Server, while ensuring you have a return path if things should go wrong. You will leave the session knowing what features you can use to upgrade either the OS, Hardware or SQL Server version while keeping your maintenance window to a minimum. The session will apply to Standard Edition as well as Enterprise Edition, so doesn't only apply to "High Rollers"!

We examine the common issues such as full transaction log, how to get rid of multiple log files and shrink the log file, and solve the log fragmentation problem. Also we take a glance at new features of SQL Server 2014 for transaction log management.

##Title: Efficient Indexing Strategies##
 
**Abstract**:
Indexes are incredibly powerful objects to optimize your database performance. However, when not implemented optimally, indexes can also have a negative impact on your queries! In this session we will take a close look at the different index types, how they work and how we can use that knowledge to design an efficient indexing strategy for your databases. We will also spend time analyzing existing indexes. Are those indexes being used? Can we combine indexes? Those are some of the questions you will learn to answer in this session.
