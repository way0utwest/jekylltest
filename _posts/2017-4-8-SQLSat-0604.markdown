##Title: Automated Restore Script Output for Ola Hallengren’s Maintenance Solution##
 
**Abstract**:
This session is designed to be useful to two different audiences:
1.Those implementing Ola Hallengren’s Maintenance Solution for the first time. (Or don't even know what the Maintenance Solution is!)
2.Those that have been using it for awhile, but might have a hole in their DR plan – what to restore when a resource goes offline.

We will do an overview of the maintenance solution to start, then get down and dirty with the guts of the extension. What I am presenting is a custom extension that works out of the box for jobs created using the maintenance solution. The scripts will add an additional job step to all DatabaseBackup jobs which will output a text file that contains the most current restore scripts for each database in the instance.
If you don't know what I just described in that last paragraph, you should come to this session and that will be explained as well!

##Title: Get Your Optimizer to Give up All Its Secrets##
 
**Abstract**:
You know that execution plans can provide you with vital information to tune a query, but just how does that plan get generated?  In this session, we will examine details the query optimization process that are not very well known.  We will discuss how SQL Server parses a T-SQL statement then and begins applying rules to make it more efficient.  Did you know that SQL Server can be coaxed into outputting hidden structures such as parse trees and memos?  We#39;ll do just that, and then take it a step further with a unique visualization tool that I have created.  With a better understanding of how SQL Server optimizes T-SQL (and sometimes doesn#39;t do it as well as might be hoped), you can write more efficient SQL statements.

##Title: Statistics  Cardinality – How They Work to Find Data Efficiently##
 
**Abstract**:
Are your statistics up to date? 
Yes, it’s that dreaded phrase you hear all the time when it comes to performance tuning your SQL Server. What does it matter? Why should I care about statistics? Aren’t they automatic or something like that?
In this session we will go over why statistics matter, how they are generated, how they impact performance, and even how to maintain them. Once we have that all settled, we will take a quick look at how the cardinality estimator uses statistics to determine a ‘good enough’ plan to use. We will close out the session by taking a look at the performance impact from a simple upgrade of your SQL Server to 2014 and using the new cardinality estimator.

##Title: SQL Server Infrastructure – Cloud and On-Prem Options##
 
**Abstract**:
Years ago, DBAs worked side-by-side with the infrastructure teams who managed the equipment their databases ran on. Today, organizations are more siloed than ever, and DBAs have less visibility into this layer than ever before. What is actually under the OS? Why does it matter? 

Physical servers, enterprise virtualization, and cloud servers all provide solid platforms for you to run your databases on, but improperly configured and tuned platforms can lead to performance nightmares. Let’s explore the various layers, options, and performance characteristics of the different systems underneath SQL Server so you can improve the performance of your systems.

##Title: Deconstructing Deceptively Simple DAX##
 
**Abstract**:
DAX is the cornerstone for providing calculations within the SSAS Tabular Model, Power Pivot and Power BI. In this presentation, we will take a deeper look into some common DAX calculations and why they can be deceptively simple.  I’ll show how subtle differences in DAX expressions can have a significant impact on the results. I’ll share my experience working with DAX to help give you an important understanding of how DAX expressions are evaluated.  Knowing these concepts will enable you to leverage and use the intricate capabilities in the DAX language and get the results you expect.  This presentation assumes that you have some experience with DAX.

##Title: Relational Data Architecture 101##
 
**Abstract**:
This presentation is a quick introduction for the DBA or developer who was just told that their boss promised a major new customer a scalable, well designed database. The customer will pay a lot of cash and years of ongoing business using this database… If you deliver it this week!

You’ll get a big bonus if you build this right, but you also remember what your co-workers did to the person who bungled the last database design… and wonder if that designer ever recovered! This session will introduce you to the fundamentals of Datatypes, Relational Algebra, and Normalization to help you avoid the major pitfalls and maybe get some sleep too!

This presentation is a survey of Data Architecture for the Intermediate DBA, it is not intended for experienced Data Modelers.

##Title: Inside the SQLPS PowerShell Module##
 
**Abstract**:
SQLPS has been evolving since 2012 and the SQL Provider/cmdlets have been around since 2008. Have you taken advantage of the PowerShell infrastructure that is on your servers? This session takes you behind the scenes of the SQLPS module that is installed with the tools. We will cover how to get it without the tools, how to use it once you have it and why you will want to use it for simple tasks or complex ones. When you learn how to navigate SQL Server and all its services using Paths, you won't go back. Join me for a fun filled hour and learn how to keep SQLPS from becoming frustrating and a black box. You will be glad you did. Let's continue the journey to becoming a PowerShell DBA.

##Title: Database Snapshots - Making Your Job Easier##
 
**Abstract**:
Want to off load some of that reporting workload, make an emergency rollback during a production upgrade faster, or make managing your test databases easier?  If any of these appeal to you, then you should be familiar with database snapshots within SQL Server.  Available since SQL Server 2005, use of this feature can make your life a lot easier.We'll spend the first part of this session taking an in depth look at how database snapshots work. We’ll look at what exactly is happening behind the scenes when you create a snapshot and when you query a snapshot.  Once we've covered the basics, we'll spend the rest of our time analyzing and discussing a number of real world use cases where snapshots can be very beneficial and save you a great deal of time.

##Title: Partitioning Basics: Treating Your Tables Like Legos##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have tables and indexes that have grown really large? Are you moving around a lot more data than you used to? Are your windows for jobs and maintenance getting tighter? If you answered yes to any of these questions, partitioning may be for you!

With partitioning, you can break a table or index down into smaller more manageable chunks. It can help you perform maintenance on just part of a table or index. You can even move data in and out of tables with quick and easy metadata only operations. We’ll go over basic partitioning concepts such as horizontal vs. vertical partitioning, and techniques like partitioned views and full blown table partitioning. We’ll  also look at how partitioning affects things under the hood. Finally you'll see some cool demos/tricks around index maintenance and data movement. At the end of this session you’ll have a firm understanding of how partitioning works and know how to make decisions on how and when to implement.

##Title: Revenge: The SQL!##
 
**Abstract**:
Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.

##Title: XML vs JSON - Battle Royale##
 
**Abstract**:
Shiny new touch bar MacBook Pro under one arm, JSON strolls in with a coffee from that new place with the ethically sourced beans. Grizzled XML looks up from an old ThinkPad and grunts, remembering that the stained company mug on the cluttered desk had been empty for some time. JSON was sure to be assigned the new web features while XML would be spending another week on those legacy third party integrations...

SQL Server 2016 brings JSON support, but does that mean XML is old news? Which has more features? Do they matter? Which is faster?

We'll review the many similarities and highlight some important differences between SQL Server 2016's XML and JSON support. You'll leave equipped to make the right choice for your environment.

##Title: Extending Applications Securely Using Service Broker##
 
**Abstract**:
If you’ve ever tried to build a distributed application - one that spans multiple servers or even multiple sites - you know how complex it can be. Web services are a common approach to that problem, but they aren’t the right solution to every problem. SQL Server professionals have another option. Service Broker is designed to run in a distributed architecture, and it has strong built-in security to protect the data as it is being transferred between systems. As an added bonus, Service Broker can also be extended to interact directly with a Windows service, providing a bridge to web services or even Azure. I’ll demonstrate how to implement all of these advanced configurations using concrete, real-world examples in this session.

##Title: SQL Server 2016 SP1 ROCKS!!##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2016 SP1 is probably one of the top 3 announcements for SQL Server ... EVER!! Many previously Enterprise Edition only features were opened up to lower SKUs, including SQL Express! Memory usage scenarios changed DRASTICALLY too! This session will be a medium-to-high-level overview of these absolutely incredible changes.  If you are like most entities and NOT on SQL Server Enterprise Edition you WILL want to be on SQL Server 2016 SP1 after hearing this talk!

##Title: Power BI - The One Power Tool to Rule Them All?##
 
**Abstract**:
There have been a lot of Power this and Power that tools over the years from Microsoft.  So many different tools, versions, methods of sharing to keep track.  A lot of the functionality of those various different tools have been poured into Power BI.  Doing this has made it a fairly easy transition from one toolset to another.  In this session we'll do some hands on learning of building and sharing of visually stunning reports and dashboards.  Perhaps at the end of the session you'll be calling Power BI your precious?  No?  Maybe not, but we'll have fun learning the capabilities of BI tool that is constantly getting better.

##Title: Index 360 - Looking at Indexes from Multiple Perspectives##
 
**Abstract**:
If you have used a database, chances are almost certain you've utilized indexes as well. In this presentation, I will discuss why indexes are important to anyone that interacts with a database, covering what they are, how they are utilized, how best to take advantage of them, and even when they can be problematic. It is my intention that this presentation help anyone become more comfortable with indexes and understand what they can do for you and your role, be it a DBA, Developer, or BI Professional.

##Title: Understanding and Handling Database Corruption##
 
**Abstract**:
Database corruption is simply a fact of a DBA's life - if you haven't seen it yet, you will. Success or failure depends on having a solid plan to deal with different types of corruption. In this session, we will discuss usage of related DBCC commands such as DBINFO, CHECKDB and PAGE. You'll learn how to monitor for corruption with SQL Agent Alerts and Jobs, and when it's time to restore instead of repair. After attending this session, you will be able to check for issues such as page corruption or data purity problems, and take the appropriate measures to deal with them.

##Title: Care and feeding of AWS RDS Instances##
 
**Abstract**:
Amazon Web Services (AWS) Relational Database Service ( RDS) offers a simple way  to set up, operate, and scale SQL Server databases  in the cloud. While deploying new managed instances is simple, there are limitations in the migration paths, tuning and maintenance tasks that any DBA can perform. In this session we will show how to use AWS CLI interface to deploy configure and maintain instances using  PowerShell  or Linux, migration paths to the AWS cloud and  learn more about the options available for  tuning AWS RDS SQL Server databases.

##Title: SQL Server Databases in the Clouds##
 
**Abstract**:
Application servers or services running on a cloud platform now have many options for their database engines. We discuss the various alternatives for providing Microsoft SQL Server services to cloud-based applications, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, and Google GCE.  Why would you choose one approach over the other? What are the trade-offs on cost, performance, availability, security, ongoing maintenance, required skill sets, etc.

##Title: Read Dirty to Me - Isolation Levels/User Impact##
 
**Abstract**:
Issue a "SELECT {data} FROM {myTable}" statement and users need to trust the data returned is accurate. What happens when multiple processes access the same data? What happens further if one of those process is an UPDATE or even a DELETE statement? How about if both processes will be updating that data? Understanding Isolation in SQL Server is paramount in ensuring data integrity in your system. We will cover the different levels of isolation and how they impact what a user views when accessing the data at a given point-in-time.

##Title: Supercharging Backups and Restores For Fun and Profit##
 
**Abstract**:
Super-fast queries are an essential part of any business process, but speed will never be more important than during a disaster when you need to restore from backup. Come and see how both backups and restores can be tuned just like a query. In this demo-intensive session, we will discuss the different phases of the backup and restore processes, how to tell how long each of them is taking, and which are the easiest to significantly speed up. You just might be surprised how simple it is to achieve dramatic results - cutting your backup and restore times by 75% or more is absolutely possible using the methods covered here.

Have you ever wanted to know how Transparent Database Encryption (TDE) works or how you set it up? What about encrypting your backups? This session will go over all the steps and caveats that go with this technology. TDE allows you to have your database encrypted on disk and the same Encryption Hierarchy allows you to back up your database and have it encrypt the contents in the backup file.  We will discuss the Encryption Hierarchy which is used for encryption in SQL Server and take you through keeping your secrets safe. Master the concepts of SQL Server Encryption when you are done with this session.

Join me to learn how to read the transaction log, how to follow a transaction as is processes, and how SQL Server handles a transaction rollback.  You will also learn how to identify the resources and objects SQL Server accesses during the course of the transaction.  Finally, you will see how SQL Server processes transactions for In-Memory tables.
