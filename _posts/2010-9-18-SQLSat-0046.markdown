## Title: Processing Flat Files with SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
When doing data integration, a common requirement is to work with flat files, whether for importing data into a system from an external source, or to export it to provide to other systems. SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) supports flat files, but there can be a number of challenges when working with them. This is particularly true if your flat files have multiple data formats contained in a single file, the data has complex formatting, or the files have inconsistent formatting. This session will help you to be more efficient when working with these types of files. You’ll learn to handle missing delimiters in the files, and parsing files that have multiple data formats. You’ll also see how to produce complex output formats.

## Title: Partitioning in SQL Server 2005/2008
 
**Abstract**:
Starting with SQL Server 2005, Microsoft has made a significant effort to truly streamline partitioning data to be on par with industry leading databases like Oracle.  The potential was not fully harnessed by the SQL Server community primarily due to the lack of any user interface associated with partitioning and due to lack of cohesive documentation. For many, Kimberly Tripp’s white paper on “Partitioned Tables and Indexes in SQL Server 2005” is generally regarded as a primary guiding source that bridges the void in MS documentation. Come and get a quick start on partitioning.  It is simple, efficient. Manageability and performance come part and parcel.

## Title: Recipe for a Happy DBA - A Guide for SQL Server De
 
**Abstract**:
In a world where separation of responsibilities becomes more and more important, the borders between DBAs and developers have grown wider than ever. For the developer seeking to employ the services of SQL Server, Interaction with one or more DBAs at certain stages of the development life cycle is nearly a given. This session discusses tips and techniques to follow that can ensure these interactions are civil, and maybe even pleasant. We will also briefly discuss features included in SQL Server 2008 R2 designed to help abstract DBA and developer division of responsibilities. This topic includes tips on TSQL scripting, deployment techniques, bad habits to avoid beginning execution plan analysis.

## Title: Identifying and Fixing Performance Problems using 
 
**Abstract**:
This session will demonstrate how SQL Server execution plans can be used to identify problems with the database design, or the TSQL code, and address those problems. The session takes the user through various common issues such as poor or missing indexes, badly written code and generally bad query performance, demonstrating how to identify the issues involved using execution plans. The session will then demonstrate methods for addressing the issues and show how the fixed query's execution plans differ. Multiple methods for accessing execution plans including GUI, DMV's, and trace events are demonstrated. This lays a foundation for a general troubleshooting approach to empower the attendee to make their own queries run faster.

## Title: Patterns for SSIS Configuration and Deployment
 
**Abstract**:
Some of the most common issues encountered with SSIS are related to configuring and deploying the packages in different environments. There are a number of options for how to configure your package, and more options for how to deploy them. When you combine the available options, the possibilities can be overwhelming. During this session, we will discuss several patterns for handling configurations and deployment in SSIS. Specifically, we’ll cover two patterns for configurations – a simple pattern that can be applied to most scenarios, and a more complex pattern that provides a great deal of flexibility. We’ll also cover two methods of deploying the packages that leverage the configuration patterns.

## Title: Bad SQL
 
**Abstract**:
How do you tell good code from bad?  Bad SQL code makes the system work harder for the same results.  Bad SQL does not scale well with larger data sizes, nor does it scale with increased server activity.  Extreme Bad SQL can bring a server to a grinding halt.   This presentation shows you how and why certain commonly used SQL constructions are Bad SQL.  Bad SQL is not very useful by itself so each example includes its Good SQL counterpart.
