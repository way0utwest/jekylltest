## Title: Essentials of a Business Intelligence Architecture
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server allows you to construct an analytic organization by creating a bona fide Business Intelligence foundation, giving you more insight into the status of the business, powerful ad-hoc reporting capabilities, dynamic analytical capabilities, and forecasts that make your psychic jealous. It's an understatement to say this requires really good data and terrific data structures. In this session, Carlos Bossy will discuss how to use SSIS to implement integration, metadata and transformations, SSAS for ad-hoc and predictive analytics, and SSRS to provide users the ability to develop their own reports. You will leave this session with a firm grasp to building a robust data architecture that achieves successful Business Intelligence.
