##Title: Migrations 101##
 
**Abstract**:
The only constant thing is change. As companies continue to migrate to newer versions or different data centers, we need to develop strategies and tools to make sure we can perform successful migrations. What if we had a checklist? Just like moving to a new home the success of the "move" relies on the preparation. This presentation will go over a checklist of steps needed to prepare for a database migration.
