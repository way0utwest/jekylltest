## Title: Demystifying BISM and Tabular Mode SSAS
 
**Abstract**:
With the release of SQL 2012, Analysis Services (SSAS) has seen some major changes.  An entire new method of modelling analytic data has emerged and it's called Tabular Mode Analysis Services.  In addition to that, a new semantic layer has been added to the tool, the Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM), which will help to bring the two modes -- Multidimensional and Tabular -- into one level playing arena.

In this session, attendees will gain understanding of what Multidimensional and Tabular modelling IS, as well as how the BISM layer helps to translate user requests to ensure no confusion is made. Attendees will also learn how to BUILD a Tabular model, and will help design a solution live during the presentation.

## Title: Database Development using SQL Server Data Tools
 
**Abstract**:
In 2007, Microsoft introduced Data Dude for Visual Studio 2005 to help bring the processes, controls and tools for code management to Database Development that Application developers had been enjoying for ages.  It had its problems, but it mostly worked and was a welcome step in the right direction. Many versions later we have SQL Server Data Tools for Visual Studio 2012 (and 2010). A more mature product that finally brings database development up to par with traditional application development and has many features data geeks, like ourselves, will truly love. This talk will provide an overview of SSDT’s features and show you how to get started using it to save time, implement better code controls and be a better DBA or database developer.

## Title: Don't Box Me In:  Escape the Cubicle
 
**Abstract**:
I've been telecommuting in some capacity or another since before I was a DBA.  For 13 years I've been able to be a productive, responsive, integral and valuable asset to my company without maintaining a physical presence within the confines of a corporate office.  Let's have a conversation and discuss what has (and has not) worked for me over the years.  Let's discuss the traits of a good telecommuter as well as those attributes that may not make this the right arrangement for everyone.  We will even discuss what my Managers have done over the years to not only acommodate telecommuting, but to embrace and succeed from having staff that work remotely!  

This session is aimed at staff and management alike.

## Title: Master Data Services
 
**Abstract**:
Does your company have similar data in multiple locations? Not really sure which set of data is accurate? With MDS, Microsoft gives you the ability to have one accurate source of non-transactional data to use with your applications or send to other databases and ETL processes. Leverage data stewards to help manage the data repository to ensure it is up-to-date and accurate.

In this session we will cover MDS from start to finish including installation, creating models/entities, working with data, using the Excel 
add-in, security, hierarchies, views, versions, and business rules. After this session, you should have a good understanding of what MDS does, how to use it, and how to get started with your own MDS project.

## Title: High IO, High IO, It's a Case Study Yo Ho!
 
**Abstract**:
Confronted with the highest IO of any Windows server in our environment one intrepid DBA was able to reduce IO, space consumption, and blocking to new lows.  This is a case study, based upon actual events where the names of the innocent as well as the guilty are changed to protect the DBA.  Topics covered: DMVs, online operations, Filegroups, Page Compression, and disk formatting best practices.

## Title: Back It Up Faster!
 
**Abstract**:
Backups: You can't live without them but want them to complete as quickly as possible. The faster they're done, the sooner your server's CPU and IO resources can get back to their normal job of servicing queries. 

Queries aren't the only part of SQL Server you can tune for maximum performance - backups fall under this category as well. This session will discuss how backups work and how you can capitalize on this knowledge to ensure they complete as quickly as possible. Cutting your backup (and restore) times by 50% or more is not out of the question when using these methods.

## Title: “ColumnStore” Indexes for Fast EDW Query
 
**Abstract**:
This session will introduce the new xVelocity Memory-Optimized Columnstore Index feature of SQL 2012. This presentation will describe what a column store index is, how this feature is used to store data by columns instead of by rows and compare the advantages and disadvantages between the two storage methods. Live demos will explore how to create columnstore indexes, when to create them, best practices for using them and typical data warehouse scenarios that can leverage the columnstore index to drastically speed up data warehouse queries, in many cases by a factor of 10 to 100, so you are equipped to start implementing this feature into your database environment.

## Title: An Optimistic Approach: Snapshot Isolation in SQL 
 
**Abstract**:
Until 2005, SQL Server was a very pessimistic RDBMS.  However with the introduction of the Read Committed Snapshot database option and the new Snapshot Isolation level, that is no longer the case.

After a high level look at all SQL Server isolation levels, we’ll spend the majority of this session discussing the implementation of optimistic concurrency control in SQL Server.  We’ll look at the benefits and drawbacks of using an optimistic isolation level and discuss use cases where it may or may not be appropriate.

Come learn how to put one of the more powerful, but least understood, aspects of SQL Server to work for you!

## Title: Throwing T-SQL 2012 Enhancements Against the Wall
 
**Abstract**:
Just like your grandma tested spaghetti to tell if it was done, we'll be throwing several of the new T-SQL enhancements against the wall to see what's good and what falls off. We'll silence the lion's RaiseRror by throwing some meaty exceptions. We'll bring together the old lovers "Coalesce" and "+" for one last jaunt before they are banished by the Concat function. We'll even open the window on some of the new aggregate and analytical functions as well as some other t-sql enhancements introduced in SQL 2012.

## Title: A Powershell Driven Life
 
**Abstract**:
Why are we here?  I have no idea, but I do know Powershell can probably help make it easier.  This session will be entirely demos hitting on a variety of different areas in the SQL Server stack.  Using plenty of SQL Server Management Objects(SMO), we will cover a variety of tasks for the data professional on both sides (OLTP / OLAP) of the house including working with SSAS, SQL Server , writing tests and automation.  The theoretical will be ignored as well as any common decency towards mass produced beer.  A Powerpoint free presentation.

## Title: Navigating the Options for Data Redundancy
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server has so many options for data redundancy, how do you know when you should use replication, or log shipping or AlwaysOn, etc? We will use real world examples where data redundancy is needed and discuss which is the appropriate technology and why. This is more than just a high availability vs disaster recovery discussion. If you have ever been confused or overwhelmed by all of the options, they will be broken down and made clear in this session.

## Title: Getting Started with SSAS Tabular Cubes
 
**Abstract**:
Prior to the release of SQL Server 2012, Business Intelligence Developers had a single option when creating cubes in Analysis Services, the Multidimensional Model.  Now, Microsoft has added the Tabular Model to Analysis Services which opens up many new and exciting possibilities.

In this session, we'll discuss the features and benefits of the Tabular Model and draw comparisons to the Multidimensional Model.  We'll also review scenarios when implementing a Tabular cube may be a better choice than Multidimensional.  The presentation will conclude with a demo of basic Tabular cube functionality.

## Title: Discovering the Plan Cache
 
**Abstract**:
Execution plans are stored after execution in the plan cache. This metadata about how queries are executed can provide insight into how your SQL Server environment is functioning. By using XQuery to browse and search the plan cache you can find potential performance issues and opportunities to tune your queries. This information can be used to help reduce issues related to parallelism, shift queries from using scans to using seek operations, or discover exactly which queries are using what indexes. All of this and more is readily available through the plan cache. In this session we will explore the plan cache and start you on the road to discovery.

## Title: Extend Your Knowledge with Extended Events!
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Extended Events can be used to gather a wide range of performance information, and in troubleshooting in SQL Server.  Extended Events use less system resources and provide better information than SQL Profiler and they allow for correlation of SQL Server event data along side of OS or Application event data. This presentation will explore what Extended Events are, how to set them up and use them in several case studies.

## Title: Upgrading to SQL Server 2012 with limited downtime
 
**Abstract**:
With SQL Server 2012 released and going strong, we’re all wanting the latest and greatest, high performing, SQL Engine sitting on our servers.  How we do that is another question.  How do you get a weekend of downtime? Do you like convincing the business you need it?
I don’t and that is why we’re going to look at methods to upgrade or migrate SQL Server 2005, SQL Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 R2 up to SQL Server 2012 with as little downtime as possible - minutes.  In this session, we’ll see how mirroring, log shipping and even replication, can make us look like DBA Rock stars at upgrade time.

## Title: Unit Testing Fundamentals 
 
**Abstract**:
How can you be certain the "little change" you're about to make to that stored procedure isn't going to take down your whole company? Real developers use a technique called "Unit Testing" to minimize that risk, a concept that's also available to you. With unit testing you can quick ascertain whether the the changes to functions, stored procedures, and even other objects in your database had a negative unforeseen impact.

In this session we'll walk through the basics of what unit testing is, how to set up a simple Unit Testing project in SSMS, how we can tell whether something has negatively changed in our functions or procedures.  We'll also enumerate any 3rd party tools available to help us with Unit Testing our databases.

## Title: Manage SQL Server 2012 on Server Core w/PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
Windows Server 2008 introduced Server Core, the operating system without the Graphical User Interface. SQL Server 2012 is the first version of SQL Server to support Server Core. To gain the maximum efficiency from your servers you want to make use of Server Core and with PowerShell you can effectively manage SQL Server in that environment. This session will demonstrate how to manage SQL Server 2012 on Windows Server Core and provide scripts to help you perform the common tasks you need to perform on that platform.

## Title: SSIS Templates Can Make Your Life Easier
 
**Abstract**:
How many times have you started a new SSIS project and added the same components that you’ve added to almost every other package you’ve created?  Components to handle logging and errors or even a standard workflow for loading data files.  In this session I’ll show you how you can create standard templates that already contain any and all of the common components you desire.  We’ll also look at how to implement and use these templates so that the next time you create a SSIS package you can spend your time on the work you actually need to do instead of implementing common components over and over again.

## Title: Interrogating the Transaction Log 
 
**Abstract**:
Without the transaction log, SQL Server would have no way of maintaining a consistent and durable view of its data.  It would be pandaemonium!!!  Think of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  Thankfully the transaction log is there and we can all breathe easier.
In this session, you will learn how SQL Server uses the transaction log to maintain the durability and consistency of its data, along with methods for reading the transaction log and identifying active transactions.

## Title: Introduction to BI Markup Language (BIML) and BIML
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft has provided some great tools for creating and editing SSIS packages.  First Business Intelligence Development Studio (BIDS) then SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT).  However, when creating an SSIS package you frequently repeat the same steps over and over.  BIML is an XML markup language designed for representing the structure of an SSIS package.  BIML Script takes that structure and generates an SSIS package.
In this session we will use BIDS Helper to create a simple SSIS package using BIML.  We will handle a couple SSIS scenarios with BIML and BIML Script.

## Title: Flipping Through the SSIS Catalag
 
**Abstract**:
With the release of SQL Server 2012 one of the biggest changes for SSIS Administration was the addition of the Integration Services Catalog and using parameters. The Catalog is the storage and logging location for SSIS 2012. Parameters are the new configurations in SSIS 2012 and once you start using them you will never go back. Package Variables, Configuration Strings, Package properties can all be configured using Parameters. You will learn how to create the catalog, use parameters to deploy packages through different environments and use the built in reporting to monitor packages as they run.

## Title: Effective Index Partitioning, Compression Strategy
 
**Abstract**:
We all know that ‘Indexing’ is KING when it comes to achieving high levels of performance in SQL Server. When Indexing also combines 2 of the Enterprise features: Partitioning  Compression, we can often see substantial gains.

Learn how to identify those objects that benefit greatly from being Partitioned or Compressed, OR combining both of these features to even greater effect.

Using Demos to illustrate the performance gains with real-world examples, Take away advanced scripts for use in your own environments.

## Title: What’s Simple About SIMPLE Recovery?
 
**Abstract**:
There is a common misconception that SIMPLE Recovery means no logging, and this is a very dangerous myth to propagate. SQL Server does log database changes in SIMPLE Recovery, but some (not all) operations are minimally logged. In this presentation, I'll tell you what minimal logging means in conjunction with each of the three different recovery models. In addition, I’ll describe the benefits and dangers of the SIMPLE Recovery Model.
