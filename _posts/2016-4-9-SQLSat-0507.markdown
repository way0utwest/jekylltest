## Title: How do I create an automated ETL test suite ??
 
**Abstract**:
There are many automated test frameworks available for different types of applications, but Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) data movement applications seem to lack an efficient and easy to use automated test framework. 
We will review how to create automated tests with a data driven approach by showing how the tests self-generate based upon the data in the Information-Model schema in SQL Server and 4 slender custom tables that define the field data mapping between the source and target.
The last half of the session will be a demonstration of the tests to illustrate how they execute. To do this we will quickly review the functionality of the tSQLt test framework and the stored procedure code we created that generates the tests. We will review the considerable functionality in tSQLt that makes ETL testing and database testing easy and efficient. 
We will execute hundreds of tests in the short time during the presentation.

## Title: Performance Tuning - Analyzing Execution Plans
 
**Abstract**:
Did you ever get woken up at night from a call from a user screaming about poor query performance, but didn’t really know how to begin attack the problem?  In this session, we will explore the basics of execution plan analysis and how to single out issues that pertain to base table operations.
In this presentation, we will identify what indexes are being used by the SQL Optimizer, the different type of index operations that are performed by SQL Server and which operations are generally considered the preferred method of data retrieval. We will discuss how to determine if the indexes used by the Optimizer are optimal, according to best practices, and the exceptions to those cases.   Finally, we will cover the relationships between different types of index operations and joins within SQL Server, including how the SQL Optimizer determines which join type it will use, along with the pros and cons of each join operation

## Title: Visualization  Reporting Options on Microsoft’s Data Platform
 
**Abstract**:
A lot have changed in terms of Visualization and Reporting on the Microsoft Data Platform in the last year.  With the imminent release of SQL Server 2016 product and various Azure offerings innovating on a weekly basis, its hard to keep up with all of the options available to your organization.  Let’s step through these options and look at the strengths of each to help you make a more informed choice.  This session will be a balance of looking at the product and discussion of the offerings.  We will look at features of SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) Paginate Reports, SSRS Mobile Reports, Power BI Desktop and the Power BI Services.

## Title: SQL Server Performance Tuning Starter Kit
 
**Abstract**:
Let me take you on a fast-paced journey through basic database internals, hardware and operating system setup, and how to configure SQL Server, to avoid hearing this most painful sentence for any DBA: "the database is slow".

I talk quickly, and cover a lot of ground, but don't let that scare you.

## Title: Common Coding Mistakes and how to Mitigate them
 
**Abstract**:
Let the Big Bad Wolf huff, puff and blow your bad queries away.

There are several programming design patterns that work great in object orientated code that do not scale well inside of SQL Server.

In this session we will focus some of these patterns and show you how to make them scale in the database engine. We will touch on Scalar-Value functions, Union, CTE, RBAR and more.

After this session, you can go back to your office Monday morning and be the code tuning rock star!

## Title: backup and restore features in SQL 2012
 
**Abstract**:
Backup types in SQL Server. Importance of not having a backup strategy and instead having a restore strategy. Backup and restore examples including:
1. Full DB backup and Restore
2. Filegroup Backup and restore
3. File Backup and Restore
4. page backup and restore
5. Special case scenarios example: restoring master
6. Tips on improving performance of backups

Will try to take the audience from a beginner level to intermediate to advanced by giving examples. That way, they can get an idea on different options and ways of backing up and restoring and can use the scripts shown to practice later.

## Title: Optimizing your data warehouse for OLAP Processing
 
**Abstract**:
Analysis Services have become a major part of upper management daily decision making activities.  However, with our DW sizes reaching multiple terabytes minimizing time required to process our data has become our top priority. In this session, we will cover the options we have as DBA’s to improve the performance of our DW processing time. We will look at features and general best practices available to us within SSAS as well as enterprise level features within the database engine itself and how aligning them to work side by side would yield us at least 200% improvement in our processing time.

## Title: Migrating SQL Server Quickly and Effectively
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever had to migrate a SQL Server Instance from one server to another? Are you a 24/7 shop with a strict maintenance window? Have you ever been asked to migrate 100's of databases in a matter of minutes to keep the outage as short as possible?

In this session we will look at some techniques that can be used to migrate your SQL instances from one server to another using tools included with SQL Server. We will discuss how these strategies can be used to keep your down time requirements to a minimum and measured in minutes rather than hours.
