## Title: Scalable SSRS Reports Achieved Through the Powerful Tablix
 
**Abstract**:
Want to quickly roll out ultra-flexible reports that will wow your end users? Want to learn how to display the data in multiple layouts on the same report? Want to consolidate similar reports while still providing flexibility to your end users? This can all be achieved by leveraging the three controls based on the Tablix template: Table, Matrix, and the List control. 

In this demo-heavy session, you'll learn how to create a columnar report that grows vertically as well as horizontally. You'll see the magic of having multiple layouts for the same data on the same report. You'll see how to do more useful things with fewer reports, and you’ll come away with a bag full of new tricks to make your reports flexible and scalable works of art.

## Title: Capture Change and Apply it With Change Data Capture  SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
Whether you are trying to setup a new data warehouse, keep it updated, audit changes to your databases or quickly load changes to another database Change Data Capture (CDC) is a solution for all of these and can now be setup and supported easily with SQL Server  SSIS 2012! Change Data Capture (CDC) has been around since SQL Server 2008, but has been underused because it was difficult to fully implement. SSIS 2012 now provides support for CDC with new components that make consuming the captured data very easy to apply. This session will define what CDC is and with live demos show how it is setup on your databases. Once it has been setup then you need to consume and apply those changes, this will be demonstrated with live demos using SSIS 2012 to create packages that apply the changes.

## Title: The Life Cycle of a Query in 3D
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever wondered what really happens behind the scenes when you execute a query? In this unique demonstration, Todd will use a video game engine (Unreal Engine 4) and will dramatically show The Life Cycle of a Query in 3D. We will follow a query from beginning to end and "runthrough" the various SQL Server components all queries must use including the Protocol Layer, Relational Engine, Storage Engine, Buffer Pool and then back out to the client. A volunteer at the end will then don an Oculus Rift Virtual Reality Headset for 3D Gaming and then race through the sections in under a minute to win a prize. Participants will leave with a better understanding of the major components and with a conceptual framework to explore the components more in-depth.

## Title: Managing Oracle and Migrating to SQL Server: Tips from the Trenches
 
**Abstract**:
Part 1: Have you inherited an Oracle-based application, and are you not sure what you need to know to keep it running? Here are the basics, explained in terms familiar to Microsoft SQL administrators, including: - making sure you have, and keep, SYSDBA access - locating the ALERT log and checking for non-default PARAMETER - enabling ARCHIVELOG mode, scheduling RMAN backup, and testing restore - management of TABLESPACE and DATAFILE - using DBMS_MONITOR and TKPROF to trace SQL queries - using STATSPACK for performance troubleshooting  Part 2: Have you gotten the go-ahead to convert an Oracle database to SQL Server, and are you not sure how? Here is a proven and repeatable (and free) process, which achieves consistent results without requiring the source Oracle database to be read-only during the conversion. Microsoft's SSMA (SQL Server Migration Assistant) is just the beginning!

## Title: Improving Database Restores with Powershell
 
**Abstract**:
Database restores are a key function of any database administrator's job. However, it can be an extremely time consuming task to sort through your backups, find the right files, and then get your database up and running. In an emergency this will have a disastrous impact on your Recovery Time Objective(RTO) and lead to the dreaded angry-CTO-in-your-cube effect. By leveraging some easy-to-use Powershell scripts, you can avoid the second disaster and the pain that comes with it.   By attending this session, you will understand how you can use the Powershell automation framework for database restores, see scripts that will let you restore faster, and learn techniques to extend these tools for migrating data and testing backups.

## Title: SQL Server on VMWare Monitoring:  Optimized for Performance
 
**Abstract**:
Your SQL Server instance has been placed on a VMWare virtualized machine (VM), now what.    When a SQL Server instance moved to a virtualized architecture, the DBA typically loses visibility to CPU, Memory, Storage and network metrics.    This session will cover basic virtualization concepts specifically related to VMWare,  VMWare tools, as well as discuss specific tools to help restore the visibility of server metrics and correlate those metrics directly to SQL Server performance.   Monitoring the server metrics along with monitoring overall SQL Server performance provides for an effective solution to manage  monitor your SQL Server/VMWare virtualized environment.

## Title: An Analytics Sandbox in A World of Big Data
 
**Abstract**:
As Big Data becomes the norm to deal with data volume, variety and velocity, it becomes increasingly harder for the Data Analyst to understand and work with data sets. To overcome this we introduce Platfora, a Hadoop-backed data analysis framework which nicely complements more traditional data warehousing and BI solutions. We'll go over ingestion of new data and building of data sets and visualizations in a system that requires no more work than interacting with a graphical interface. More specifically, we will do so in the context of peer-to-peer lending, to show how insights on loan applicants and their risk profiles can be quickly revealed with no ETL development or demanding data transformation.

## Title: AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
 
**Abstract**:
In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic fail-over using a real web app to see how well this feature works.

## Title: The Curious Case of Isolation Levels
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever seen or used “WITH (NOLOCK)” in T-SQL? Do you know what it does and its side effects? Is SQL Server optimistic or pessimistic when it comes to locking? Can it be both? In this session we will cover these questions and discuss how and why SQL Server takes locks and how that affects other users. We will go over alternatives for using NOLOCK and discuss when it is appropriate to use. In addition, we will discuss what are the ACID properties and how to monitor locks and blocks.

## Title: Changing Your Habits to Improve the Performance of Your T-SQL
 
**Abstract**:
Do you dread handing your T-SQL over for code review? Do your queries run slower than you expect? Does the DBA always want to tweak your T-SQL? In this demo heavy session, we’ll take a look at various ways to improve your T-SQL. You’ll learn about formatting T-SQL for readability and why top down design is not the best solution for writing T-SQL. You’ll learn why implicit conversions slow queries down and how to leverage simple techniques for minimizing the performance impact of explicit conversions. By changing some of your T-SQL writing habits you can improve performance of queries from the very beginning.
