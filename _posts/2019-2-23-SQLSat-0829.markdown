## Title: Custom maps in Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
Let’s go beyond the standard visuals available in Power BI for making maps. In this session we won’t talk about Bing or ArcGIS services. We want to explore all the available features for creating custom maps without having to rely on existing ones. 
Do you know what is a shapefile? Do you know how to create your own choropleth and import it into Power BI? 
What else? R support into Power BI opened the doors to the huge number of packages for spatial data analysis and statistical calculations included in the environment. 
Do you want to draw multi-layered interactive maps, or perform spatial analytics?  With R in Power BI, now you can. 
Discover some custom visuals to overcome simple cartography: MapBox, IconMap, FlowMap. 
Last but not least, learn how to use Synoptic Panel, an awesome component that connects areas in a custom image with attributes in the data model and draws the data on a map. There are endless possibilities; the only limit is your imagination!

## Title: SQL Server and Continuous Integration
 
**Abstract**:
It's understandable that developers love to work in separate code branches, but this can create painful complications if not managed.

Do you dread large merge conflicts when integrating code?

Continuous Integration is a method of working where we merge and fully test our code multiple times a day. This is only possible with a high level of automation. 

I'll be discussing the tools I use to achieve this automation when developing SQL Server databases.

Finding automating the deployment of database changes hard?
SQL Change Automation is a tool that allows you to test deployments during development.

How do you know your database change won’t affect something you haven’t thought of?
tSQLt and Pester unit tests can put your mind at rest.

Having trouble keeping your test environments in sync with production?
Docker enables us to fix this with infrastructure as code

You will see how a CI approach to database development can increase team efficiency and reduce the time to go from an idea

## Title: Failure prediction for manufacturing industry with SQL Server  R
 
**Abstract**:
Working in manufacturing industry means that you must deal with product failures. As a BI and/or Data Scientist developer, your task is not only monitor and report product’s health state during its lifecycle, but also predict the likelihood of a fail in the production phase or when product has been delivered to the customer. 
Machine Learning techniques can help us to accomplish this task.  Starting from past failure data, we can build up a predictive model to forecast the likelihood for a product to fail or giving an estimate on its duration. And now it is possible to develop an end-to-end solution in SQL Server, because of the introduction of advanced analytics tools like R since release 2016. 
In this session, we start from the real case of a manufacturing company to create some predictive models: a) Regression model ; b) binary and multivariate models. 
Binary or multi-class classification problem. Some reports are also created to deliver the outcome to the stakeholders.

## Title: 8 Steps to Securing Azure Sql PaaS
 
**Abstract**:
Moving databases and workloads to the cloud has never been easier. For Sql Server there is number of products that offer almost perfect feature parity. One of the last technical challenges is right security configuration. That's because security model in the public cloud is different and requires different approach, skillset and knowledge. This session covers governance, risk management and compliance in public cloud and specifically focuses on Azure Sql PaaS resources. It provides practical examples of network topologies with their strengths and weaknesses including recommendations and best practices for hybrid and cloud-only solutions. Explains orchestration and instrumentation available in Azure like Security Center, Vulnerability Assessment, Threat Detection, Log Analytics/OMS, Data Classification, Key Vault and more. Finally shows techniques to acquire knowledge and gain advantage over attackers like deception and chaos engineering.

## Title: SQL Server Query Optimizer end-to-end
 
**Abstract**:
Execution plans are produced by the query optimizer that generates possible alternative execution plans for the same query through the use of the transformation rules. You already learned how to read an execution plan and the most significant things to look for such as warnings, most costly operators and table methods access. Now, you want to acquire a deeper understanding of how the Query Optimizer builds the optimal plan. In this session we will learn more about the phases of the optimization process, using undocumented trace flags we will discover the secrets of the Query Optimizer. Finally, we will show how to understand better the workload in terms of the percentage of time-out, the percentage of queries that contain sub-query and so on. At the end, Query Optimizer will not have any secret for you.

## Title: Il mio grosso grasso modello di Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
Le ottime prestazioni del motore di Power BI (VertiPaq), unite al suo elevato fattore di compressione dei dati, spesso rendono superflua l’attività di ottimizzazione dei modelli dati realizzati con Power BI desktop.
In realtà questa è una buona prassi che dovrebbe sempre essere prevista nel ciclo di sviluppo dei nostri modelli indipendentemente dalla loro dimensione e complessità.
In questa sessione, dopo una breve introduzione teorica sul funzionamento di VertiPaq e dei suoi algoritmi di compressione, ci concentreremo su alcune best practices da seguire per ottimizzare i nostri modelli e sugli strumenti a nostra disposizione per verificare l’effettivo livello di ottimizzazione degli stessi. Inoltre, vedremo come sia possibile raccogliere, tramite DMV, tutte le informazioni utili delle strutture dati dei nostri modelli utilizzando Power BI desktop, fino a realizzare una versione “Power BI” del famoso tool Vertipaq Analizer.

## Title: Azure Data Factory v2 with Data Flows capabilities
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft's services in Azure helps us to leverage big data more easily and even more often accessible for non-technical users. Having UI in ADF version 2 - Microsoft added a new feature: Data Flow which resembles components of SSIS. This is a very user-friendly and non-code approach tool-set.
But, has that been only UI introduction? Why and how Databricks does work under the hood?
Do you want to know this new (still in private preview) feature of ADF and reveal the power of modern big data processes without knowledge of such languages like Python or Scala?
We will review this new feature of ADFv2, do deep dive to understand the mentioned techniques, compare them to SSIS and/or T-SQL and learn how modelled data flow runs Scala behind the scenes.

## Title: From Zero to Cube in forty minutes (within a web browser)
 
**Abstract**:
L'utilizzo di Proof-of-Concept nei progetti BI è una pratica ormai molto diffusa. La possibilità di toccare con mano un prototipo navigabile in tempi stretti consente sia al cliente, sia al fornitore, di raffinare i requisiti in corso d'opera limitando il tempo speso in fase di analisi iniziale. Il Cloud rappresenta un ambiente ideale per lo sviluppo di PoC in quanto, riducendo drasticamente il tempo di provisioning delle risorse, permette agilmente di provare strade alternative valutandone il rapporto costi/benefici. In questa sessione (che è quasi una scommessa) proveremo, armati solamente di una subscription Azure e di un web browser, a tradurre in un modello navigabile dati grezzi forniti da un ipotetico cliente.

## Title: Data Overview and Manipulation – T-SQL, R, Python
 
**Abstract**:
In a real data mining or machine learning project, you spend more than half of the time on data preparation and data understanding. The R language is extremely powerful in this area. The Python language is a match. Of course, you do work with data by using T-SQL. You will learn in this session how to get data understanding with really quickly prepared basic graphs and descriptive statistics analysis. You can do advanced data preparation with many data manipulation methods available out of the box and in additional packages from R and Python. After this session, you will understand what tasks data preparation involves, and what tools you have in SQL Server suite for these tasks.

## Title: SQL Server Modernization (IT)
 
**Abstract**:
Mancano pochi mesi al termine del supporto esteso per SQL Sever 2008 e molte aziende si stanno organizzando per modernizzare i loro ambienti. Ma cosa vuol dire modernizzare? Aggiornamento, cambio di piattaforma, consolidamento, spostamento da IaaS a PaaS... quali e quanti sono gli scenari evolutivi? Quali sono i fattori bloccanti? Quali sono i fattori di rischio più comuni? Come è strutturato un progetto di migrazione/modernizzazione? Quali sono gli strumenti a supporto? A queste e altre domande cercheremo di dare risposta con questa sessione che si pone l'obiettivo sia di fornire una panoramica sull'argomento anche portando esempi concreti dal campo.

## Title: Multitenancy – from zero to it works!
 
**Abstract**:
With the evolution of the Internet in recent years, more and more services are provided online. The need to have as many installations as customers is replaced by the strategy to have a single service/product usable by different customers at the same time: this is called "multitenancy". In this session we will see why approaching this architecture and the various ways of how to implement it. At the end the "wow" effect, with a simple demo we will see that you can really do it using the ShardMapManager of Azure SQLDatabase.

## Title: Benchmarking in the Cloud
 
**Abstract**:
Lifting and shifting your application to the cloud is extremely easy, on paper. The hard truth is that the only way to know for sure how it is going to perform is to test it. Benchmarking on premises is hard enough, but benchmarking in the cloud can get really hairy because of the restrictions in PaaS environments and the lack of tooling.
Join me in this session and learn how to capture a production workload, replay it to your cloud database and compare the performance. I will introduce you to the methodology  and the tools to bring your database to the cloud without breaking a sweat.

## Title: Common Data Model, nice to meet you
 
**Abstract**:
“Data is the new oil” we heard it a lot of times. As IT professionals it’s very important to manage this fuel across our organizations, in order to properly feed “engines” in the hands of data analysts and data scientists.
Without being able to share and understand the same data easily, each application or data integration project requires a custom implementation, which can be expensive and potentially risky from a business users point of view.
Here is where the Common Data Model (CDM) comes in: we will understand CDM underlying concepts and try some hands-on integration with Microsoft Power Platform and Azure data services.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…
