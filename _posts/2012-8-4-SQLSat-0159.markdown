## Title: "What is the Best Disaster Recovery Solution?"
 
**Abstract**:
It depends, every situation is different. The question is often asked of DBA's to provide a solution to very open ended requirements.  However, the best solution can only be provided if the database professional is getting all the answers.  This session is a case study into many of Disaster Recovery options that we as database professionals have.  Understand the answers to the important questions that  we should be asking to provide the best solution not only for the database but for the business as well.  As an attendee you will learn how to change an answer from it depends into a solid solution that can be built upon. We will take examples from experiences and as a group determine what the best solution is.

## Title: Devs are from Mars, Report Servers are from Venus
 
**Abstract**:
At first, you loved working with Reporting Services, but now the honeymoon's over. What good are charts and tables when Reporting Services won't tell you what's wrong, renders too slow, and messes up your layout? You may be thinking about seeing other reporting products, but don't give up.

In this couples therapy for you and SSRS, rekindle your love by reviewing how reports perform best, seeing what RS has been trying to tell you (but you haven't been listening), and discovering new and simple tricks you never knew reports could do. You'll learn about:

• Dealing with blank extra pages 
• Designing reports for high performance 
• Powerful properties for precise layout and appearance 
• Troubleshooting using the execution log 
• ..a

## Title: So you want to be a computer consultant?
 
**Abstract**:
Consulting is a great career choice, from the increased pay, (sometimes less), to the flexible hours, (working nights and weekends), you will work with a wide range of customers, (if you can find them), that will lead you to wonder why you didn't start earlier? (and walk away from a cushy job).

I would not trade my consulting career for any other choice, I love the rewards and the freedom it provides me, but I've learned the hard way.
In this session you will lean sales, marketing and management strategies to get your practice off the ground, sand traps to avoid along the way and a honest, down to earth assessment of the consulting life. An essential session for those thinking about this choice and/or those who are just starting out.

## Title: Discovering the Plan Cache
 
**Abstract**:
Execution plans are stored after execution in the plan cache. This metadata about how queries are executed can provide insight into how your SQL Server environment is functioning. By using XQuery to browse and search the plan cache you can find potential performance issues and opportunities to tune your queries. This information can be used to help reduce issues related to parallelism, shift queries from using scans to using seek operations, or discover exactly which queries are using what indexes. All of this and more is readily available through the plan cache. In this session we will explore the plan cache and start you on the road to discovery.
