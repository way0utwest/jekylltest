##Title: In-Memory OLTP Internals for SQL Server 2014 CTP2##
 
**Abstract**:
New in SQL Server 2014, In-Memory OLTP is a memory-optimized OLTP database engine for SQL Server. Depending on the reason for poor performance with your disk-based tables, In-Memory OLTP can help you achieve significant performance and scalability gains by using algorithms that are optimized for accessing memory-resident data, optimistic concurrency control that eliminates logical locks, lock free objects are used to access all data and threads that perform transactional work don’t use locks or latches for concurrency control.

In-memory OLTP is essentially the latest evolution in database engine technology and provides full durability for memory-optimized tables.
