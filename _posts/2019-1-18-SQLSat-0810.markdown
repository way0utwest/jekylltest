## Title: Headless chicken - calming the sysadmin that turned DBA
 
**Abstract**:
Last night you went to bed as a sysadmin, but today you are realizing with a rising dread that you have woken up as a DBA. It sounds like a bad dream, but it doesn't seem to go away. Maybe the previous DBA won a million bucks and quit on the spot or was hit by a bus and will spend the next couple of months in the hospital; the fact remains that you're now THE DBA. It really doesn't matter if you have a single database on-prem or thirty in the cloud - you've pulled the short straw and you quickly need to get up to speed. This session is a fast-paced, exciting and fun database primer for sysadmins. You will learn how to best feed and care for your new toy, where to scratch, where to kick and most importantly - what never to do. Bring me your fear and despair and I will give you the confidence needed to continue your new DBA journey.

## Title: Data Quality matters! Go for a quality roundtrip in the MS data platform
 
**Abstract**:
In the times of data explosion, a dazzling array of information streams and unbelievable possibilities of different techniques to manage data via the Microsoft Data Platform, this session asks the question: what about data curation? 
We dive into the requirements of modern curation and show in examples, what the Microsoft Data Platform has to offer: Can SQL Server Master Data Service (MDS), Data Quality Services (DQS) and Integration Service (SSIS) especially with the integration in ADF help? Which options offers the Azure Data Catalog and how does the Microsoft Common Data Service come into play? We also look at the potential of the new integrated languages in the Data Platform like R or U-SQL. At the end of this session you will have an overview and understanding of the possibilities, that Microsoft Data Platform offers you to address your data curation requirements.

## Title: Enterprise Power BI – Development Lifecycle
 
**Abstract**:
When your development team is up to a certain size, and often no matter what size it is, you want to start following best development practices. 
These include things like source control, multiple environments, deployment processes, and governance. 

As Power BI content is developed using Power BI Desktop and not Visual Studio as most Microsoft BI solutions are, these things can get tricky. In this session we will look at what Power BI has to offer when it comes to development lifecycle. 
We will look at the different options available to the developer when it comes to source control, multiple environments, deployment and distribution of Power BI content. Lastly, we will look at governance and see how it is possible to secure the content and audit the usage of Power BI. 

For all these topics we will look at the capabilities Power BI offers and how we, in the company where I work, decided to implement it.

## Title: Der moderne DBA in einer heterogenen Datenbankwelt: Performance- und Verfügbarkeitsüberwachung
 
**Abstract**:
Die Überwachung der Datenbankperformance und der Verfügbarkeit war schon immer ein essentieller Bestandteil der täglichen Administration.  Neben den klassischen Systemen wie dem SQL Server etablieren sich auch Open Source-Lösungen und NoSQL Datenbanken am Markt und gewinnen an Bedeutung in der Unternehmensinfrastruktur. Die steigende Zahl von Datenbanken, für die ein DBA verantwortlich ist und die verschiedenen Architekturen, machen eine zentrale und einheitliche Überwachung von Performance- und Verfügbarkeitsmetriken unumgänglich. Wir diskutieren die Probleme und Lösungsansätze, um einen Teil der Arbeit für DBAs zu erleichtern.

## Title: Don't Cross the Streams! A Closer Look at Azure Stream Analytics
 
**Abstract**:
Azure is ready to receive all your event and device data for storage and analysis. But which options in the Azure message handling portfolio should you use to receive and manage your data? In this session I will explain the different options, take a closer look at how they work and what this means for you. Furthermore, I will take a closer look at the Azure Stream Analytics (ASA) language. You will learn how to develop both simple and complex ASA queries, and how to debug. We will look at the possibilities, limitations and pitfalls in the Azure Stream Analytics language. And finally, look at the different input and output choices and when to use which one. This includes a look at how to build a live stream dashboard with Stream Analytics data in PowerBI. The session is based on real world project experiences and will use real world data in the demos.

## Title: SQL Server 2017: Data Science with Python or R?
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2016 brought support or the R language. SQL Server 2017 added a new language to the list, the Python language. Both languages target advanced analytics scenarios, popularly known as data science. For a SQL Server professional who wants to move in the data science area, the first question is which language to choose. In this presentation, you will learn basics about both languages. We will try to solve the same problem with both languages. This way, through demos with a lot of explanation, you will realize the most important differences between the two competing languages. You will understand which one is more appropriate for you to start with.

## Title: Query Store without SQL 2016 = Open Query Store
 
**Abstract**:
When SQL Server 2016 was released, it offered a fantastic new feature with the Query Store. Long term, statistics based, query tuning became a reality. But what about the thousands of servers that aren't upgrading to SQL 2016 or newer? The open source project Open Query Store is designed to fulfill that need.

This session will give a short introduction to the Query Store feature in SQL 2016 and then dive into the Open Query Store (OQS) solution. William (co-creator of the OQS project) will explain the design of OQS and demonstrate the features. You will leave this session with an understanding of the features of Query Store and Open Query Store, and a desire to implement OQS in your systems when you return to the office.

## Title: Start testing your SSIS packages with ssisUnit
 
**Abstract**:
How do you test your SSIS packages? Do you prepare them, set the parameters and variables, maybe get some sample or production data and run few times by hand in SSDT? It’s not a bad practice when you start your ETL journey, but after some time you probably think about automation. If not – you should. Perhaps you have some SQL scripts that verify data in the tables after package execution, but if you are like me, somewhere inside you feel that it’s not enough. It’s time you start automated SSIS unit and integration testing.

On this session, I will show you how to start with automated testing of the packages and the whole projects using ssisUnit – the free SSIS testing library. I will start with some basics and move forward to the real-life examples of the unit and integration testing of the SSIS packages/ projects/solutions. You will see the benefits of automated testing and that testing is hard only at the beginning.

## Title: FROM DATA LAKE TO DAX QUERY
 
**Abstract**:
Collecting data from and combining data out of different data sources is the essential requirement for BI. In times of cloud services this is getting a lot easier.
Azure offers a variety of services that work hand in hand and can be fully automated using PowerShell or.NET.

In this session we will show an example of how data from various sources such as FTP, databases or streaming data can be loaded via ADF and processed in Azure Data Lake.

But getting the information out of Azure Data Lake still requires a special skill set and doesn‘t allow for usage by the broader audience or standard visualization tools. This is a typical requirement of Azure Analysis Services.

But how to implement the model? Can this even be automated in a way?
We will present you one approach to accomplish this.

## Title: Shard Attack - Horizontal Scaling in Azure SQL Database
 
**Abstract**:
Traditionally, when a server starts to reach its limit we have simply thrown more resources at it, either more CPU, memory or disk. 
However there comes a point, especially in the cloud, where it is no longer possible to add more resources to a single database.  Here we need a different solution.
Instead of scaling up we must scale out, sometimes called horizontal scaling or sharding.
 
In this talk we will look at how to scale out in Microsoft Azure SQL database using the Azure Elastic Database tools
We will look at the requirements and options for horizontal scaling in Azure and then we will have a go at sharding an Azure SQL database and then querying and updating the different shards
We will be using t-sql, PowerShell and c# so come prepared for some serious coding

## Title: Persistence is Futile - Implementing Delayed Durability in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
The concurrency model of most Relational Database Systems are defined by the ACID properties but as they aim for ever increasing transactional throughput, those rules are bent, ignored, or even broken.

In this session, we will investigate how SQL Server implements transactional durability in order to understand how Delayed Durability bends the rules to remove transactional bottlenecks and achieve improved throughput. We will take a look at how this can be used to compliment In-Memory OLTP performance, and how it might impact or compromise other things.

Attend this session and you will be assimilated!

## Title: Power BI Data Modeling
 
**Abstract**:
This session explains why data modeling is so important even if Power BI utilizes the in-memory columnar xVelocity engine or simply SSAS Tabular. Different data modeling approaches are compared from a performance point of view, but also the complexity of DAX measures is compared that are incorporated in different data models. 
New data modeling features like many-to-many relationships and aggregations have been released during the last months. This session demonstrates how these features can be used to solve complex problems and how these techniques can be used on top of large amounts of data.
