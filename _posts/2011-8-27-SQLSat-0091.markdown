## Title: Top Ten DBA Mistakes 
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on the market.  But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy.  And it doesn’t mean that database administration on SQL Server is problem free.  And since SQL Server is constantly growing from small, home-grown applications, many IT professionals end up encountering issues that others had tackled and solved years ago.  Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again.  In fact, wouldn’t you like to learn about those mistakes before they ever happen?  There are a short list of mistakes that, if you know of them in advance, will make your life much easier.

## Title: SQL Server Internals  Architecture
 
**Abstract**:
Let’s face it. You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works. Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes. But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture. This session will answer questions like: - What’s different about 32- and 64-bit systems? - What are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server? - How are queries handled behind the scenes? - What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers? - ...and much more.

## Title: Data to Dashboards:Back to Basics 
 
**Abstract**:
Is Business Intelligence a critical strategy within your organization?  Companies that have a depth of analytic support, that use it across their entire organization, and value the insights they gain from their analytic solutions—these are companies far more likely to be high corporate performers.  And as such, availability of analytics across the enterprise, and the USE of those analytics—this can drive competitive differentiation for an organization.  In this session, we will move past the technology and discuss the value of focusing on some very basic, but very critical components to be considered when developing your Business Intelligence strategy.

## Title: End-to-End Troubleshooting
 
**Abstract**:
Learning how to detect, diagnose and resolve performance problems in SQL Server can be very difficult. It often takes years of on-the-job experience to learn how to use the tools and techniques that help you detect when a problem is occurring, diagnose the root-cause of the problem, and then resolve the problem. This hands-on session will take you from the very start of a problem situation on SQL Server, showing you how to use the native tools that help you keep SQL Server at top performance.

## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Performance for Devs
 
**Abstract**:
If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production and how this can be avoided.

## Title: Don't push the turbo button!  Understanding Transa
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server offers several isolation levels beyond the default "READ COMMITTED".  But understanding when to use each one can be daunting.  Whether you are a developer who needs to understand how isolation works and  and why NOLOCK is not an appropriate hint in most cases, or a seasoned DBA who needs to understand the less commonly used isolation methods, this session is for you.  We will look at each level, how it impacts the engine, and examine appropriate (and inapproriate) use cases for each.

I have been a Microsoft Premier Field Engineer for four years, assisting customers with SQL Server Analysis Services, SQL Server Integration Services and the SQL Server Relational Engine. I don’t have to find myself to be the smartest guy in the room to be helpful because I have seen more environments and issues than most dbas and can share my experiences that help others to focus in on what is important rather than what is more likely to be of academic interest.
