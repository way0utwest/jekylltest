##Title: Leverage Power BI automation using APIs and Flow##
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI is a cloud-based service; it means that it comes along with a standard set of APIs that provides access to its internal resources such as reports, datasets, rows.   
Using APIs gives more flexibility and allows to build custom dashboard applications either for administering or query the service.  
And if you combine the power of APIs with Microsoft Flow, you can automate some background processes such as adding users, granting rights, update or refresh datasets, ... 
The session is demo only. A complete walk-through to the process, will show you how to register an app, create a custom connector and leverage Power BI API actions by triggering a Microsoft Flow object. https://speakerscore.com/VK14

LinkedIn: [Veronica Nuvolone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronica-nuvolone-b04820121/)
Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

##Title: Building a modern data warehouse and BI solution in Microsoft cloud##
 
**Abstract**:
Data warehouse and BI market is evolving rapidly with the appearance of new cloud born technologies. We might assume, that moving an existing Microsoft based DWH to the cloud is an easy step, but when we dig a little bit deeper, we will see, there are many-many new technological choices and aspects on how to modernize an existing dwh/bi system in the cloud. Not to mention if we start everything from scratch in a new project designed specifically to the cloud to utilize cloud flexibility and innovation as much as possible. 
Which ETL tool should I use? Data factory v2 with SSIS and BIML, or Azure Databricks powered Dataflows? Or Power BI Dataflow? Which is the right decision to run OLAP workloads? Azure AS? Or simply Power BI? When do I need Azure SQL DWH?
In the last couple years I helped many customers to modernize their DWH landscape partially or fully in the cloud and during my presentation I will share my findings and recipes for the most common situation I met. You will have fun:) https://speakerscore.com/W9GC

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

##Title: Query Processing improvements in the latest versions of SQL Server – IT##
 
**Abstract**:
How many times have you faced bad performances caused by incorrect rows-estimation or caused by multi-statement user-defined table valued functions? Have you ever seen a warning on Sort operator that spills data on tempdb caused by inadequate memory estimation? These are not the only problems we could have with queries optimization, but these are the three problems that SQL Server 2017 Adaptive Query Processing attempts to address. SQL Server 2019 introduces additional features and all of them are known with the name Intelligent Query Processing. This session will cover the Adaptive Query Processing first. Next we will cover, briefly, the features implemented in SQL Server 2019.

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

##Title: A gentle introduction to Apache Spark for SQL Server people##
 
**Abstract**:
Lavorando con i dati, capita sempre più frequentmente di doversi confrontare con mondi che fino a poco tempo fa erano quasi estranei fra loro. 
SQL Server 2019, per esempio, introduce per la prima volta con i nuovi Big Data Cluster il supporto nativo ad Apache Spark, rendendo concreta la convivenza tra il carico di lavoro tipico di un engine relazionale e il calcolo distribuito.

Proveniendo da un ambiente SQL, l'approccio ad Apache Spark tramite il suo dialetto Spark SQL può sembrare molto naturale e poco ostico. La sensazione di "sentirsi a casa", però, non deve far dimenticare che l'engine sottostante ragiona in modo molto diverso da quello a cui siamo abituati.

In questa sessione proveremo ad avvicinarci ad Apache Spark partendo dalle sue basi, così da capire come ragiona e conoscerlo per affrontarlo al meglio. https://speakerscore.com/C4XR

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

##Title: The databases in SSDT - a work with project and best practices##
 
**Abstract**:
A task seems to be easy. Maintenance a project of a database in the code repository, treat as master-version and do deployment evenly and frequently. Simple? Seemingly. The things become more complex as fast as a number of objects in database growing. While instead of one database, we have over a dozen. When databases have got the references to each other. And how about dictionary tables? Where to keep them and how to script? Additional issues are coming whilst we would like to control instance-level objects.
All these topics I will explain in the session focused on practical aspects of work with Microsoft Visual Studio Data Tools. https://speakerscore.com/25GX

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

##Title: SQL Server Lift  Shift on Azure!##
 
**Abstract**:
Sempre più spesso le aziende migrano i propri datacenter, o parte di essi, in cloud. Quando si arriva alla componente SQL Server delle diverse isole applicative, ci si trova davanti alla possibilità di migrare il workload SQL su una pletora di servizi diversi, tra VM in IaaS e Azure SQL Database in PaaS.

LinkedIn: [Veronica Nuvolone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronica-nuvolone-b04820121/)
Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

##Title: Synapse Analytics: Beyond the Basics##
 
**Abstract**:
Let's discover how to configure Synapse Analytics in order to achieve better result from the MPP environment, going beyond the default configuration

Synapse Analytics, which is way beyond the former Azure SQL Data Warehouse, is focused on MPP, Multi Parallel Processing, being a very powerful environment for Data Warehouse processing. It's former name, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, usually pushed many DW and BI developers to use this powerful tool in order to build a Data Warehouse. However, just implementing the logical design of a Data Warehouse inside an MPP environment can be very deceiving, because many default settings for the MPP environment will not be at their best. On this session you will see how to configure the MPP environment to achieve it's best performance for your Data Warehouse. You will understand the importance to understand and control the distributions by compute nodes, how critical are the correct choice of resource classes and users, the benefits to correct manage.  https://speakerscore.com/Z111

A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

##Title: Ottimizzare SQL Server su VMWare: come si fa?##
 
**Abstract**:
Abbiamo installato SQL Server su una macchina virtuale VMWare seguendo (vero ?) tutte le best practices. Ma ancora non abbiamo le performance desiderate. Come si analizzano e risolvono le problematiche di performance su una VM? Quali sono le metriche da prendere in considerazione? E quali strumenti utilizzare? In questa sessione demo-oriented cercheremo di capire proprio questo.

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

##Title: Microsoft Power BI fast with aggregation and composite model##
 
**Abstract**:
Il modello composito consente di avere tabelle enormi come origine DirectQuery e alcune tabelle più piccole in modalità di importazione. Quando parliamo di tabelle enormi le prestazioni sono sempre una sfida. In questa sessione, parleremo di come le aggregazioni possono essere utili per accelerare le prestazioni. Puoi vedere come gigabyte di dati possono essere analizzati e visualizzati in meno di un secondo. Scopri molti suggerimenti, trucchi e aspetti interni sulle aggregazioni in Power BI e sul loro utilizzo in un modello composito. https://speakerscore.com/MDN9

When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

**Abstract**:
Jupyter Notebooks and Apache Spark are first class citizens of the Data Science space, a truly requirement for the "modern" data scientist. But there was a requirement: being a python developer. Now Microsoft is investing on C# as another first class citizen in this space. Let's look what .net can do for notebooks and spark and what are notebooks and spark. https://speakerscore.com/Z2F6

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

##Title: Monitoring SQL Server without breaking the bank##
 
**Abstract**:
Monitoring SQL Server can become a very expensive business. Sure, the market offers countless paid solutions, but what if you have a large server estate and your budget is tight? 
In this session we will combine multiple open source tools (InfluxDB, Telegraf , Grafana, DbaTools and many more) to collect important performance metrics, analyze the data they collect, set up alert for the critical events, troubleshoot issues and plan for the future. Join me and you will see how monitoring is not a business for billionaires. https://speakerscore.com/76VR

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

##Title: How scale SQL with Serverless##
 
**Abstract**:
Il serverless è la nuova frontiera dello sviluppo Cloud e le Azure Functions sono uno degli strumenti a disposizione per implementare questo nuovo paradigma. SQL Server è un componente importante nell'ecosistema Azure ma non esiste, al momento, un modo "chiavi in mano" per poterlo utilizzare all'interno delle Azure Functions.
In questa sessione vedremo come scalare correttamente una applicazione che ha la necessità di scrivere e leggere su SQL Azure e di come ridurre al minimo il codice applicativo. https://speakerscore.com/JTKD

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

##Title: Introduction to M in Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
Uno dei punti di forza di Power BI risiede nelle performance del suo engine di Power Query e nella capacità di semplificare lo sviluppo dell'intera fase ETL attraverso l'uso della sola interfaccia grafica. Ma dietro le quinte ogni nostro "click" si traduce in codice "M" e conoscere tale linguaggio consente di ampliare  ulteriormente le potenzialità di Power BI e quindi dei nostri modelli. In questa sessione introduttiva verranno descritti i principali costrutti e le regole base del linguaggio e si mostreranno alcuni esempi pratici di utilizzo all'interno dei modelli di Power BI. https://speakerscore.com/BQ76

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

##Title: SQL Server Data Virtualization with Polybase##
 
**Abstract**:
Polybase è la tecnologia introdotta con SQL Server 2016 per eseguire query distribuite in ambienti eterogenei. Inizialmente con un supporto di sistemi esterni limitato, in SQL Server 2019 è stato esteso per supportare non solo Hadoop e SQL Server in tutte le declinazioni, tra cui Azure SQL Data Warehouse, ma anche Teradata, Oracle, MongoDB e sistemi generici accessibili via ODBC. In questa sessione vedremo come funziona il meccanismo di integrazione dal punto di vista tecnico con qualche esempio pratico. https://speakerscore.com/8P1Q

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…

Since graduating in Business Economics and Management, I understood that marketing would be my job vocation. At the beginning I had not considered Information Technology as the industry in which to express and improve my creative and communication skills. 
A bit by chance, I began my short work experience in this area and I was immediately fascinated. The data is "the new electricity" of every business and learning how to channel its value through social media was an opportunity that I could not lose. 
When I met SolidQ in 2016, I understood that it was my chance to learn from great experts and contribute to the creation and communication of the value of this company.

**Gilberto Zampatti** 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…
