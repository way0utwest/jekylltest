## Title: The "Data Loading Performance Guide" Presentation
 
**Abstract**:
Loading huge amounts of data into SQL Server can be challenging. There are quite a few factors that can help, or hurt your goal for tuned performance. For this reason, bulk loading with large amounts of data requires a strategy.

For that strategy, Microsoft has published a famous whitepaper called “The Data Loading Performance Guide.” The problem is that this guide is long and full of small details that can be confusing and daunting at first glance.

In this session, we will turn this whitepaper into a presentation about creating a strategy to optimize your massive data loading processes by applying the techniques mentioned in the whitepaper, as well as other advanced techniques that have emerged since the whitepaper was published.

We will talk about solutions to achieve High Performance Data Loading, Minimal Logging and Bulk Loading, Indexing Techniques including Columstore, properly leveraging Parallelism and Partitioning, Truncate Partition, PolyBase, Delayed Durability, and more.

## Title: Incremental Load Design Patterns
 
**Abstract**:
The volume of data addressed by the typical ETL operation is constantly on the rise.  Not so many years ago, a table with a few million records was considered to be huge.  These days, it's not uncommon to deal with multibillion row tables.  As a result, ETL professionals are frequently tasked with finding efficient ways to incrementally process these large sets of data without resorting to expensive and time-consuming destructive reloads.
 
In this session, we will review the common decision points surrounding incrementally loading data, and will demonstrate some of the methods for incremental processing.  Among the topics of discussion:
--Deciding whether an incremental load is appropriate
--Pick your tool: T-SQL or SSIS?
--Methods for detecting new and changed records
--Common incremental load design patterns

**Abstract**:
If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

## Title: Finding root cause for unexplained Availability Group failover
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, we will walk you step by step through one or more support cases that demonstrate how we determine root cause analysis of an unexplained failure in an Availability Group.  Whether the databases simply became unavailable, synchronization stopped, or there was an unexplained failover.   We will show you specifically what we look for in the OS Cluster logs, SQL error logs, Extended Events and other sources of information.
