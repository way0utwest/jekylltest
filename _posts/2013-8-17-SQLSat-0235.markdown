## Title: Big Data-BI Fusion: Microsoft HDInsight  MS BI
 
**Abstract**:
HDInsight is the name of Microsoft’s distribution of Apache Hadoop, the essential and defining technology of the Big Data world. But why in the world would Microsoft embrace an open source technology, written in Java, and customarily run on clusters of Linux servers? Two words: Business Intelligence. HDInsight (and Hadoop in general) become far more enterprise-friendly when combined with Microsoft BI technologies like PowerPivot, Analysis Services and Power View. And then there’s SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse, which actually blends the BI and Big Data worlds together in one product. In this session, Microsoft BI expert and ZDNet Big Data blogger Andrew Brust will introduce you to HDInsight and its developer tools, demonstrate relevant BI tools and show how they work together. He’ll also show how developers with relational database skills can make the jump into this exciting and opportunity-filled area.

## Title: Advanced T-SQL Development with latest features.
 
**Abstract**:
In the last three releases,  SQL Server development was enriched with new T-SQL features, such as CTE (common table extension), array of Ranking functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DANGERANK, TILE), MERGE statement, OUTPUT clause, EXCEPT and INTERSECT just to name a few. For various reasons some DBA/Developers do not utilize these new features. In this session, the audience will see demonstrations of the different practical use cases where these features can make T-SQL coding more efficient. This 100% code-based demo session highlights efficiency to utilize the latest T-SQL functions over conventional methods with the same functionality. The session will cover in depth live scenarios where these features have proven performance efficiency, code re

## Title: Surviving Your Peak Database Load
 
**Abstract**:
Each application and system is different, but all have a similar quality: there will be times where the systems are used more, and other times where they may appear to be sleeping. Good examples are monthly, quarterly, and yearly for financial systems and the holiday season for retail. The last thing you want to have in these time frames is your CxO standing at your desk wondering why things are slow or possibly down. Ensuring that your SQL Servers are optimally configured for those heavy usage periods cannot be done with a wing and a prayer – you need an actionable, realistic plan. This session will discuss how to guarantee that your SQL Server instances and the configurations they use are as scalable and reliable as possible.

## Title: How to Build a Centralized Database Monitoring Solution – Never Miss a Backup
 
**Abstract**:
As every DBA knows, the one question you want to be able to answer affirmatively is “Can you recover that data?”  

Monitoring is critical, but monitoring methods can be imperfect.  Traditional methods are difficult to set up and maintain across your entire environment, resulting in incomplete monitoring and missed alerts, so that it’s difficult to be sure of your answer to that all important question. 

This presentation will:

•	Show you how to implement a better way to monitor your database environment that is more efficient, easier to maintain, and guarantees that you never miss an alert.
•	Share the methodology, framework, and key syntax, so that you are certain the databases you are responsible for are always up, always backed up, and never run out of disk/file space.

So that your answer to that all important question is always YES!

## Title: Into the Blue: Extending AlwaysOn Availability Groups
 
**Abstract**:
For many organizations, having a second data center or co-location center doesn’t make sense, financially or logistically. Typically, this would limit options for building out a disaster recovery (DR) solution. However, now with Windows Azure virtual machines and SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups, you can connect your on-premise solution to a real-time secondary replica, providing read scalability and a solid DR solution.

This session will demonstrate how to extend an Availability Group into Windows Azure, discussing the pros and cons as well as the cost of the solution. You will walk away with a solid understanding of AlwaysOn functionality within Windows Azure VMs, the costs and benefits of building a DR solution within Windows Azure, and how Azure-based backup and recovery can work.

## Title: Database Development with SQL Server Data Tools
 
**Abstract**:
With the release of SQL Server 2012, the new SQL Server Data Tools serves as your primary development environment for building applications on top of SQL Server. SSDT plugs in to Visual Studio with tooling designed specifically for the application developer. With SSDT, developers no long need to constantly switch between VS and SSMS. In this session, Lenni demonstrates how SSDT is used to develop for (and deploy to) on-premise and Windows Azure SQL Database. You will learn how to use code navigation, IntelliSense, and refactoring with your database model, and how to design databases offline and under source control right from VS. Don’t miss out on this demo-centric information-packed session on the new generation of database tools for developers!

## Title: Windows Azure SQL Database Design: Silver Lining and Dark Side
 
**Abstract**:
Data modelers and designers need to understand the logical, physical, and technical differences in designing for Windows Azure SQL Databases (WASDs) and traditional on-premise SQL Server databases. In this session, we'll review the concepts that still work in both and the features that need to be tailored to each target environment.

You’ll see demonstrations of the database design processes and gain best practices for model-driven development for each environment, including tool support. The session will feature a demonstration of a complete life cycle roundtrip – data model to database and back to data model – and tips and tricks for creating and maintaining WASD database designs. We’ll finish up with 10 tips for designing databases for both WASD and SQL Server.

## Title: SQL Server Internals and Architecture
 
**Abstract**:
Let’s face it.  You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works.  Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes.  But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture.  This session will answer questions like:
-       What’s different about 32- and 64-bit systems?
-       What are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server?
-       How are queries handled behind the scenes?
-       What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers?
-       What happens during checkpoints?  Lazywrites?
-       How are IOs handled with regards to transaction logs and database?
-       What happens when transaction logs and databases grow or shrinks?

## Title: Using Power View  Hadoop to Unlock Hidden Markets
 
**Abstract**:
A practical way to derive business value from big data is to micro-target customers, but where do you begin? In this session, we examine real data from one of the nation's largest cable TV providers and combine it with data from the 2010 census and other data sources. Then we walk through a demonstration of how to use Hadoop and the Microsoft BI stack with this integrated data to develop powerful analytics quickly and easily. We demystify the process of working with big data by showing you first how to gather and load the data into Hadoop, and then how to extract a subset of that data and apply data visualization to reveal insightful patterns that you can use to connect more effectively with customers.

## Title: Indexing your Data Warehouse
 
**Abstract**:
One of the primary skill sets most database professionals are initially required to “master” is the art of proper indexing in our databases. We learn early on that an effective indexing configuration will go further in making our databases perform efficiently than probably any other single tuning technique. What’s not so commonly discussed though are the varying approaches one may wish to utilize when indexing your SQL Server enterprise data warehouse.  This session will hopefully cause you to take a good look at your current indexing to see if indeed it could be operating even more efficiently.

## Title: “Indexing” Encrypted Data
 
**Abstract**:
As a SQL Server DBA I see my role having 2 main focuses. First is to protect the data and second is to ensure performance is maximized. More often than not companies forget about data security when they focus on performance tuning. In this presentation I will mention a few cases where encryption could have saved a lot of hassle. I will then demo a method that can be used to "index" commonly searched on encrypted values (ex: SSNs, Credit Card, etc) helping reduce the impact on the performance of a query.
