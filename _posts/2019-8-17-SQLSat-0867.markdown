##Title: A Map To Success:  Functional Programming For Database Developers##
 
**Abstract**:
Over the past several years, we have seen a resurgence of interest in functional programming languages, particularly with the success of Scala and R in the marketplace.  Although object-oriented (oo) design remains the dominant software development paradigm, even oo-first languages have seen a shift toward the functional mindset with the emphasis on LINQ in C# and lambdas in Java.  This move toward a functional style should be particularly welcome for data platform specialists, who already have a leg up in understanding  functional programming concepts thanks to their work with SQL.

In this talk, we will focus on one functional programming language, F#.  We will look at some of the basics of the language and see how you can translate knowledge of SQL into a pipeline-driven functional programming language.  We will also see areas where F# integrates smoothly with SQL, creating a powerful way to extend your SQL skills beyond queries.

##Title: Approaching Zero:  Minimizing Downtime During Deployments##
 
**Abstract**:
Negotiating a downtime for a release can be difficult in this modern, 24x7 world.  When downtime means lost revenue, the price of taking a downtime to deploy code can run up quickly.  This talk will show you a way to reduce the cost of deployment by reducing or even eliminating required downtime for database code deployment.  We will show how to release new database code, update existing stored procedures, refactor and restructure tables, and even perform systemic re-architecture with no downtime and minimal blocking.  We will use as a case study one release in which we modified the primary key column on 180 tables and updated over 550 stored procedures without end users noticing a thing.  If you want to hit that three nines (or better) service-level agreement, this talk will help get you on the road to reduced downtime.

##Title: Climbing the SQL Server Index B-Tree##
 
**Abstract**:
You’ll find a lot of Word of Mouth (WOM) advice out there about SQL Server performance, especially
when it comes to indexes. Some of the things you have probably heard are:
 keep clustered index width small
 unique indexes perform better
 keep non-clustered index width small
 compressed indexes have fewer logical reads
 add one index for each column

But how do you know if this advice is good or bad? Did you know that there is a way to look under the hood at the actual index pages to see how the data is stored, and how it’s stored differently when data is compressed? Using this information, you can prove or disprove the WOM advice.
Attend this demo-heavy session to learn how the SQL Server optimizer uses indexes. It’s all about
performance, and the right indexes will give your application a big performance advantage.

##Title: Taming of the Shrew - Optimizing Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
No one wants to tell a report user that while running a report in Power BI they have time to go get a cup of coffee…in another town.  Although data sets will often be the focus of performance issues, it’s important to know how to locate performance problems in Power BI and how to eliminate them.  

This session will take the Power User through how to identify time consuming processing in Power BI and how to address it through step-by-step and proven methods used to optimize in multi-tier environments.  This method removes frustration and finger-pointing and gets to the heart of the problem with a goal of correcting performance challenges.  The results are satisfied end users who get the information they need, when they need it.

Take Aways:
Learn how to identify what is taking the time in a Power BI data set and report.
Understand the logging and tracing mechanisms and capabilities in the environment.
Understand when a problem is really a problem.

##Title: Be Part of the Solution with Automation##
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps automation can be intriguing to learn and overwhelming to implement. This session will take a real life use case of a multi-tier and complex environments, with various stake holders to a successful conclusion.  Unlike a session on concepts, this session surrounds itself with a real-life situation and how automation was used with DevOps practices to build a solution.
The session will demonstrate the reasons to automate, along with the steps required to make it possible, offering insight into concepts that are often too vague to employ. The attendee will see multi-platform and cloud tool demonstrations on how to take the DevOps methodology and continuous delivery to actuality in their own projects, no matter if small or large.

He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.

On Jan 12, 2019, Peter attended his first SQL Saturday and experienced an engaging and uplifting community that encouraged everyone regularly to give back. That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.

##Title: Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds. I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. 
Here you’ll learn: 
• The most useful regular expression commands. 
• The appropriate times to use regular expressions. 
• How to use regular expressions to write code for you. 
• How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.

##Title: The SQL Career Roadmap for Women (and Men)##
 
**Abstract**:
The ideal way to become a SQL Server professional is to get a degree, get a junior position, and then work your way up. But, the vast majority of data professionals don’t follow this path! Instead, most of us start out as “accidental DBAs” and fumble our way into a full time data career.
This is not ideal, and we could all use some help navigating through resumes, job hunting, interviews, and negotiating.
You’ll learn about all that in this session. We will also talk about how to get around a big obstacle for both women and men: how to get back to work after a long period of not working.
How can I get a database job with no experience? What’s the best way to learn the newest technology? What resources are out there? Bring your questions, and we’ll explore the answers.

LinkedIn: [Peter Doyle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thepeterdoyle/)
On Jan 12, 2019, Peter attended his first SQL Saturday and experienced an engaging and uplifting community that encouraged everyone regularly to give back. That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.

##Title: PowerShell + SQL Server = Better Together##
 
**Abstract**:
As a SQL Server professional, are you able to make a rhyme or reason to this thing called PowerShell? Need to accomplish something? Do you use Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core? How will you interface with PowerShell? With the PowerShell console, ISE, VSCode, SAPIEN PowerShell Studio, or something else? Will you use Cmdlets from one of the various SQL related PowerShell modules? If so, which one? SQLPS, SQLServer, DBATools, etc. Or maybe you should use the SQL PS provider? What about SMO? Or write your own custom .NET code that can be executed with PowerShell? With it being so difficult to determine how to go about running something in PowerShell, it’s no wonder that most people resort to searching the Internet to figure it out. The sad thing is that most of the PowerShell code you’ll find on the Internet is less than optimal to say the least. I'll demonstrate how and when to use different approaches along with adhering to the community’s best practices for writing PowerShell code.

##Title: Using Open Source Software to Collect Performance Metrics##
 
**Abstract**:
Ever had a manager standing over your shoulder, wanting to know why an instance is running slow or if it can handle additional workload? If only you knew what performance metrics to collect and had them for your existing instances to answer these questions.

In this session, we will discuss sp_whoisactive and Query Store to track what queries are running. Then we will be combining three open source tools – Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana – into an inexpensive and easy to set up system that collects performance metrics you can use to troubleshoot issues and answer important questions about your SQL Server instances, including your Linux SQL Server instances, Azure Managed Instances and Azure SQL Databases. 

Attendees will see how easy it is to get good performance data and visualize it interactively and combine with other tools to troubleshoot issues. Finally, we will look at problem I solved using this solution as an example.

##Title: Containers - You Better Get on Board!##
 
**Abstract**:
Containers are taking over, changing the way systems are developed and deployed…and that’s NOT hyperbole. Just imagine if you could deploy SQL Server or even your whole application stack in just minutes. You can do that, leveraging containers! In this session, we’ll get you started on your container journey learning container fundamentals in Docker, then look at some common container scenarios and introduce deployment automation with Kubernetes.

On Jan 12, 2019, Peter attended his first SQL Saturday and experienced an engaging and uplifting community that encouraged everyone regularly to give back. That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.

##Title: Building Quality Web APIs with Asp.Net Core##
 
**Abstract**:
We’ve all done “dotnet new webapi” and got our values from the ValuesController.  Now what do we do next?  In this talk we will discuss how to structure our project(s), create good api urls, handle versioning, unit test our api, and secure our endpoints.  There are plenty of examples of best practices for .Net Core Web APIs.  We will look at them and figure out why we would want to implement these practices.  We will also identify the benefits for doing so.

##Title: Azure Databricks (ADB) and the Traditional DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
As more data services come online in Microsoft Azure, DBAs are being tasked with bringing these services into their organizations.  Azure Databricks is one such service that has the appeal of combining scalable compute resources with collaborative development and analytic tools in Notebooks and workspaces.  To the traditional DBA, however, many of the concepts and language support may be foreign. What the heck is Scala anyway?  This session is designed to introduce the DBA to the Azure Databricks workspace and show how to easily integrate it with upstream and downstream services like Azure Data Factory, Machine Learning and Power BI.

##Title: All (Data) Things Considered: The Lean Coffee Workshop##
 
**Abstract**:
Collaboration is the heart of SQLSaturday's, but too often attendees move from session to session in a passive learning mode.  This session is based on the Lean Coffee model, and is a structured workshop with no pre-planned agenda.  The goal is to involve YOU in the conversation; bring your questions, your answers, your business cards, and your desire to learn.  YOU set the agenda, YOU decide when to move on, and YOU engage and learn.

##Title: The Game Master's Guide to People Management##
 
**Abstract**:
The dust settles from the massive blow dealt by Erin's quick and, in your opinion, very creative thinking. A monster has been looming over your crew for weeks and it’s now on its last legs. All eyes make their way across the table and over to Jim, who is eager to roll the dice and deal the final blow. A final few clicks from the conference room mouse and the beast is felled. The room erupts in celebration as Jim logs into the new environment, spun up entirely by their efforts and investments in “Infrastructure as Code”.

As much as some might want to draw a line between work and play, there is much that they can have in common. In this session we'll take a look at what we, as people managers, can learn from role playing games and the relationship that evolves between a game master and their players. We'll talk about identifying what motivates our team members and tools and strategies we can employ to create an environment that keeps them challenged, interested, and engaged.

On Jan 12, 2019, Peter attended his first SQL Saturday and experienced an engaging and uplifting community that encouraged everyone regularly to give back. That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.

##Title: TDD With No Tears##
 
**Abstract**:
Unit testing is hard to get right. Are you testing too much? Too little? How do you write tests that aren't a waste of time? Isn't testing supposed to enable refactoring? Then why do they seem to be in the way? What's this BDD thing I keep hearing about? Do we need to learn yet another tool?

This talk goes deep into the philosophy behind unit testing in general and test-driven development in particular. We will discuss how to keep things simple yet useful and showcase a strategy for writing tests that achieve our goals without wasting everybody's time.

##Title: Goodbye Classes: Writing React the Functional Way##
 
**Abstract**:
Whether you are new to React, or a veteran, there is plenty to gain from this talk.

In this session you will learn techniques using higher order functions to keep your React and JavaScript code functional and maintainable. The recompose library is going to be used to accomplish this in React.

We will be referencing a full front end stack utilizing the most up to date modern web stack for Single Page Application (SPA) development: Webpack 4, React 16, Redux, Bootstrap 4, ESLint with StandardJS, Sagas, and Jest. 

A reasonable familiarity with JavaScript is expected, as well as Node and npm are prerequisites to running this locally.

LinkedIn: [Peter Doyle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thepeterdoyle/)
On Jan 12, 2019, Peter attended his first SQL Saturday and experienced an engaging and uplifting community that encouraged everyone regularly to give back. That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.

##Title: Azure Automation with PowerShell: Scripting Away the Problems of Yesterday##
 
**Abstract**:
In your day to day job, how many times do you find yourself interrupted to complete a task you've done a thousand times? The repetitive work not only takes resources from more important work but also costs time to ramp up/down. What if you could automate the operation? Better yet, what if you could give approved access to that automation to those that request it, execute it on a regular schedule, or have it react to some event? In this session, we will explore Microsoft's Azure Automation Runbooks, its capabilities, and even demo a few use-cases. This should give you a feel for how this service can help free you from tedious duties and empower the rest of your team!

##Title: PrequelSaturday - How the SQL Server community is about to make your job easier##
 
**Abstract**:
Welcome! You've already discovered the best value anywhere in SQL training; here's how to make the most of it. We'll talk about what to do while you're here and ways to keep up the learning momentum afterward.

You'll also be introduced to several invaluable (and not just because they're free) tools that anyone working with SQL Server needs to be familiar with.

If you're new to SQL Server, when you get back to work on Monday you'll know how to attack the problem you've been struggling with, you'll solve the next problem faster, and you'll know how to find help if you get stuck. Oh, and you'll know about six other problems that used to be hiding from you.

LinkedIn: [Peter Doyle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thepeterdoyle/)
On Jan 12, 2019, Peter attended his first SQL Saturday and experienced an engaging and uplifting community that encouraged everyone regularly to give back. That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.

On Jan 12, 2019, Peter attended his first SQL Saturday and experienced an engaging and uplifting community that encouraged everyone regularly to give back. That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.

##Title: Why There are No Code Problems, Only Organizational Culture Problems##
 
**Abstract**:
Everyone is fascinated by startups.  We watch in awe at the market disruption that some technology companies can create.  The most successful of these plucky, fast-moving startups may grow into large companies.  

The quickest and most disruptive companies may soon struggle under the weight of the increasing scale, expectations, and a shifting organizational culture.   Solving code problems is suddenly no longer the most difficult issue.
 
Have you ever been frustrated at how long it takes to be able to change something in your job, product or organization?  Have you ever measured how long it takes to get a change that's only a few lines of code into production?  Have you ever wondered why the chat service Slack doesn't have a "dark mode"?

Join to discuss
•	how organizations (some real, some apocryphal) deal with product and technology changes
•	how you fit in as a developer, DBA, manager or other consultant, and 
•	what we can all do about it when we get back to work on Monday

##Title: Monitoring SQL Server with Telegraf/InfluxDB/Grafana -- Lessons from the Trenches##
 
**Abstract**:
Following Tracy Boggiano's presentation to the BRSSUG about using open source tools to monitor SQL Server, I tried it myself. Now I can't imagine doing my job without it. But getting to this point required a significant amount of research and trial and error. In this presentation I would like to share some of the lessons learned in this process, so you can get your monitoring solution running and tailored to your needs efficiently.

That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.

##Title: Improve Dist`d System  Web App Performance Using In-Memory Cache##
 
**Abstract**:
Applications often integrate with APIs for the purpose of retrieving data from a disk-based storage system like SQL Server. This poses challenges due slow queries and amount of data sent down the wire. In this presentation, we discuss the performance concerns with this type of architecture especially for big data scenarios.  Oscar Garcia shows how to address those concerns by following a series of steps in which an application is refactored with minimum changes to support an in-memory data store and data streaming.  We start by discussing the challenges when using data queries. We structure the data for in in-memory storage. We replace the API requests with real-time data streaming.

Learning Objectives:

SQL Server Query Challenges

Redis Cache Basic Operations and Structure

Angular App with Socket.io integration

Node.js Backend with Socket.io and Redis support

Real-time data integration

##Title: Serverless Cloud Computing: Promises and Pitfalls##
 
**Abstract**:
You're hearing more and more about serverless computing, but is it really the panacea that cloud vendors make it out to be? Come learn about the promises and pitfalls of serverless cloud computing based on real-world use.

In this session we will:
- Discover where all the cloud servers disappeared to 
- Define what "serverless" actually means
- Discuss use cases that are a good fit for serverless (there will be code!)
- Drive through a top ten list of pitfalls to look out for, and how those pitfalls can enable us to design more resilient applications

This session will provide useful insights for IT decision-makers exploring where serverless fits in their enterprises and for developers who want to go out and quickly build something.

##Title: Inside Kubernetes - An Architectural Deep Dive##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will introduce Kubernetes, we’ll deep dive into each component and its responsibility in a cluster. We will also look at and demonstrate higher-level abstractions such as Services, Controllers, and Deployments and how they can be used to ensure the desired state of an application and data platform deployed in Kubernetes. Next, we’ll look at Kubernetes networking and intercluster communication patterns. With that foundation, we will then introduce various cluster scenarios and high availability designs. By the end of this session, you will understand what's needed to put your applications and data platform in production in a Kubernetes cluster.

On Jan 12, 2019, Peter attended his first SQL Saturday and experienced an engaging and uplifting community that encouraged everyone regularly to give back. That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.

##Title: Extend Azure DevOps with a Custom PowerShell-based Pipeline Task##
 
**Abstract**:
There are times where the Azure DevOps pipeline tasks that are available in the marketplace are not meeting your needs and you wished that you knew how to create your own. After attending this session, you’ll be able to do just that. In this session you’ll learn how to create your own deployable pipeline task with logic written using PowerShell. We’ll craft a custom design time form with a our own service connection, develop a PowerShell script that interacts with an external service, deploy to the marketplace as a private link, and install into an Azure DevOps collection.

Mike Huguet is a Senior Software Engineering Lead on the PowerApps product development team at Microsoft. He and his team focus on features and tooling that aid customers and partners in improving the quality of their PowerApps and customizations to their Common Data Services and Dynamics 365 CE solutions.

##Title: Customizable User Interfaces with Dynamic Components in Angular##
 
**Abstract**:
Modern component-based design has brought developer productivity to new heights, but most are unaware that this pattern can be taken even further. Designers, admins, and users alike could all benefit from additional steps which make these components truly dynamic. New abilities can be unlocked, such as combining components to suit your need or personal preference, even faster development cycles, and lazy-loading components which have not yet been created. While this talk will focus on applying this technique in Angular, the concepts are universal and can be brought to any framework or language. Learn how making your components dynamic is surprisingly easy, and be left wondering why you have not done this sooner.

##Title: Managing ETL Change using BIMLScript##
 
**Abstract**:
Change is constant, especially with source files. Health care claims data files change at least yearly. You develop an SSIS package to load the source file. You meticulously identify each of the columns and map them to the targets. Your package runs fine for months. Then the file format changes. Again, you tediously select each column, etc.  Wouldn't it be nice to simply document the structure of the file, the file's metadata, and generate the SSIS from that metadata?  Your users demand the documentation anyway. If the file changes, you simply change the metadata. To demonstrate such an approach, I import some US census data.  I create the SSIS package using BIMLScript and metadata. When the format changes, I change the metadata and generate a whole new package. And if your whole ETL approach changes to say Azure Data Factory? I will demonstrate how to generate an Azure Data Factory pipeline from the same metadata.

##Title: A Self-Tuning Fill Factor Technique for SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever created an index and wondered what to specify for fill factor?  Usually I’ve never ever given it a worry and just left it at the default value = 0 (actually this is a synonym for 100).  But recently I’ve stumbled on a technique that will determine a “near” optimum fill factor value for every index in a database.  I say “near” because it won’t always derive the perfect fill factor, but will get you close.  We will look closely at the TSQL for this technique to see how the proof of concept was developed for a very active OLTP database.  I’ve observed a decrease in overall database wait times of 30% after the tuning.  The tuning is continuous and allows for changes in data skew as well as evolving application interactions with the database.  IMHO this is a real break-through for making your indexes perform even better.  All code will be available for download.

**Peter Doyle**  - [https://twitter.com/thepeterdoyle](https://www.twitter.com/https://twitter.com/thepeterdoyle)
LinkedIn: [Peter Doyle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thepeterdoyle/)
On Jan 12, 2019, Peter attended his first SQL Saturday and experienced an engaging and uplifting community that encouraged everyone regularly to give back. That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work.

On Jan 12, 2019, Peter attended his first SQL Saturday and experienced an engaging and uplifting community that encouraged everyone regularly to give back. That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.

##Title: Intro to Query Store##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, we will look at the new Query Store feature in SQL Server 2016 and 2017.  Query Store tracks changes in execution plans, allowing you to easily view performance differences and revert to older plans with a few clicks of the mouse in 2016.

Then in 2017, Microsoft added wait stats per query plan and Automatic Plan Correction capabilities.  Allowing DBAs more tools to troubleshoot fires with and a way to automatically resolve issues.

In this session, we will walk through the features of Query Store, so you can understand how to use them in SQL Server 2016 and 2017.

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department.

##Title: Ethical Computing##
 
**Abstract**:
This interactive discussion on Ethical Computing will inspire you to think about the cultural, social, and legal contexts of the digital experiences we create for humanity. Computing technologies including intelligent software and hardware artifacts are increasingly integrated into most aspects of our professional, social, and private lives. Intelligent Data technologies are running well in advance of public awareness, ethical reflection and regulatory frameworks.
What will prevent the technological imperative from pushing us into places we don’t want to go?

##Title: Loading SQL Server Data with Powershell##
 
**Abstract**:
Powershell has become the defacto standard for scripting Microsoft products.  However, putting data in text files doesn’t scale.  Here I’m going to show you the ins and outs of loading data into SQL Server using Powershell for the purpose of centralizing collections.  We’re going to cover RBAR as well as bulk operations and the types of things you need to take into consideration in an enterprise setting.  This is a no holds barred session taught by an enterprise SQL Server scripting expert.  You can’t afford to miss this session if you do any level of scripting in your shop.
 
**Speaker(s):**
- Sean McCown
 
*Track and Room*: PowerShell - 1305 (PowerShell)

On Jan 12, 2019, Peter attended his first SQL Saturday and experienced an engaging and uplifting community that encouraged everyone regularly to give back. That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.

##Title: Writing Award Winning PowerShell Functions and Script Modules##
 
**Abstract**:
Transitioning from writing PowerShell one-liners and basic scripts to creating reusable PowerShell tools with advanced functions and script modules can be a daunting task and with all the different ways that you’ll find on the Internet to accomplish the same task, it can definitely seem overwhelming. During this session, I’ll demystify many of the intricacies of toolmaking while demonstrating the best practices for using parameters, parameter validation, cmdlet binding, supports should process, pipeline input, error handling, module manifests, and custom formatting.

##Title: Let it Flow:  Data Flows in Azure Data Factory##
 
**Abstract**:
Azure data factory has been the main tool for copying data from one source to another.  But it doesn't do a good job transforming the data, relying on tools like DataBricks, U-SQL or stored procedures for data transformation.  In May 2019, Microsoft made Azure Data Factory Data Flows available in public preview .  This tool, which in some ways is as powerful or more so than the SSIS equivalents makes it possible to edit the data as it comes from a source to a destination.  No more do you have to process the data to a file in order to change it in flight.

On Jan 12, 2019, Peter attended his first SQL Saturday and experienced an engaging and uplifting community that encouraged everyone regularly to give back. That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.

On Jan 12, 2019, Peter attended his first SQL Saturday and experienced an engaging and uplifting community that encouraged everyone regularly to give back. That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.

LinkedIn: [Peter Doyle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thepeterdoyle/)
On Jan 12, 2019, Peter attended his first SQL Saturday and experienced an engaging and uplifting community that encouraged everyone regularly to give back. That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.
