## Title: Hacking SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
How easy is it to hack a SQL Server? 
In this session we'll see examples on how to exploit SQL Server, modify data and take control, while at the same time not leaving a trace.
We'll start by gaining access to a SQL Server (using some "creative" ways of making man-in-the-middle attacks), escalating privileges and tampering with data at the TDS protocol level (e.g. changing your income level and reverting without a trace after payment), hacking DDM, and more. 
Most importantly, we'll also cover recommendations on how to avoid these attacks, and take a look at the pros and cons of new security features in SQL Server 2016.
This is a demo-driven session, suited for DBAs, developers and security consultants.

## Title: Exploring Dark Data with SQL Server 2016 and R [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
With the addition of R into SQL Server 2016, Microsoft have provided a few extra degrees of freedom for the standard SQL developer. You can now use the R language to wrangle, clean and collect external data, using libraries and functionality that simply wasn’t available to you before with regular T-SQL. Performing data enrichment at scale with SQL Server or even Microsoft R Server can provide extremely valuable new insights for your clients and start reaping the benefits of big data.
     
In this session, Consolidata’s Oliver Frost shows you how to develop your own application for tapping into ‘dark data’. Ollie will demonstrate how to stream live tweets, perform aggregations in R and pipe the output to a Power BI dashboard, giving you a full end-to-end experience of the importance of learning some basic R code in 2016. 
     
This session is for anyone who is new to R and is interesting expanding their skill set beyond their comfort zone in SQL Server.

## Title: Introduction to SQL Server v.Next for Linux
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft surprised a lot of people with the announcement that SQL Server is going to be released for Linux. And there we have it - preview releases available in public are regularly delivered, working great and fast.
On my session I'll show details of solution that allowed this idea to come true. We'll see how to install, use and administer Linux version of SQL Server. We'll see it working as a service and in Docker containers. I'll give you details of why the second option is really interesting, or to say it more clearly - groundbreaking.
In addition to slides you're going to see lots of terminal windows, tools that are familiar to you and new stuff as well.

## Title: Enabling Citizen Data Science with Microsoft
 
**Abstract**:
In times past, Data Science was only for those elite few with a rare combination of skills including advanced knowledge of statistics.
Microsoft has been making sure that everyone can participate in the data revolution by giving people access to predictive API’s, in-database advanced analytics and drag-and-drop predictive experiments. All thanks to SQL Server 2016 and the Cortana Intelligence Suite in Azure.
These advances have given people with less knowledge of statistics and programming the ability to become what Gartner calls citizen data scientists. Should we be worried about creating fools-with-tools or should we embrace the democratization of data science as the golden age of data? Using a combination of theory and demo’s, we explore Microsoft’s solutions to ensure democratization of data science and the possible dangers that lurk below the surface.

## Title: Machine Learning for IoT - Unpacking the blackbox
 
**Abstract**:
Devices from the IoT realm generate data in a rate and magnitude that make it practically impossible to retrieve valuable information without support of adequate AI engines. Although being one among many solutions available, Azure ML has proved to be a great balance between flexibility, usability and affordable price. But how does Azure ML compare with the other ML providers? How to choose the appropriate algorithm? Do you understand the key performance indicators and how to improve the quality of your models?
This session is about managing and understanding IoT data. Check this out and see how Azure Machine Learning could support real life problems in building IoT solutions.

## Title: Logic Apps - Data Orchestration in Azure
 
**Abstract**:
For a long time we've dreamed of full-functioned SSIS in the cloud. If you've wrestled with Data Factory, well... It's not quite there yet. Logic Apps fills a huge gap in the Azure story and if you've not tried it yet - you should.

Logic Apps provides control-flow style functionality and can orchestrate data from a huge range of common sources. Want to scrape twitter, perform sentiment analysis and write to PowerBI? Its now possible with zero coding.

This session will introduce Logic Apps  how it fits into the Modern Azure Warehouse then demonstrate building a twitter scraper step by step, demonstrating the process of building, deploying and debugging an app.

## Title: Creating data-driven serverless apps with Azure Functions
 
**Abstract**:
We already know that cloud provides us with a way to control the amount of resources provisioned based on app load, scale them up and down. But what if I will say that there is a way to create your app, host it in the cloud and make it ready to respond at your call, but if you will have zero load during a month it will cost you nothing? Try to imagine that you will pay not for fixed amount of CPU and RAM, but for a number of function calls and amount of CPU time consumed to execute them. In this scenario you do not have a dedicated virtual machine, but you have an abstract web farm, which consists of 100500 servers and each of them is able to execute your code. In this case we do not have a server, neither physical nor virtual, we have a platform which can scale from zero to infinite in a few seconds. On top of that you can use your favorite language - C#, F#, Java, PHP, Python, Node.JS, PowerShell, Bash, etc.

## Title: State-of-the-Art Machine Learning Algorithms in R from Microsoft
 
**Abstract**:
Do you fancy learning regression and classification in one hour? 
We will start with linear regression, simple but powerful machine learning algorithm. With it you will learn about correlation coefficient, loss function, optimization algorithms and regularization. At the end of this section we will built a ML model using Fast linear model with Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent (SDCA) optimization.
Next step is get to know artificial neural networks, their architecture, activation functions and backpropagation algorithm. This allows us to build a (better?) model using rxNeuralNet and N#.
Evaluation metrics for regression models will conclude first part of the session.
In the second part we will use almost the same ML algorithms for classification — the difference is that Logistic regression will replace Linear regression. Finally we will learn about Evaluation metrics for classification models, which allows us to pick the very best model for problems we are going to solve together.

## Title: From SQL to R – Leverage Your T-SQL Knowledge to Learn R
 
**Abstract**:
You are already familiar with T-SQL and are eager to learn R but do not know, where to start? Start from what you already know: T-SQL. Both languages have many things in common on some levels, but are very different on others. This session will kick you off to the new language by using analogies from T-SQL. You will learn how to write your first R-scripts, make usage of packages and will leave this session with a basic understanding of typical use-cases of R and how to integrate that into your existing environment with SQL Server.

## Title: Database Continuous Delivery on the Microsoft Platform
 
**Abstract**:
A look at the state of the art in database continuous delivery using SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT), Visual Studio Team Services(VSTS), and VSTS Release Management.

The features provided by platforms such as TFS and VSTS have been widely adopted by application developers in support of modern software development practices such as continuous delivery.

In the world of database development, adoption has been much slower, due to a number of organisational and technical considerations.

This session will discuss some of the challenges associated with database continuous delivery, and the ways in which Visual Studio, SQL Server Data Tools and Visual Studio Team Services can help to improve delivery of SQL Server databases.

## Title: Anomaly Detection
 
**Abstract**:
Anomaly detection is one of the most advanced data mining and machine learning tasks. There are many statistical procedures and data mining algorithms that can be used for it, including Expectation-Maximization Clustering, and Principal Component Analysis. In this session, you will learn through presentation and demos how to detect the low quality data areas with some basic statistics and with advanced algorithms. You will see how you can use T-SQL queries, R code in SQL Server, SSAS Data Mining, and Azure ML for this complex task.

## Title: GDPR compliant by design
 
**Abstract**:
From 25 May 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will affect every organisation that processes EU residents’ personally identifiable information (PII). The GDPR contains requirements that systems and processes must consider compliance with the principles of data protection.
The essence of privacy by design is that privacy in a service or product is taken into account not only at the point of delivery, but from the inception of the product concept.
There is also a requirement that controllers should only collect data necessary to fulfil specific purposes, discarding it when it is no longer required, to protect data subject rights.

This presentation provides a breakdown of the key provisions introduced by the new law, which every organisation must be aware of

## Title: Adaptive Query Processing in SQL Server 2017
 
**Abstract**:
An improvement of cardinality estimation is something we try to find in every next version of SQL Server. Even with all the improvements the SQL Server 2014 Query Processor gained, we still need to deal with Hash and Sort Warnings, extremely high or low Memory grants, or the well-known User Defined Functions performance issues. That’s why we are so existed to find the new wave of adaptive query processing improvements to handle the more intractable cardinality estimation issues that often result in a poor query performance. Find out how the new wave of adaptive query processing improvements to handle the more intractable cardinality estimation issues that often result in a poor query performance.

## Title: Power BI: Performance Tips  Tricks
 
**Abstract**:
Thanks to the rapid, community-driven release cycle, Microsoft Power BI has caught and overtaken many visualisation tools and now sits alongside Tableau at the top of the Gartner Magic Quadrant for 2017. It is fast becoming the first-choice reporting tool for both small and large organisations. 

However, as with all reporting tools, if the underlying data model is badly designed or custom measures/calculations are poorly written, performance can really suffer. Whether you are designing the front-end for a carefully crafted warehouse, or performing an ad-hoc analysis exercise, you can follow some best practice advice to ensure you’re getting the best out of your reports.

This 1 hour session will range from quick development wins to more strategic, enterprise considerations.  The session also aims to explain ad-hoc transformations within the Query Editor and demonstrates best practices for encouraging Query Folding.  Designed for all levels of Power BI expertise.

## Title: How GDPR affect most common DBA maintenance tasks
 
**Abstract**:
The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) suggests penalties for those companies and organizations which do not comply with the directive. Fines can go as high as 4% of annual global revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater. That's why everybody from C-level management to regular DBA is crucial to enforce compliance with the new data protection rules and for this very reason data maintenance tasks become absolutely obligatory and if a legal entity has skipped them, from now on it is not going to be possible.
In this session, based on our experience, we will speak about the most important DBA maintenance tasks you need to perform to keep your databases GDPR compliant.
Session is suitable for beginner DBAs and Developers.

## Title: I am a DBA! "What's next"?
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, we will discuss where to start when you get your job as a DBA. What are the first steps you need to do to discover and arrange the environment for which you are responsible. How to answer questions like: How many databases do you have on each server? How big are they? What they are used for and how many of them are critical? Do you need backups and do you have such, Etc. There are many questions you got from the day 1, but where to start is always the key to not get panicked. The goal of this session is to help you perform your first steps in a DBA job, especially when you get into a situation with only one Excel spreadsheet containing your servers’ list.

**Gilberto Zampatti**
 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…
