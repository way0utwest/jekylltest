## Title: Processing Flat Files with SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
When doing data integration, a common requirement is to work with flat files, whether for importing data into a system from an external source, or to export it to provide to other systems. SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) supports flat files, but there can be a number of challenges when working with them. This is particularly true if your flat files have multiple data formats contained in a single file, the data has complex formatting, or the files have inconsistent formatting. This session will help you to be more efficient when working with these types of files. You’ll learn to handle missing delimiters in the files, and parsing files that have multiple data formats.

## Title: Table Partitioning: Evaluation, Planning, Options
 
**Abstract**:
Does SQL Server's table partitioning feature offer performance improvements, manageability benefits, or both? Table partitioning is a significant investment: it's important to understand many aspects of the feature to evaluate where it might be useful to applications. This session will cover basic concepts of table partitioning. We'll discuss where the feature can be applied, its benefits, and changes that partitioning may require to existing database schema. Special considerations for management of partitioned tables will be discussed, as well as potential changes to query optimization and plans. New SQL 2008 R2 features for partitioning will be included in the discussion.

## Title: Partitioning in SQL Server 2005/2008
 
**Abstract**:
Starting with SQL Server 2005, Microsoft has made a significant effort to truly streamline partitioning data to be on par with industry leading databases like Oracle. The potential was not fully harnessed by the SQL Server community primarily due to the lack of any user interface associated with partitioning and due to lack of cohesive documentation. For many, Kimberly Tripp’s white paper on “Partitioned Tables and Indexes in SQL Server 2005” is generally regarded as a primary guiding source that bridges the void in MS documentation. Come and get a quick start on partitioning. It is simple and efficient. Manageability and performance come part and parcel.

## Title: SQL and SEO - the FUZION of data and marketing
 
**Abstract**:
Bringing marketing together with technology is a fine art that involves high tech tools, real life solutions, and most important human buy-in from the marketing and IT departments. This lecture will delve into the use of the latest SQL Server 2005 and SQL Server 2008 technologies including recursive common table expressions (CTE), hierarchical data models, and CLR stored procedures for the IT side of the house while also delving into the use of analytics, webmaster monitoring tools, web marketing tactics and search engine optimization techniques for the more marketing minded. Neither SQL nor SEO are four letter words and they go together perfectly! So too can your IT and marketing departments as you tackle the new age of IT Marketing.

## Title: Design and Implement BI Like Edison!
 
**Abstract**:
As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor. In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence solutions.

## Title: Data Files and Transaction Logs – Beyond the GUIs 
 
**Abstract**:
Performance of SQL Server poor?  One cause may have been that starting file size that you didn't think was important because it will auto-grow. Why is auto-grow bad? Why shouldn't files be auto-shrunk? Why keep that free space in the files?  Explore the physical structure of a database, how table structure effects use of memory and key mistakes to avoid. Additionally, dive into the transaction log process - VLFs, auto-recovery and lock escalation. Solid foundation for Programmers and Administrators!

## Title: Automate Policy-Based Management using PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
The Policy-Based Management feature in SQL Server 2008 provides a great way to ensure your systems are configured consistently and correctly, but it can be tedious to implement on each server in your environment.  PowerShell scripts allow you to automate the implementation of your policies so you can focus on more important problems.  This session will walk you through how PBM works, how to define your policies in PowerShell, and how to set up Agent jobs to evaluate those policies regularly to let you know when you need to take action.
