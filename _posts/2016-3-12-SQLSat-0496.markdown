## Title: Using Power BI with my DBA Database
 
**Abstract**:
Every good DBA should have a DBA database. A place to store information about all of their instances and databases. They should automatically gather information into that database. They are also often required to query that information to answer questions from other technical teams, Project Managers, Client Account managers, Compliance Teams, Auditors, Directors In this session I will talk about the way that I automate the gathering of this information and also how I use Power BI to be able to allow people to self serve answers to their own questions and remove some load from the DBA team. I am no BI expert so this session is aimed at DBAs who want to be able to show information using the latest tools rather than BI professionals

## Title: From SSMS to SSDT why and how to move your SQL database development to SSDT
 
**Abstract**:
SSMS is the love child of what was Query Analyzer and Enterprise Manager and has ever since been used as the dev tool of choice for people creating and modifying database schemas and code. Whilst SSMS is a really good management tool it is not suited to modern development. Instead Microsoft has created SSDT (SQL Server Data Tools) which has had a lot of attention from Microsoft in the last few years which means that it is now ready for us to use full time.

We will cover:

* How to get your databases into SSDT and critically how to get them to compile correctly.
* A tour of the SSDT features that show how T-SQL development is actually easier and how SSDT makes you more productive
* The build  deployment process so you can start concentrating on writing useful code instead of upgrade and release scripts.

If you write, debug or modify SQL Server database code and haven't yet started using SSDT full time then this session will help you get started and be productive quickly.

## Title: You don't need Enterprise Edition to do that!
 
**Abstract**:
The most coveted features of SQL Server are made available in Enterprise Edition and are sometimes released into Standard Edition a few years later. This often leaves a vast group of users who "window shop" the latest and greatest features and return to the office wishing they never saw those features presented. This session will show you how you can achieve the same, or at least a similar, outcome to some of those features without having to fork out for Enterprise Edition licenses or breaking any license agreements. You will leave the session with a set of solution concepts covering Partitioning, Data Compression and High Availability that you can build upon or extend and maybe save you and your company a nice pile of cash.

## Title: A first look at the Azure Data Lake Analytics service
 
**Abstract**:
Do you want to be able to query huge amounts of data at cloud scale on a distributed infrastructure that is capable of scaling with your needs?
Do you want to use a language that is both familiar and powerful to extract valuable insights from your data?
If the answer to both of these questions is "yes" then Data Lake is definitely something you should be looking at.
In this session we will look at the Data Lake analytics service, a service capable of handling queries against data of any size instantly simply by requesting more compute for each query.  U-SQL is a query language that blends the declarative nature of SQL with the expressive power of C#.  Visualisations of your U-SQL jobs let you see how your code runs at scale.
Come to this session to see why people are talking about this new offering from Microsoft and see some of the problems it solves

## Title: Re-architecting your old-school database to maximize Azure cloud options
 
**Abstract**:
The quickest way to migrate your on-premises OLTP database to Azure is to simply "Lift  Shift".
You create a vm in Azure and size it to match your local system and move your database into it.
This might not be the most cost effective way though and also, you still have to do all the
database maintenance yourself.
In this session we will investigate how we could use more of the cloud features like SQL Database, Redis Cache, Search, etc. in order to truly scale
our system. And we'll see if this increases or lowers the total cost of ownership.
This excercise is about an OLTP system but we will also look at how it affects loading our DWH from this new setup.

## Title: Dive into SSISDB Catalog using Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
If you have worked with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) 2012 or above for few years then you already familiar with SSIS Catalog reports. SSISDB Catalog reports - help us to monitor projects, which you've deployed to the server. By using these reports, we can quickly find information related to executions, logging and other interesting things with few mouse clicks.

However, have you ever wondered how to design an SSIS Project so we can take maximum benefit of SSISDB Catalog?  How to troubleshoot SSIS Project executions from the Catalog? How to navigate your way around the built-in catalog reports? How to design a dashboard with SSIDB Catalog data? This session will focus on these scenarios by diving into SSISDB catalog views using PowerBI.

## Title: Dealing With Errors in SSIS 
 
**Abstract**:
Errors can occur anywhere within an SSIS package and the cause and error message can be somewhat cryptic. This session focuses on identifying error causes and handling them dynamically and proactively. The means of dealing with errors is defined by where the error occurs and we will cover error handling in control flow, data flow, and script tasks in great detail. 

You will learn:
•To identify the different error handling methods in control flow, data flow, and script tasks 
•Be able to utilize event handlers to proactively handle errors

## Title: Estimation and Statistics : The Basis of query optimization
 
**Abstract**:
At the heart of SQL Server is the cost based optimizer.  Stop and think about that a minute, it attempts to give the “best plan” based on the cost of the work undertaken.  How does it know the cost of the work before its done the work ? This isn’t a conundrum, it doesn’t.  It estimates!  How does it estimate ? That is statistics.
This will be a deep dive into how the optimizer makes its decisions to give you a plan, the things that can go wrong and how you can have influence over these choices.

## Title: Responding to Extended Events in near real-time
 
**Abstract**:
Extended Events provide deep insight into SQL Server's behavior and allow us to gather information not available by other means. However, compared to other technologies such as SQL Trace and Event Notifications, a way to react to the events as soon as they happen seems to be lacking.

In this session we will see how the Extended Events streaming API can be used to process events in a near real-time fashion. We will demonstrate how this technology enables new possibilities to solve real world problems, such as capturing and notifying deadlocks or blocking sessions.
