##Title: Implementing an SSIS Framework and enforcing SSIS Patterns (with Biml).##
 
**Abstract**:
Let's use Biml to automate the implementation of a standard, pattern-based SSIS Framework.  I.e.  Logging, error handling, etc.  Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) is great at automating the creation of SSIS packages.  With Biml we can generate a template package that implements a standard SSIS framework.  In this fast-paced session, we will create the tables and load some metadata, write the Biml to implement logging and error handling, and generate some packages that implement our standard framework.  In this session, you don't need to know Biml, but some familiarity with XML, TSQL or C# will help.  By the end of this session, you will know how to use Biml to automatically generate packages that implement a simple SSIS Framework with Audit Logging and Error Handling.

##Title: I/O Tuning 101##
 
**Abstract**:
One of the most common problems I have encountered as a DBA is the complaints from users that a particular query is slow, just one query.  Many times one that used to run in acceptable time, but that over time has slowed down substantially.

In this session we will show some of the causes for this, with emphasis on I/O requests being too high for the query.  

First part of the session will explain how to find these numbers, looking at a few queries with some major performance issues, including explaining why they have a problem.

The second part will focus on how to reduce I/O requests.

All of this can be done without the need for any 3rd party tools, all within the scope of what is available to SQL Server, all versions, all editions, including Azure.

##Title: DevOps for the DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps came out of the Agile movement and the idea that operations needed to be part of the solution for agile development to be successful.  The DBA was often the most resilient and robust member of the operations team and most resistant to change.  This mentality was essential to the protection of company’s critical production data.

This session discusses common database challenges and how they can be minimized or solved with newer DevOps practices without impacting the DBAs “safe zone”.  We’ll discuss how to use these vital skills and motivate everyone towards solutions for more success in agile development environments. Development, testing, provisioning, patching, upgrading and managing will become easier with agile tools, virtualization and collaboration.  
The take-aways from this session are to embrace DevOps basics with a “DBA twist” such as:
•	Develop, Rinse, Repeat
•	Test Until Your Five Year Old Can Do It
•	Human Intervention Creates Human Error- Automate EVERYTHING.

##Title: Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent##
 
**Abstract**:
The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT, and Prod is a challenge whether on-premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.

##Title: Using Kafka for Real-Time Data Ingestion with .NET##
 
**Abstract**:
Remember that first time you saw Service Broker and thought of all the great things you could do with it? Remember when you actually tried Service Broker and found all the limitations and pain points? Enter Apache Kafka. Apache Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system which can scale out to handle millions of messages per second and support a distributed, microservices-oriented architecture. In this talk, we will cover the basics of this powerful system, including general architectural and design principles. We will also build a .NET project which uses Kafka to produce and consume messages quickly and efficiently.

##Title: How to Manage Very Large Databases with SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
Are you experiencing challenges managing Very Large Databases (VLDBs), or anticipate challenges do to future growth? In this session, I will provide practical advice on managing very large databases (databases > 1TB) with SQL server, focusing on common problem areas for new and experienced DBAs alike. These problem areas include index maintenance, integrity checks, archival, backups, and restores. We will look at new features available in SQL Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017 which make managing large databases easier, and we will explore some of the challenges and opportunities of managing large databases using SQL Server 2017 on Linux.

##Title: The Art and Science of Designing a Mission Critical SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
When asked to design a critical database system, too many people pick an HA feature and then design the solution around it. This usually results in a costly and disappointing design. 
This session will show you the five basic archetypes for mission critical database systems and how to select the right features from SQL Server to implement each design. Along the way you’ll hear some best practices, tips, and real world advice for choosing between features like Availability Groups and clustered instances of SQL Server, as well as the history of some of the more interesting and less often used availability features. You will also get a glimpse of how some of the largest mission critical systems running on the Microsoft platform are created using a distributed model where redundancy replaces failover.
While you may not be able to revisit your current designs right away, what you learn will improve how you approach thinking about making a system as fail-proof as it can be.

##Title: Secrets of the Query Optimizer Revealed Using Trace Flag 86xx##
 
**Abstract**:
You already know a thing or two about tuning a SQL query on Microsoft SQL Server. You can read an execution plan and know the most significant red flags to look for. And you have also learned how to track the most important metrics revealed by features like the SET STATISTICS. But you want to take it up another level! 

First, we will examine using undocumented trace flags to look at the steps of parsing, binding, and query optimization. Second, we will show how SQL Server builds internal memo structures and it interrogates the heuristics of the optimizer search space. Finally, we will discuss a secret trace flag that gives the optimizer more time to produce alternative execution plans for queries that push the boundaries of extreme database processing.

##Title: Environmental SQL Server Troubleshooting##
 
**Abstract**:
When called in to diagnose a performance issue what are the 1st things you review? Many DBAs and developers make the mistake of diving straight into the code looking for an answer. However, often times the solution is not in the code but rather in the overall environment. Environmental troubleshooting is often a quick and overlooked method for discovering and configuring SQL Server to perform at a higher level without the need for application change controls.

In this session we will discuss both performance pitfalls and optimizations that can be made to the system outside of code changes. We will diagnose configurations commonly misapplied and review best practices in SQL Server, Windows Server, and VMware!

##Title: Solving Real World DevOps Problems - Customer success stories (90 min)##
 
**Abstract**:
In a cloud-first world, DB DevOps are critical, not only from a functional perspective but even more from both scalability of operations and availability perspectives. Here are some of the challenges faced by SaaS ISVs and enterprises using Azure SQL DB or SQL Server: - How do you minimize downtime due to database schema changes? - How do you deploy at scale across hundreds or thousands of databases? - How do you ensure end-to-end security at the DB layer regardless of the type of the query? SQL Server offers some great DB DevOps capabilities with SSDT and SQLPackage. 
Underlying these are the SQLDOM parser and the DACFX libraries. Iwill showcase the power of these libraries by using some real-world use cases (with demos!), each of which was encountered in direct customer engagement by the SQLCAT team and field counterpart.

##Title: Where Should My Data Live (and Why)?##
 
**Abstract**:
Long gone are the days where the only architecture decision you had to make when scaling an environment was deciding which part of the datacenter would store your new server. There is a dizzying array of options available in the SQL Server and Azure ecosystems and those are evolving by the day. Is “the cloud” a fad? Are private datacenters a thing of the past? Could both questions have a kernel of truth in them? In this session I will go over real world scenarios and walk you through real world solutions that utilize your datacenter, cloud providers, and everything in between to keep your data highly available and your customers happy. This is a shorter preview version of this talk that I'll be presenting at PASS Summit 2017.

##Title: Using Powershell to Document SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
Most DBAs use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects. Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exported because they live at the server level, above the database. Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for Disaster Recovery purposes. Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, Server Triggers and much more

##Title: Architecting a Data Lake to Modernize Your Data Warehouse##
 
**Abstract**:
This full-day session will focus on principles for designing and implementing a data lake. There will be a mix of concepts, lessons learned, and technical implementation details. During the session we will build a data lake from the ground up, populate it, organize it, secure it, integrate it with a data warehouse via logical constructs, and query the data. You will leave this session with an understanding of the benefits and challenges of a multi-platform analytics/DW/BI environment, as well as recommendations for how to get started.

Target audience:

Technologists who are considering using a data lake. No data lake experience is required. However, familiarity with SQL Server and data warehousing is suggested, as the scenarios discussed will primarily focus on extending functionality and improving agility for an existing data warehouse.

You will learn in this session:

    Scenarios and use cases for expanding an analytics/DW/BI environment into a multi-platform environment

##Title: Introduction to Ensemble Modeling##
 
**Abstract**:
Data vault is a compelling architecture for an enterprise data warehouse using SQL Server. We will review the basics about enterprise data warehouse design, introduce you to the data vault architecture and discuss how you can leverage BI features of SQL Server to help make your data warehouse solution provide maximum value to your users. We will walk through example data models to help highlight why data vault architecture facilitates traceability, auditability and scalability. Additionally we will cover implementation advantages which can facilitate agile development, strategies to load massive amounts of data in parallel, how to transition the data warehouse to a system of record, how to easily automate loading using BIML because of strictly naming rules and conventions, and finally how to support the Master Data Management needs of the organization.

##Title: 5 Minute No Sweat SQL Security Audits##
 
**Abstract**:
Security audits such as PCI, STIG, or HIPAA, are important and can be complicated. Depending on the requirements it may take considerable time to gather the information you will need.
In this session, you will get scripts that I use for compliance audits that help to collect the information required for many different audits quickly. Even when you have multiple SQL Servers, you can quickly and easily identify where to focus your efforts to ensure you pass security audits. Through demonstration and discussion of what and why certain items get reviewed you will leave with a better understanding of how to be compliant within you SQL Server environment.

##Title: Demystifying Data Compression##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2016 SP1 makes data compression available in all editions. Data compression can reduce storage costs, and provide a performance boost—and now compression is available without the added cost of Enterprise Edition. Whether you are a developer or a DBA, it's important to know how to use compression to save money and improve speed.

Come learn about how data compression actually works, the differences between ROW and PAGE compression, and learn how to pick the best compression level for your data. This session will cover the details of the compression algorithms, and the costs and benefits associated with each type of compression. 

By the end of this session, you'll have a better idea of how the different compression algorithms work, when compression is the right solution, as well as what type of compression to use.

Early on, he tried using PowerShell and .Net to automate BI Development. Later those efforts turned to Biml.  After founding a startup six years ago, he finds himself a data platform consultant, designing and guiding other professionals to build highly automated enterprise solutions.  Today, he is a Biml Hero candidate and is awaiting the final approval for the award.

##Title: Finding more space for your tight environment.##
 
**Abstract**:
If you do not have enough space in your hard disk and do not want buy more space, one way to get more space is compress the tables and also do some house keeping.

I will use T-SQL script to generate script to compress each tables and release the free space by shrinking the datafiles.
And in the final I will defragment the indexes and update the statistics, since shrink datafile is not fragmentation aware task.

##Title: Build Your Extract Packages Automatically!##
 
**Abstract**:
Automating extract packages is trivial, you simply use INFORMATION_SCHEMA.  The problem is not all your data sources have easy to read metadata like SQL Server.  How do you create usable metadata from these sources? In this hour, I’ll show you how easy it is to make an educated guess on the schema of flat files and other “semi-structured” data sources.  

With that schema, automatically generating your extract package is a matter of seconds!  Join me while I share my interrogator project with you and start saving hours at work today!

##Title: Measure Performance Through Baselines##
 
**Abstract**:
You get a ticket or email indicating there is a problem with the database and are asked to review.  How do you know there is a problem?  Baselines.  Without a set known measurements to compare against it will be impossible to know whether your change is helping.  This session reviews the process for collecting information about your SQL Server so you can compare current processes with historical processes.  Once you understand the current behavior of the database, you can measure the impact of any change.  This session will review ways to set up the collection of performance information and make it available for review later.

##Title: Making Your List and Checking It Twice: Introduction to unit testing with tSQLt##
 
**Abstract**:
Unit testing allows database code to be consistently tested during the development process, but it can be challenging to get unit testing setup for database development. This session will give an overview on the purpose of unit testing, the installation of the tSQLt framework, and the design of unit tests. I will use general concepts of test driven design to create and run unit tests to confirm that objects exist and to test single and multiple test cases. Learn how to implement unit testing in a development environment and create and run your own units tests.

##Title: A Tour of Cloud Data Platforms as a Service##
 
**Abstract**:
With the proliferation of SQL, NoSQL and Big Data databases, organizations can now target specific fit-for-purpose database platforms that align with their particular application requirements regarding scalability, elasticity, functionality and manageability. Platform as a Service offerings make this even easier now, enabling developers to roll out their own database infrastructure in minutes with minimal management overhead. However, this same amount of flexibility also comes with the challenges of picking the right tool, on the right provider and with the proper expectations.

##Title: ARMed for Azure##
 
**Abstract**:
The Azure Resource Model (ARM) enables Azure infrastructure automation for both IaaS and PaaS deployments.  Using Visual Studio as a management tool enables repeatable, automated, source controlled deployments for test and development environments, enabling true DevOps practices for all aspects of pre-production systems.  In this session, I will demonstrate, explain, and deploy a IaaS/PaaS hybrid environment (SQL and BI stack elements) using ARM templates, Visual Studio, source control integration, and PowerShell scripts.

##Title: Faster SSIS##
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wonder why SSIS runs so slow? Watch SSIS author Andy Leonard as he runs test loads using sample and real-world data and shows you how to tune SQL Server 2016 Integration Services (SSIS 2016) packages.

We'll start by experimenting with SSIS design patterns to improve performance loading AdventureWorks data. We will implement different change detection patterns and compare execution performance for each. Then, we'll explain a Data Flow Task's bottleneck when loading binary large objects - or Blobs. 

Finally, we'll demonstrate a design pattern that uses a Script Component in a Data Flow to boost load performance to MySql, whether on-premises or in the cloud.

##Title: Table Partitioning 101##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have large tables you can’t delete old data from or perform maintenance on?  Then this may be for you! Table Partitioning 101 will make an introduction to table partitioning through the GUI and a code based approach.  The session will be a discussion about how to make it work and will include: creating partitioned tables, partition schemes, left vs. right facing partition functions and how to do a basic switch operation.  A small deep dive about how to find out which partition your data is in and what exactly does it mean for an index to be “aligned” will also be discussed.

20+ years of experience with SQL Server, from version 6.0 to 2017.  Funnily enough, the only certification I have is on SQL 2012, the one version I have never used.
Mostly worked at medium sized companies, by choice.  Was a consultant for 6+ years, working on anything from facility security systems, background checks, retail PoS systems, to major financial systems.
Passion for performance, and teaching people easy ways to better SQL performance.
