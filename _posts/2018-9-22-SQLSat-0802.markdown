## Title: Impostor Syndrome: Are You Faking It  Will they Find Out?
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever thought to yourself  “All these people think I’m smarter than I really am" or "I really don’t know what I’m doing, they're going to figure out I'm a fraud!”  If yes, then you suffer from the Impostor Syndrome. And despite all the accomplishments, awards and accolades, you still doubt yourself. It’s rampant in the modern day tech workplace, and the fear will make you shrink back from opportunities. You dismiss praise. You overcompensate by working harder, being charming and demanding perfection from yourself. What would happen if you were released from this bondage, and kicked your impostor to the curb? In this session, learn 3 powerful techniques that can help to improve your confidence and silent that annoying voice in your head!

## Title: Save Time and Resources - Performance Tuning Strategies
 
**Abstract**:
We all know that execution plans and indexes are important pieces to performance tuning jobs. However, they are definitely not the only tools in the toolbox. This session will take a more high-level, holistic, approach to performance tuning jobs and their components. We will talk about where to start, how to identify problem areas, and many ways to improve performance. Many of the topics covered in the presentation come from real-world situations I've encountered. One example describes how we stopped a job after 13 hours and were able to tune it down to 8 minutes. Adding additional hardware is not always an option or the answer. Do more with what you have and tune your jobs. I'll show you how.

## Title: SQL Server Then and Now: Changing the State of Long-held Beliefs
 
**Abstract**:
We’ve all heard the rules for SQL Server like separate your data from your log, watch for a disk queue length over 2, and a low Page Life Expectancy always means memory pressure. All of these used to be true, but on today’s hardware and SQL Server versions – they are dangerously outdated. In this session, we will take on a bunch of these old “givens” of SQL Server that everybody has heard and followed, the underlying technological reasons they were true then, how today’s technology has rendered them obsolete, and what the new rules are that you need to know. So whether you are one of the old guard looking to refresh your set of working SQL Server rules or a member of the up-and-comers looking for the facts to win over the old guard, this session is for you.

## Title: The Art and Science of Designing a Mission Critical SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
When asked to design a critical database system, too many people pick an HA feature and then design the solution around it. This usually results in a costly and disappointing design. 
This session will show you the five basic archetypes for mission critical database systems and how to select the right features from SQL Server to implement each design. Along the way you’ll hear some best practices, tips, and real world advice for choosing between features like Availability Groups and clustered instances of SQL Server, as well as the history of some of the more interesting and less often used availability features. You will also get a glimpse of how some of the largest mission critical systems running on the Microsoft platform are created using a distributed model where redundancy replaces failover.
While you may not be able to revisit your current designs right away, what you learn will improve how you approach thinking about making a system as fail-proof as it can be.

## Title: What just happened? Creating your own real-time dashboard with Grafana, Influx, and Telegraf.
 
**Abstract**:
Like many of you, I've been fortunate enough to work in places where the budgets were non-existent, the systems were always crashing, and what tools we did have, were good for some, not all.  For those fighting fires and wearing multiple hats, you're used to, but still scared of "hey, what just happened?"    

In this session, I'll show you how to install, configure, and build your own dashboard with Grafana, and utilize InfluxDB and Telegraf, which I believe will help you fight your fires better than before.  Going past just monitoring your SQL Server, we'll also use some Powershell and SQL Server Agent Jobs to track our custom business KPIs, and configure some alerting to send us Slack notifications.

## Title: Database Corruption! Preventing Disaster to your Database.
 
**Abstract**:
Every DBA should know about database corruption because it can be a resume generating event. A corrupt database can ruin your day, affect system stability, lead to unnecessary downtime, and possibly data loss. 

In this presentation we will explore database corruption, learn how to diagnose, and see what we can do to fix it. We will discuss the causes, dispel some myths, and learn what questions to ask. After this, we dive into discovering the root cause and putting a plan in place to stop it in the future. Demos will illustrate diagnosing, troubleshooting, and fixing database corruption. Prepare to break a database and go through the steps to return it back to a usable state. 

Beginners will benefit along with others who may one day find themselves with a corrupt database. By the end of the session, you will have the tools and understanding necessary to take corrective action and prevent your databases from corruption!

## Title: Environmental SQL Server Troubleshooting
 
**Abstract**:
When called in to diagnose a performance issue what are the 1st things you review? Many DBAs and developers make the mistake of diving straight into the code looking for an answer. However, often times the solution is not in the code but rather in the overall environment. Environmental troubleshooting is often a quick and overlooked method for discovering and configuring SQL Server to perform at a higher level without the need for application change controls.

In this session we will discuss both performance pitfalls and optimizations that can be made to the system outside of code changes. We will diagnose configurations commonly misapplied and review best practices in SQL Server, Windows Server, and VMware!

## Title: Dive into the Query Optimizer - Undocumented Insight
 
**Abstract**:
This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.

## Title: SSIS Project Deployment: The T-SQL Way
 
**Abstract**:
Do you deploy SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) Projects using the Integration Services Deployment Wizard? If you're looking for a repeatable deployment method that can be source controlled, there's another way...the T-SQL way! In this session, you will see a demonstration of T-SQL script deployment of SSIS projects, using stored procedures in the SSISDB database. You'll learn how to query the SSIS catalog to find your project configurations so they can be captured and source controlled. Take control of your SSIS deployments...the T-SQL way!


Prerequisites:
You should have previous experience with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) package deployment and/or development.

## Title: Delivering Business Value Faster
 
**Abstract**:
Every team’s goal is to deliver business value faster, the question is how do you do that? If you’re a small shop with 1 or 2 developers then writing script in test and then running them production may be okay, but for a larger team that leads to problems. Using continuous integration (CI) and deployment techniques you can make small incremental changes which then set off a chain of automation steps that validates the new code. After automated validation, the code changes are ready for any additional User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and staging environments. During this session, you will learn how to manage database schema changes in a dynamic environment and deliver code to production by utilizing continuous integration and certain development techniques in minutes with minimal risk.

## Title: Introduction to SQL Server Reporting Services
 
**Abstract**:
This session will cover the basics of developing, publishing and using SQL Server Reporting Services. You will learn all the steps needed to get started from connecting to the data source, creating data sets through putting the data on the page and publishing the report to the report server. See how easy SSRS is to use and how powerful it can be. The demo will be using SSRS 2016 but the concepts covered are applicable to any version of SQL Server. 
The session will also include: 
A tour of a wide variety of report examples including interactive graphical dashboards that you can do in SSRS, even in older versions. 
A comprehensive discussion of design elements to include and avoid when creating reports. 
Report printing and export considerations for optimal output depending on rendering format.
You will leave this session able to return to the office and present meaningful data to your end users with minimal time and effort with easy to use and powerful BI tool that you already own.

## Title: CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming
 
**Abstract**:
This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.

## Title: Use SQL Server 2017 Features in Your Older SQL Server Versions
 
**Abstract**:
Have you read about the amazing new SQL Server 2017 features, but your work is still stuck using SQL Server 2012 or older? Maybe even 2005? Would using Python or R to make it easier to manipulate and analyze your data ? 
Would temporal tables be an easy solution? Maybe In-Memory Tables or Columnstore Indexes would give you a performance boost?

By thinking outside of the box and applying a little process massaging, we can actually do all this inside of the free SQL Server Express edition. The limits and features of this edition have been greatly increased, you just need to consider it. Because Express is still SQL Server, it easily connects to your existing SQL Server Standard and Enterprise versions that are doing the main workload. We're just partitioning off part of the workflow.

Come see examples of incorporating all these features into your workload to increase performance, and to stop limiting your knowledge to yesterday's tech.

## Title: Reporting Services 2016: New Features  Smart Migration Strategy
 
**Abstract**:
With the release of SQL Server 2016, Reporting Services finally got some love!  In this session, you will get an overview of some of the new features and functionality:  A look at the new Report Manager interface, Mobile reports, KPIs and the new control we have over the placement of parameters.  We will also look at the new Mobile Report Publisher app and see how easy it is to create mobile reports.  The session will cover tips for a smart migration to 2016.

The session will then dive into how to use the data in the ReportServer database tables to see which reports in your environment are being used and how well they are performing.  With this understanding you can determine which reports, data sets and data sources to migrate to a new 2016 installation.  Come see how to leverage PowerShell to extract the reports from the database, instead of having to download them from Report Manager, to facilitate an easy migration to a new SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services implementation.

## Title: A Week in the Life of a Data Scientist
 
**Abstract**:
Predictive modeling contains six stages of analysis according to the Cross Industry Standard Process Model for Data Mining (CRISP-DM). I will break this down into three primary tasks for predictive modelers including preparing data, building models, and explaining results. 

Data preparation often requires skills in SQL, python, or other languages to be able to pull data out of data stores and convert the normalized data into flattened data that the algorithms can use to build models

Modeling requires a qualitative (if not quantitative) understanding of the algorithms, including mathematics or statistics, in order to build effectively. 

Finally, modelers should know how to explain the results of their findings to other analysts and to decision-makers and stakeholders.

The session will walk through the building of a predictive model for a retail application: predicting the days to next purchase propensity model.

## Title: Foundations of a Data Driven Organization
 
**Abstract**:
What is Data Driven? You might have heard someone at your organization say you need to be more data driven, but what does it mean? How does your organization need to change to be able to support being data driven?

As you might imagine it is a little bit more complicated that just saying the words or putting together a few charts. This session will talk about the fundamental things that you need to think about to move to being more data driven. It is a combination of people, process, policy and technology. This session will give you a lot to think about how to apply the principles of being data applies to your company.

## Title: SQL Security, Encryption,  Compliance
 
**Abstract**:
In today's regulatory environment, expertise in security and compliance are table stakes in the DBA job market.  Industries that manage customer data (finance, health care, etc.) have strict protocols required by law and enforced by audits, which are kind of like a month-long root canal but not as fun.   
In this presentation we'll cover regulatory standards, security basics and best practices, and the various encryption options available in SQL Server (Backups, TDE, Column, AlwaysEncrypted).  We'll also cover monitoring/logging, go over some new features, and some bonus material on dealing with audits.  
I look forward to seeing you there!

## Title: Understanding Parameter Sniffing
 
**Abstract**:
Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.

## Title: Basic Windowing Functions
 
**Abstract**:
Windowing functions are when you add a "window" to which rows a function will look at using the OVER clause. We'll start by learning how to add the OVER clause to the commonplace COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX aggregate functions, since the OVER clause is optional. From there, we'll learn some ranking functions, which do require the OVER clause. You'll see examples that use the ROW_NUMBER function to identify and delete duplicate rows. Finally, we'll close with the RANK and DENSE_RANK functions that help you report on the grouping of your data.

## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs
 
**Abstract**:
If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

I started as a night shift computer operator out of high school. I moved to applications development after graduation from SAC. After a few years with the State as an applications developer, the manager of Systems Programming decided it would be better to have me on the inside looking out rather than on the outside trying to get in. I spent the next 14 years as a mainframe system programmer for two state agencies. In 1996 I moved to Healthcare IT and have been that ever since. I’ve spent most of the past 14 years doing ETL, performance and HIPAA security. In these various jobs, I’ve used all manner of databases including InfoTec IMP, IBM VSAM and DB2, Interbase, Informix, Universe, Oracle 9i and SQL Server from 6.0 to 2008 R2.
