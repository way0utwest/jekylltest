## Title: The Power of Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
In this session you will see Microsoft's Power BI tools in action. We will show you the true meaning of the word "Power" in Power BI. You will witness world-shattering evolutionary changes in data access and modelling using the Power BI Desktop. Not only will we show you how to access data from internal and external sources, but you will also see how simple and straightforward it is to transform and shape data in a variety of sophisticated ways and blend more context and relevance into your data analysis projects. From world population statistics, economic and health trend indicators, public datasets and importing spreadsheets to analyzing the statistics of the MotoGP World Championship or your favorite movies. The world of data is changing rapidly, and many new rich data sources are being discovered constantly, attend this session to see how you can too can take advantage of this with Microsoft Power BI .

## Title: Beginners Guide to HA/DR, that can save your Bacon.
 
**Abstract**:
High Availability and Disaster Recovery have been an enterprise requirement since SQL Server was first released. In this full day session I will take you through current options to design and implement HA/DR solutions meeting the ever increasing demands of corporate environments.  The content will look at what is currently available to us to use in an On-premises, Cloud, or Hybrid environments, specifically outlining the exciting new features that make it compelling to migrate immediately to SQL Server 2016.
I will cover the following topics across 3 modules for the day:
•	Define and characterize HA/DR and the options provided by SQL Server
•	Design an appropriate HA/DR solution to meet requirements for either an On-premises, Cloud, or Hybrid environments

## Title: CortanaAnalytics : with RaspberryPI  WeatherSensor
 
**Abstract**:
Cortana Analytics delivers an end-to-end platform with an integrated and comprehensive set of tools and services to help users to build intelligent applications. This session will show how Cortana can be used for monitoring live data collected from devices like weather sensors  and how we can use Cortana intelligence suit to monitor the live data and apply some machine learning process on them. In this Demo I will show how to set up an IoT device like Raspberry PI, how to use different components of Cortana Intelligence suite  for transferring data (Azure service bus and azure stream analytics), storing data in a azure SQL database, getting insights from collected data using azure ML,  and finally showing the results through  automatically in Power BI.

## Title: Protecting your data from SQL Injection attacks
 
**Abstract**:
Kevin will be talking on the topic of SQL injection - something that all of us need to be aware of and protect against. 

And here is a blurb from:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A1-Injection

" The best way to find out if an application is vulnerable to injection is to verify that all use of interpreters clearly separates untrusted data from the command or query. For SQL calls, this means using bind variables in all prepared statements and stored procedures, and avoiding dynamic queries. 
Checking the code is a fast and accurate way to see if the application uses interpreters safely. Code analysis tools can help a security analyst find the use of interpreters and trace the data flow through the application. Penetration testers can validate these issues by crafting exploits that confirm the vulnerability."

Kevin will give us a demo that will show an injection attack in action and how to mitigate it.

## Title: DevOPs and the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
You may have heard the word "DevOps" and wondered whether it is just another buzzword and/or what it can do for you.
In this session I will demystify the concepts of DevOps and we will look at two aspects of DevOps - Continuous Integration  Continuous Delivery.

Continuous Integration is the practice in which software developers frequently integrate their work with that of other members of the development team.It also involves automating tests around the integrated work

​Continuous Delivery is the next step after Continuous Integration in the deployment pipeline and is the process of automating the deployment of software to  test, staging, and production environments.

Database migrations/changes are an area that may not be typically automated or utilise Continuous Delivery.

Through the use of a comprehensive live demo to a running production database the audience will learn the benefits and how to implement Continuous Delivery in their database systems deployment pipeline.

## Title: Schroedinger’s Backup – will your recovery work?
 
**Abstract**:
If you do not test your recovery plan you are unknowingly running a Schrödinger’s backup experiment, as your backup can be thought of as both being a good backup and being a bad backup. Until you attempt a restore the condition of any Backup is unknown.

While Schrödinger’s  cat was a thought experiment that may have injured an imaginary feline, a failure to be able to recover databases when required can prove  terminal to both careers   and Companies.

In this session Patrick will walk you through how to design,  create and test Recovery strategies. Using T-SQL and PowerShell you will leave with the tools necessary to avoid you own failed Schroedinger’s Backup experiment.

## Title: Cardinality Estimator: A Ride from SQL 7.0 to SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
Cardinality estimator, providing row estimates plays a pivotal role in obtaining efficient query plans. Cardinality estimator, which had remained unchanged since SQL 7.0, was revamped in SQL Server 2014 and was further changed in SQL Server 2016. Presentation will compare the differences between old cardinality estimator (CE 70), cardinality estimator 2014 (CE 120) and cardinality estimator 2016 (CE 130). The presentation will showcase several common real world scenarios which would directly benefit from the latest cardinality estimator. Presentation would take a deep dive ride covering the behind the scene tales detailing how the new cardinality estimator performs row estimates, resulting in accurate query plans. Presentation would also explain how regression testing can be performed using SQL Server 2016 Query Store and will highlight the scenarios where one needs to strike a balance between old and new cardinality estimators.

## Title: Power Query is more than just a desktop BI ETL tool
 
**Abstract**:
Power Query is a relatively new addition to Microsoft Excel that brings ETL to the self service BI user's desktop.  In this level 200 session I cover the basics of Power Query and how it can be used for desktop BI before quickly moving on to demonstrate how you can use Power Query for more advanced scenarios that you may not have thought of before, including:
	• Use Power Query as a data provider for traditional Excel Pivot Tables without using Power Pivot.
	• Building a Power Pivot calendar table from scratch using pure Power Query steps.
	• Add commentary to bank statements and make those comments "stick" using self-referencing tables.
	• Using Power Query as an auditing and exception management
        • Using Power Query as a pure ETL tool and exporting more than 1 m rows of transformed data to a file.
