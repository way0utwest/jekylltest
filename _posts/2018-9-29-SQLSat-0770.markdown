##Title: Build a White/Blacklist Bouncer. Who Gets into Your SQL Club?##
 
**Abstract**:
Are too many systems hitting your SQL Servers? Do you know who they all are? Are you under attack?
When it comes to this type of problem the consensus is to get with your network and domain admins to adequately configure access options. 
What happens when you can't wait or don't even have folks in that role to get the configuration right? 

A blacklist is a list of what cannot access something you are trying to protect. (Like the TSA no-fly list. If you are on the list, you are not getting anywhere fast.)

A whitelist is just the opposite. It is a list of what is permitted to access something. If whatever is attempting access is not on the list, it isn’t getting in.
In this session, we will go through the process to create and test your own SQL based whitelists and blacklists and also take a look at how whitelisting is being used in SQL 2017 to control what CLR objects can be trusted to run in your environment.

##Title: Data Profiling or Statistics 201##
 
**Abstract**:
Any new database design, normalization process or just simple research starts from data profiling. At first you determine number of rows in the data set. After that you run multiple similar queries against each column to determine Max and Min values, maximum length for text columns, number of nulls, distribution of data, and more.
When all these queries are already pre-set or dynamic or you are doing profiling via SQL Server Data Tools, it is not a problem on relatively small data set, but what if your table contains billions of records, and stretches for multiple gigabytes? All queries against that large data set will do a full table scan, which will produce very heavy I/O, and take forever.
In order to make the process faster, we will use a hidden gem of SQL Server:  Statistics. Only one table scan will be needed to generate them, and then we can use the science behind them to do research over our data.

##Title: SQL Server Transactional Replication: A Deeper Dive##
 
**Abstract**:
Transactional replication in SQL Server is not a new, shiny technology. In fact, a lot of people will tell you it's an old one full of nightmares. But don't be too quick to judge; replication still offers a lot of benefits, and  most of the problems you might encounter can be quickly diagnosed and fixed if you have a deeper understanding of replication internals.

In this session, we'll discuss the transactional replication model and what it offers. You'll see plenty of examples of how to monitor transactions as they get from your publishers to your subscribers. There will also be examples of how you can change the behavior of your transactions too, and what benefits (and potential pitfalls) these changes offer.

Finally, you'll see examples on how to configure transactional replication in high availability scenarios.

##Title: SQL Server and PowerShell: Let's Get Serious##
 
**Abstract**:
Whether you’ve dabbled in PowerShell or wondered what all the fuss is about, make no mistake: PowerShell isn’t going away. It is definitely something worth learning to make your life as a SQL Server professional easier, and allow you to advance in your career as a DBA.

In this session, you’ll see practical, real-world examples of how you can blend SQL Server and PowerShell together. You’ll also get a look at the SQL Server PowerShell provider and how you can incorporate it into your automation scripts.

Instead of focusing on syntax, the session will plunge straight into examples and highlight various snippets of code and how they work. You can expect to see code examples on how PowerShell can do anything from comparing tables across servers, automating and centralizing your backups, and even doing in-depth security audits.

##Title: Power BI Basics - On Coke##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session I will be demonstrating how easy Power BI lets you ingest almost anything; from simple files to complex multi-file scenarios. The Power BI Desktop application lets you solve 80% of the challenges you have with data via the GUI, and the other 20% we will deal with using the Advanced Editor. We will spend time in both accordingly.

In detail we will be looking at these topics:
	Straight up file (csv, xlsx)
	Scraping Web Page Data (html)
	Header/Footer issues
	Variable number of columns
	Multiple File Formats (think historical changes)
	Binding Multiple Imports into a single table
	Crude Error handling
	
Attending this session you'll learn the basics of Power BI Desktop, as well as some neat tricks to get through the more complex scenarios. 

Additionally I will demonstrate how to deploy your home grown model into Azure Analysis Services

##Title: Always Encrypted for Beginners##
 
**Abstract**:
One of the biggest challenges to successful implementation of data encryption has been the back and forth between the application and the database.  You have to overcome the obstacle of the application decrypting the data it needs.  Microsoft tried to simplify this process when it introduced Always Encrypted (AE) into SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database.  In this demo intense session, you will learn about what Always Encrypted is, how it works, and the implications for your environment. By the end you will know how to now easily encrypt columns of data and just as importantly how to unencrypt. You will also learn about the current limitations of the feature and what your options are to work around them.

##Title: Automate the Pain Away with Adaptive Query Processing and Automatic Tuning##
 
**Abstract**:
The way you tune your SQL Server workloads are changing.  In the past, you would rely on dynamic management views, execution plan cache, and server-side traces or extend events.  In SQL Server 2012 we were introduced to Columnstore indexes; In SQL 2014 the cardinality estimator got a huge overhaul. With SQL Server 2016 we were given query store to allow us to get more insight into our performance pains and execution plan changes. SQL Server 2017 gave us Automatic Tuning and Adaptive Query Processing to help automate performance improvements. In this session, we will harness the ways you improve performance into the new so you can automate the pain away and spend more time identifying and tuning pain points that cannot be automated.

You've heard of indexes, and maybe you've even tried creating them.  However, they don't always seem to improve the performance of your queries. How are you supposed to know what columns to include? Should you just build an index for every column in your table? (hint: probably not)

In this session you will learn the basics of how to create performance improving indexes. We'll discuss how to identify when a performance problem is due to a missing or poorly defined index, the different types of indexes available in SQL Server, and how to know when to use each type (as well as what columns to include!).

##Title: SQL Server Databaseology: A Deep Dive Into Database Internals##
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever taken apart a toaster or an alarm clock just to see how it worked? Ever wondered how that database actually functions at the record level, behind the scenes? SQL Server Databaseology is the study of SQL Server databases and their structures down to the very core of the records themselves. In this session, we will explore some of the deep inner workings of a SQL Server database at the record and page level.  You will walk away with a better understanding of how SQL Server stores data and that knowledge will allow you to build better, faster databases.

##Title: “Black Arts” Index Maintenance #2: Better Methods that Can Actually Prevent Fragmentation for Weeks.##
 
**Abstract**:
Most people don’t know it but the current “Best Practice” Methods are actually the leading cause of perpetual logical and physical fragmentation, costly and continuous “Bad” page splits, comparatively insane amounts of log file generation and, in an interesting “Catch 22”, the whole reason for why we have to do so much index maintenance.

This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this second of two back-to-back sessions, we’ll learn of several incredibly easy modifications to your Index Maintenance routines to actually prevent fragmentation for weeks rather than perpetuating it,  virtually eliminate “Bad” page splits, reduce wasted memory, make your log file and log file backups a whole lot more happy, and increase the overall performance of even perfect code.

We’ll also learn that no simple method is a panacea, what to do about the horror of "expAnsive" updates, and how to make even GUID-keyed indexes work well.

##Title: 5 Minute No Sweat SQL Security Audits##
 
**Abstract**:
Security audits such as PCI, STIG, or HIPAA, are important and can be complicated. Depending on the requirements it may take considerable time to gather the information you will need.
In this session, you will get scripts that I use for compliance audits that help to collect the information required for many different audits quickly. Even when you have multiple SQL Servers, you can quickly and easily identify where to focus your efforts to ensure you pass security audits. Through demonstration and discussion of what and why certain items get reviewed you will leave with a better understanding of how to be compliant within you SQL Server environment.

##Title: Working Smarter by Using Window Functions##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you ever find yourself needing to rank the results of your queries? Maybe you need to calculate averages for specific groups within your data, or maybe you would like to include lag values in your output. These needs and many others can often be satisfied using window functions, a set of functions that can perform multi-row calculations while maintaining all of the original rows of your output.
In this session, you will learn how to use window functions in your queries. You'll also see some typical window function use cases and you'll get to look at some common mistakes people make with window functions so you can avoid them yourself. If you can write a query that uses a simple join, then these functions may be the next tool to add to your repertoire.

##Title: “Black Arts” Index Maintenance #1: How the “Best Practice” Methods are Silently Killing Performance##
 
**Abstract**:
Most people don’t know it but the current “Best Practice” Methods are actually the leading cause of perpetual logical and physical fragmentation, costly and continuous “Bad” page splits, comparatively insane amounts of log file generation and, in an interesting “Catch 22”, the whole reason for why we have to do so much index maintenance.

This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this first of two back-to-back sessions on the subject, we’ll explore what happens to an index in the first year of its life for four different common Fill Factors along with how “Best Practice” methods executed once per week and once per day have their way with you, your indexes, your log files, wasted memory, and the performance of your code even if it’s perfect code.

**Abstract**:
A childhood dream to travel around the world fueled by reading Gulliver's Travels stories and Robinson Crusoe attempts to survive on a deserted island.

There is something that could captivate your mind and propel your imagination for traveling when you immerse yourself in maps.

Power BI itself a great tool that could feed your appetite for an adventure using built-in and custom map visualizations. Let's explore them!

##Title: Mom Rules for Managing Enterprise Database Environments##
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever looked at an environment and wondered how the heck they ever got anything done because it is so disorganized? The first thing I do for newly inherited environments is implement some organization and do some database clean up.  Not only does organization make the environment easier to maintain, it can help speed up trouble shooting.  Good organization can even help with some performance issues.

##Title: Take the changes under control##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server does not support source safe control as the .NET application does. However, utilizing DDL trigger events makes it possible to capture when database users, ether one DBA or Developer, create, alter and drop the SQL Server objects. This session demonstrates the complete solution on how to set up SQL Server source safe control, log any changes and roll back to any historical point of changes.

##Title: Cleaning Is Half The Battle: Launching A Data Science Project##
 
**Abstract**:
There's an old adage in software development: Garbage In, Garbage Out. This adage certainly applies to data science projects: if you simply throw raw data at models, you will end up with garbage results. In this session, we will build an understanding of just what it takes to implement a data science project whose results are not garbage. We will the Microsoft Team Data Science Process as our model for project implementation, learning what each step of the process entails. To motivate this walkthrough, we will see what we can learn from a survey of data professionals' salaries.

##Title: Cloudy with a Chance of Data##
 
**Abstract**:
The 'Cloud" is here.  With it, there are many options for storing and processing data.  What does it mean?  Why should you be interested in this conversation?  How can a cloud solution compare to an "on-prem" solution?  We will discuss these questions and more. The focus of this session will be on the options available in Azure from Azure SQL DB to Azure SQL Data Lake, but we will also touch on AWS and Google Cloud options to put the options in context.

##Title: Troubleshooting and Tuning Query Performance##
 
**Abstract**:
Troubleshooting query performance in SQL Server is often viewed as a black art. Every expert has their own set of tools they use to find and fix the problem areas of queries. SQL Server tools provide the necessary information to both diagnose and troubleshoot where those problems actually are, and help you fix those issues. In this session we will use a variety of tools to analyze and solve query performance problems.

##Title: I have to support what!?  SQL, Oracle, and Mongo -  A side by side “how to”##
 
**Abstract**:
More and more companies are starting to invest in multiple database platforms and DBAs are needing to develop a skillset to support a mixed-database environment.  Database concepts are often the same between platforms, however, the “how” can be very different (and sometimes not different at all!).  Starting with the basics and gradually moving into the more advanced; this session will show you how to perform the same task in SQL Server, Oracle, and Mongo.  Take a leap and start your journey in to the multi-platform world!

##Title: Tips on Managing Lots of SQL Servers##
 
**Abstract**:
When managing a single server it is easy to keep track of the configuration of that server, but what about when you have more than ten servers to manage or a hundred? How do you know they are setup correctly?  How do you maintain the databases on each server? How do you take care of patching? How do you know when your server is on fire? 

In this talk we will answer these questions and more as we discuss technologies and approaches you can use to make sure your environment is configured and performing at its best.

##Title: Intro to Query Store##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, we will look at the new Query Store feature in SQL Server 2016 and 2017.  Query Store tracks changes in execution plans, allowing you to easily view performance differences and revert to older plans with a few clicks of the mouse in 2016.

Then in 2017, Microsoft added wait stats per query plan and Automatic Tuning capabilities.  Allowing DBAs more tools to troubleshoot fires with and a way to automatically resolve issues.

In this session, we will walk through the features of Query Store, so you can understand how to use them in SQL Server 2016 and 2017.

##Title: Power BI Internals: a Deep Dive##
 
**Abstract**:
When people talk about Power BI, it can be all sizzle and no steak. Instead, we are going to take a slightly deeper dive into the inner workings of PowerBI. We will cover the different components of the Power BI ecosystem: PowerQuery, DAX, Power BI visuals, Data gateways, and the Power BI service. Instead of just showing off pretty graphs, we will focus on a more fundamental understanding of these tools.

##Title: Relationship Goals:  The SQL Server Graph Database##
 
**Abstract**:
Relational databases have their strengths.  Ironically data relationships are not one of them.  Graph databases excel in this department using nodes and edges.  They are optimized to find and view relationships using graph theory.

##Title: Adopting A DevOps Process for Your Database##
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps is changing today's software development world by helping us build better software, faster. However most of the knowledge and experience with DevOps is based around application software and ignores the database. We will examine how the concepts and principles of DevOps can be applied to database development by looking at both automated comparison analysis as well as migration script management. Automated building, testing, and deployment of database changes will be shown.

##Title: Temporal Tables – The New Hotness in Data Auditing##
 
**Abstract**:
A common issue database administrators face is data auditing.  Many use triggers, CDC, third-party tools, or roll their own type of auditing tool.  In SQL Server 2016, a new feature called Temporal Tables was introduced and helps to simplify this common need.  In this session, we will take a look at what temporal tables are, how they work and how you can implement them into your environment.
