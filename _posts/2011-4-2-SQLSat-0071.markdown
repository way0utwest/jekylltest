##Title: SQL Query Optimization - It's Not Rocket Science!##
 
**Abstract**:
Writing a query optimizer that produces a great execution plan for every SQL query, on every database, with every hardware configuration, is a hard problem. A really hard problem. Luckily, few of us will be called upon to write an optimizer. On the other hand, most of us have to make use of the SQL Server query optimizer in our everyday work. To write queries that will optimize well, it helps to have a good understanding of how the optimizer translates T-SQL code into an executable plan and how to read those plans. Come to this session and learn how to take full advantage of the optimizer's powerful features, how to avoid some of its limitations, and how to leverage the wealth of information contained in SQL Server's execution plans.

##Title: Creating a Metadata Mart wi/SSIS - Data Governance##
 
**Abstract**:
Recently I have had a client that required migrating and re hosting a data warehouse from the Oracle environment to the Netezza Appliance. The application had hundreds of tables and almost 2900 Source to Target Mappings. This would have taken 1000's of hours of manual coding. For this client we implemented a reusable data driven architecture, via SSIS, that rely on a metadata mart. The end result a greatly reduced TCO(development effort) for generating the code required vs manual coding. In addition the process leaves behind a metadata mart to report on for auditing and other Data Governance efforts. We generated over 100,000 lines of code and over 3000 load scripts.

##Title: SQL Server 2008 Auditing##
 
**Abstract**:
You may ask yourself, “Who did drop my table? Who altered this Stored Procedure? When did this SQL login grant access to a database? Who inserted, updated or deleted records in a table? Do you need to meet regulatory compliance needs?”
If you’d like to know the answers, this session is for you, I will cover the technical details of the new Auditing feature in SQL Server 2008 with lots of demos and how you can leverage it in your SQL server environment. I will show you how to build a Centralized Auditing Solution where you can view all audit events in your environment centrally with rich dashboards and reports to track and view all audit actions by server, database, object and users across all SQL servers.

**Abstract**:
The Dynamic Management Objects--a set of views and functions that first shipped with SQL Server 2005--are a window into the inner workings of your SQL Server instance. Locked within is the data you need to help solve virtually any performance problem, quickly debug issues, and gain insight into what's actually happening on your server, right now. This session is a fast-paced tour of the ins, outs, whys, hows, and even pitfalls of 15 of the most important views and functions--information gleaned from heavy use of the objects in a number of environments. You will learn how to understand transaction behavior, locking, wait statistics, sessions, requests, and much more. Attend this session and you will be the master of your SQL Server instance.

##Title: As A DBA, Where Do I Start?!##
 
**Abstract**:
You've always wanted to get promoted into the DBA position. The good news is you got it - the bad news is you have no idea what to do first. What's important, what's not a big deal, and what can get you fired if you're not careful? If your answer wasn’t, “update my resume”, then this session is a good start. We’ll chat about a natural priority for the overwhelming flood waiting in our offices. By focusing on a few words ending in “ity” we’ll realize what is most important. Through the interaction, stories and examples you’ll leave feeling ready to attack your environment. Be warned – along the way to knowing where to start, you may get that feeling in your stomach that makes you log on to the VPN to check a few things out.

##Title: Database Design for mere developers##
 
**Abstract**:
Efficient and effective database design is so important that  leaving it solely to the DBAs is simply not a solution. We as developers will more than likely have to create applications to access the data stores and as such must ensure that all application related considerations are taken into account within the database design.
In this session, (aimed at software developers) we shall be touching upon several concepts of special importance to the developer. These include database development "patterns and anti-patterns",  final proofing of design and creating versatile deployment scripts that can and will be utilized in future endeavors.

##Title: Understanding Indexes in SQL Server 2008##
 
**Abstract**:
Understanding the fundamentals of how indexes work and how they are best utilized is an essential part of any DBA or SQL developer’s repertoire.  Many people assume if you create an index on a column or columns of a table that it will automatically be used when you reference that column. While that may be true under some conditions the actual usage depends on several key factors and they may surprise you. We will cover the fundamentals of how the indexes work under the covers and why you need to know this in order to ensure your indexes are actually helping and not hurting your performance.

##Title: Encryption in SQL 2008 R2 - Column and TDE##
 
**Abstract**:
We will discuss the “how to’s” of column encryption from the perspective of the DBA, Performance Analyst, Application Architect, and Programmer. We will actually encrypt the “NationalIDNumber” column of the Personel.Employee table in AdventureWorks – and subsequently the entire AdventureWorks database.   I will contrast column encryption with Transparent Data Encryption (TDE).  We will also briefly discuss business role changes necessary to support encryption and subsequently DR.

##Title: Storing Data in the Cloud: Beyond SQL Azure##
 
**Abstract**:
We live in world where the management of structured data is dominated by relational databases. What happens when we get to the cloud? You may have heard about SQL Azure, Microsoft's take on SQL Server for the cloud. Won't everything be just like the old days? Not so fast... In this talk we will review some of the key differences between SQL Server and SQL Azure, then consider some of the other data storage options offered by Windows Azure. After this talk you will understand the broader picture of storage in Windows Azure and have a basic understanding of how to employ these complementary data storage solutions -- along-side some of the old-school approaches you currently know and love.

##Title: Introduction to Developing with SQL Azure ##
 
**Abstract**:
The Cloud is fast becoming the latest hot topic in the technology arena. We need to understand how we as SQL Developers and Administrators can utilize SQL Azure, Microsoft’s platform for relational data storage in the Cloud, to meet our needs. This talk will be a step-by-step demo of how to obtain an Azure subscription, create and administer a SQL Azure database, and work with it from your own SQL Server Management Studio AddIn. You’ll find that Azure is so easy to work with, you’ll get two for the price of one in this talk: you’ll learn Azure and learn how to create a Management Studio AddIn!

##Title: SSIS Performance Design Patterns##
 
**Abstract**:
Need a fast data integration solution, but don't have the time or budget for heavy performance tuning? Come learn how to maximize your ROI by applying trusted design patterns to your Integration Services packages. We’ll start off by looking at how to set performance expectations, and see how you can easily put together a simple framework to record benchmarks for your ETL process. We’ll then dive into a number of common design patterns, such as surrogate key generation, advanced Lookup patterns, parallel processing, change data capture, and different ways of handling slowly changing dimensions .

##Title: Consolidation and Virtualization: A Success Story##
 
**Abstract**:
Consolidating SQL Server Instances can be daunting. Virtualizing SQL Server instances can be intimidating. Doing both at the same time can be absolutely frightening. 

When Mike Hillwig inherited his SQL environment, he had 14 SQL Server instances, running five different versions of SQL, all using local disk. In one project, his team consolidated this down to four servers. And the entire environment is virtual. In this session, MIke will share what they did, how they did it, what worked, and what didn't work so well.

##Title: Self Service BI on a Budget##
 
**Abstract**:
Wow BI on a budget...or how a DBA can roll out some of Microsoft's vision of Self Service BI using just SQL EXPRESS. In this session we go from a payroll feed in csv to a SQL 2008 Reporting Services Management Report. This report is utilizing windows login as hidden row level secuity. Finance retains control of access to the payroll information. All this can be set up on SBS 2011

##Title: Gather SQL Server Performance Data with PowerShell##
 
**Abstract**:
We all know how important it is to keep a baseline of performance metrics that allow us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  We don't always know how to do this easily and consistently.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.

##Title: Maximizing Plan Re-use in SQL 2008##
 
**Abstract**:
Lack of plan reuse is one of the biggest performance killers in SQL Server and almost everyone has experienced problems in this area before. We will explore exactly how to determine if this is an issue for you and more importantly, how to address it. See what factors determine if a plan gets reused or not and why. We will cover how to issue calls to the database that guarantee reuse and peak performance.  Understanding this aspect of SQL Server is something every good DBA should be fully aware of and attending this session will get you the insight to get started immediately.

##Title: Let Service Broker Help You Scale Your Application##
 
**Abstract**:
Service Broker was introduced in SQL Server 2005 to provide asyncronous messaging in your database applications, but it's seldom used because it isn't well understood.  In this session we'll walk you through the basics of Service Broker and show how you can use it to build highly scalable applications.
