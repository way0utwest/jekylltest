## Title: Power BI Datasets: Where Should My Data Live?
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI provides many options for acquiring and creating datasets. Do you know the difference between an Imported Model, a Live Connection, and DirectQuery? Have you tried Composite Models? Are you aware of the newest features related to Power BI Dataflows and XMLA endpoints? This session will review your options for where to store data and explain the factors that should be used in determining what option is right for you. Obvious requirements such as data size, license costs and management, and desired data latency will be discussed. We'll also talk about other factors such as the desire for self-service BI and avoiding data model sprawl. Join us for this webcast to learn how to determine the most appropriate type of Power BI dataset for your use case.

## Title: Using Extended Events for Wait Stats Analysis
 
**Abstract**:
When troubleshooting overall server performance, wait statistics are a great place to start. But when your SQL Server hosts a complex set of workloads, it can be difficult to narrow down which queries are causing the most wait, and what types of wait they are causing. Fortunately, SQL Server provides easy ways for targeting which queries are causing you the most wait time. In this session, we’ll learn how to use both Extended Events, and Dynamic Management Views for examining wait statistics from the instance level to the database level, all the way down to the individual query level. We’ll analyze poorly performing queries using a combination of methods and show how to quickly narrow down what SQL Server is waiting for, and why.

## Title: Lessons Learned from a Successful Enterprise Power BI Deployment
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI is an amazing tool for end-user analytics and reporting, but if you don't architect for it correctly it may not work right as an enterprise reporting solution. Come to this session to get actual implementation details from a real deployment that was completed for a mid-sized company (1,500+ employees) and is being used daily by more than half of the employees after only a few months of being live in production. Using demos and actual documentation you will see what you need to think of for a project like this. We will be covering architecture, implementation, governance, change control, and support to get a Power BI enterprise deployment working successfully from someone that has done it! Azure Analysis Services, Power BI Pro, and Power BI Premium will be discussed and how each is being used in this solution as well.

## Title: Encrypting Data within SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Data breaches abound! Do you want to keep your company out of the headlines? What are some of the data privacy laws affecting you? How will encrypting data affect your database performance? What data fields should you encrypt?  What else can you do to protect your sensitive data?
 
In this session, we will review each option to encrypt data within SQL Server, Transparent Data Encryption, Cell Level Encryption and Always Encrypted. While we look at the encryption options, we will review both on-premise and cloud offerings.  This session will deep dive into setting up Always Encrypted encryption and share experiences implementing the encryption.  Also, let’s learn how to classify data which should be protected and how to audit sensitive data usage. 
 
You will leave this session with a deeper understanding about SQL Server encryption options and how encryption can affect your performance.  Also, you will gather information on how to fully protect and review your sensitive data usage.

## Title: Managing ETL Change Using BIMLScript
 
**Abstract**:
Change is constant, especially with source files. Health care claims data files change at least yearly. You develop an SSIS package to load the source file. You meticulously identify each of the columns and map them to the targets. Your package runs fine for months. Then the file format changes. Again, you tediously select each column, etc. Wouldn't it be nice to simply document the structure of the file, the file's metadata, and generate the SSIS from that metadata? Your users demand the documentation anyway. If the file changes, you simply change the metadata. 

To demonstrate such an approach, I import some US census data. I create the SSIS package using BIMLScript and metadata. When the format changes, I change the metadata and generate a whole new package. And if your whole ETL approach changes to say Azure Data Factory? I will demonstrate how to generate an Azure Data Factory pipeline from the same metadata.

## Title: Real-World PowerShell for SQL Administration
 
**Abstract**:
If you're like me, you've attended PowerShell sessions before. However, much of the *practical* usage of PS comes with rolling back your sleeves and digging into the nuances of syntax and how to get things done. We are going to focus specifically on using PowerShell within the SQL Server Agent to build out everyday jobs.

In this session, I'm assuming that you know the basics of PowerShell. What we're going to cover are some of the "gotchas" and nuances that I've run into when I've been working with the language, and particularly with the SQL Agent's flavor of PowerShell.

And then we'll spend the balance of our time looking at real-world, practical scripts that I use pretty much every day. PowerShell is an awesome way to automate so many processes and relieve some of the everyday monotony of SQL administration.

## Title: Zen and the Art of Baselines
 
**Abstract**:
If your boss asked you for the list of the five most CPU-hungry databases in your environment six months from now for an upcoming licensing review, do you have an answer? Performance data can be overwhelming, but this session can help you make sense of the mess. Twisting your brain and looking at the data in different ways can help you identify resource bottlenecks that are limiting your SQL Server performance today. Trending this data over time will help you project how much resource consumption you will have months away. Come learn how to extract meaning from your performance trends and how to use it to proactively manage the resource consumption from your SQL Servers.

## Title: Graph Databases–How and Why
 
**Abstract**:
We, as data professionals, are dealing with increasingly larger amounts of data. And, increasingly, we're asked to generate insights from this data. For that, the relationships between data points matter more than simple aggregations of individual data points. In our interconnected world, interconnected businesses, interconnected applications, graph databases lend themselves to answering relationship questions far more easily than...relational databases.

In this session we'll look at graph databases for
	how to model graph databases
	how to easily express relationships between interconnected data
	how to efficiently retrieve interrelated data 

We'll look at the MATCH predicate in T-SQL and the MATCH statement in Cypher, the query language for Neo4j.

## Title: HA/DR Solutions Using Distributed Availability Groups (Read-Scalable AGs too!)
 
**Abstract**:
When designing your HA/DR solution, you need to consider all the possible options SQL Server has to offer to implement what is right for you.  You will see how to use Failover Cluster Instances, Standalone Instances, Clusters, Availability Groups and Distributed Availability Groups.

We will walk through how to set up and configure an HA/DR solution from beginning to end, review possible alerts, and how to monitor.  We will take a look at the new SQL2017 Read-scale Availability Groups and why to use them.  We will architect one of many possible VM solutions to host your HA/DR implementation.

Finally, we will see Automatic Failover and see how to perform a Manual Failover.

## Title: How to do a Complete SQL Server Assessment
 
**Abstract**:
Completing a full assessment on a SQL Server is essential to learning about not only the current state of the server, but also any area that may be impacting performance or security.  If you have more than one DBA, it is also important to have all the DBA team members review the same areas when completing an assessment.  During this session we will discuss when assessments are useful, what should be included in the assessment as well as how to interpret the results.  We will use a SQL script that will capture all the data needed.  This script will more than 88 data points, including fragmentation of indexes, performance counter values, server and database security information, queries that consume the most CPU time including execution plans as well as many other data points. This session will also cover how to document your findings and recommendations.

## Title: Principle of Least Privilege: The Key to Strong Security
 
**Abstract**:
A truly strong security model starts with no permissions and adds what is necessary to allow the user or application to do their assigned task - no more, no less. This is called the Principle of Least Privilege. It's a simple concept, but it can be quite difficult to implement in practice, especially if the prevailing practice has been much more permissive.

In this session, we'll talk about the Principle of Least Privilege in more detail, and we'll discuss ways to implement it for the three primary classes of users - general users, applications, and administrators. Each has their own set of needs that requires a separate approach to allowing the security to meet those needs. You'll leave with actionable ideas on ways that you can improve your company's security while minimizing the impact of the changes.

## Title: Always Encrypted - Now with Enclaves!
 
**Abstract**:
If you took a look at Always Encrypted in SQL Server 2016, you may have had some reservations about it. It was a great concept, but because the database engine could no longer access the data, a lot more of the data processing was pushed to the clients. For many companies, that was far from ideal.

Enter SQL Server 2019. With Always Encrypted with Secure Enclaves, the benefits of Always Encrypted are retained, but the SQL Server engine gains the ability to carry out operations on the data - without the data ever leaving the server, and without decryption. How is this possible? Does it live up to its promises? Come to this session to find out and to see how to use it in your applications.

## Title: SQL Server 2019 - New Features and Enhancements
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2019 is in Public preview for almost 1 year. Microsoft promises that it is going to be released for consumption this year. Like previous versions, SQL Server 2019 comes with a plethora of new features as well as with enhancements to the existing features. In this session, I will discuss new features such as Accelerated Database Recovery, PMEM (persistent memory device), Hybrid Buffer pool, In-memory Optimized Tempdb, etc. 
This is an introductory session to introduce you to these new features. There will not be enough time to do any meaningful demo but there will be plenty of time to ask questions. You will leave this session with a solid understanding of some of the best new features of SQL Server 2019 which will help you and your company make decisions such as when and why to upgrade your database platform.

## Title: What is DevOps and Why Should DBAs Care?
 
**Abstract**:
You may have heard the term “DevOps” a lot lately, but is this just one of those buzzwords that gets thrown around and means something different depending on who’s talking? While traditional software methodologies pit developers and operations folks like DBAs against each other, DevOps requires that they work together for a common goal. And, ultimately, shouldn’t the software project’s success be everyone’s goal? 
Attend this session to learn how DevOps is changing the DBAs world for the better.

## Title: Ethics, Morals, and Laws for the DBA 101
 
**Abstract**:
Ethics, Morals, and Laws each govern one aspect of our behavior as people and DBAs. They govern which actions we take and which actions we avoid.

Understanding the basics of these guides and how they coordinate (and sometimes conflict) with each other helps you to make choices you can live with from both a personal and professional perspective.

This session presents basic definitions, ideas, and discussion points. It is intended to be an interactive presentation where the audience contributes to the discussion, so no two presentations are exactly the same!
