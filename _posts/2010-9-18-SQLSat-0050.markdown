## Title: Take the Awesomeness Home: the Data Collector
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Saturday provides insight into how to query your SQL Servers' performance, configuration, and needs. But there is a problem for the DBA: how do we quickly apply our new knowledge and scripts to multiple production servers? How do we collect the data we need regularly and query which instances need the most attention? How can we easily create reports proving ROI? In this session, attendees will learn to set up performance data collection with the SQL 2008 Management Data Warehouse (MDW). We will demonstrate how fast it is to create and configure custom data collections, giving examples from simple to complex scripts. This is the tool you need to automate collection for the awesome insights you've learned at SQL Saturday!

## Title: Query hints: The Jekyll and Hyde of T-SQL Coding
 
**Abstract**:
Dealing with the SQL Server optimizer can be maddening at times. One moment it will take a seemingly impossible query and make it run in no time flat. At other times, the optimizer will insist on a poor plan even though a much better alternative is available. What should you do when the optimizer won't behave? One option we have available is the use of query hints. While almost everyone agrees that query hints should be avoided whenever possible, there are some situations that make this difficult to achieve. Sometimes the judicious use of a query hint can save the day, but since hints are a taboo subject, we do not discuss them as much as we should. Come to this session and let's see if we can find a practical approach to hints!

## Title: Stay Agile, Stay Sane
 
**Abstract**:
Agile software development emphasizes continuous deployment and its methods do not directly include long term planning. DBAs must ensure data integrity and have a long term view for application scale, so Agile methods present challenges. Come learn about successful real-world practices iteratively developed in a high transaction internet service environment over the last five years. We have created a flourishing Agile shop while meeting high requirements for uptime, customer response, and data consistency. In this session we’ll cover key habits for success, practices to avoid, how and when to get started, and why Agile development can be a great thing for DBAs. Topics will also include how “Testing in Production” can be a huge benefit.

## Title: Using XML to Query Execution Plans 
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server stores its execution plans as XML in dynamic management views. The execution plans are a gold mine of information. From the whether or not the execution plan will rely on parallelism to what columns are requiring a key lookup after a non-clustered index seek. Through a the use of XML this information can be available at your fingertips to help determine the value and impact of an index and guide you in improving the performance of your SQL Server databases. In this session we’ll look at how you can begin to understand and query the structure of the execution plans in the procedure cache. Also, we’ll review how to uncover some potential performance issues that may be lurking in your SQL Server.

## Title: Women in Technology Lunch Panel
 
**Abstract**:
Encouraging the Next Generation  Everyone has heard that the number of women in technology is declining. How can all of us, women and men, encourage more young women to consider a career in technology? Join three dynamic Women in Technology – Kathi Kellenberger, Wendy Pastrick, and Jes Borland – to discuss this important and hot topic over lunch. Attendees are encouraged to ask questions, make suggestions, and share their experiences as well.

## Title: Applying Database Design
 
**Abstract**:
Beyond database design fundamentals (for example, Normalization) lies the area where you have to create "real" solutions. In this session, I will cover a good number of patterns that we commonly find useful to try to apply to the problem of building (and interpreting) a database solution. Ideas like generalization, subclassing, single table domain tables, optional data, and more will be discussed, some of them good, some not so good (don't assume which will be which), but all that are common and/or useful for your database implementations.

## Title: Take Control with Resource Governor and PBM
 
**Abstract**:
A large majority of a modern DBA's workload consists of managing their policies and resources on their system in order to ensure that they are being followed and resources are accessible when needed. SQL Server 2008 provides both Policy Based Management(PBM) and Resource Governor, which allows the DBA to discretely manage system policies and resources in a very structured way. In this session, we will show you how to configure, monitor, and administer these features to help lower your anxiety levels while increasing your system’s availability.

## Title: Monitoring Data Changes the Microsoft Way with CDC
 
**Abstract**:
Most modern enterprise database environments require some measure of auditing their data. Previously, the DBA would need to put together a complicated web of triggers and history tables in order to properly track data changes. Now in SQL Server 2008, Change Data Capture allows the DBA to readily enact a very straight-forward method for tracking the changes and understanding easily how they took place. In this session, we will examine how to set-up, configure, use, and administer the Change Data Capture process in your environment.

## Title: Getting To Know Your Indexes
 
**Abstract**:
Without proper indexing SQL Server can be hard pressed to create efficient and performant execution plans.  Dynamic Management Views (DMV) and system views provide a slew of information about indexes that can be used to analyze indexes within SQL Server.  In this session we’ll go under the hood of SQL Server to look at DMVs and system views to know what indexes you have, should have, and how they feel about the way applications are treating them.

## Title: If You Build It, They Will Try to Break It
 
**Abstract**:
It’s fun to build it, but sometimes it can be even more fun to try and break it.  SQL injection is one of the more common web vulnerabilities, and although many of us may be familiar with code injection, there are many new tools that help automate the attacker’s job.  As developers, it is good to know what the bad guys are using and how these tools work.  This talk will take us from the basics of SQL injection to remote code execution.  We will then look at some of the ways SQL injection attacks are being automated (with tools such as sqlmap, sqlninja, and other fuzzing applications).

## Title: SQL Performance Planning Tips for Developers
 
**Abstract**:
As developers, we get blamed when things run slow, very often from both the users and DBAs. In this session we will go through some tips that you may start to use in your project the next day, without going into too much details of database engine.

## Title: Developer AMA (Ask Me Anything)
 
**Abstract**:
An "Open Space" discussion facilitated by at least one developer, guided by these principles: whoever comes is the right people; whatever happens is the only thing that could have; and when it's over, it's over. Before it's over, discussion will likely range from "What's wrong with developers?" to "What's wrong with DBAs?" and various more productive topics in between.

## Title: Application Coding Sins
 
**Abstract**:
As DBAs, some of us might spend time writing actual application code, while others may spend time chewing out developers for writing poor code which negatively affects database performance.  This session will cover some common sins of application coding and best practices you can recommend to developers.

## Title: Develop T-SQL code Defensively
 
**Abstract**:
The goal of defensive database programming is to produce robust database code. You will learn how to program defensively by reviewing real life examples. Also you will learn some of the most common scenarios when T-SQL code breaks because of changes in environment settings and concurrency, and how to develop T-SQL that does not break in such situations.

## Title: Designing a Data Mart 101
 
**Abstract**:
Business Intelligence is becoming more important as competition becomes more fierce and global. If you are a traditional DBA supporting OLTP databases, how can you begin to understand the dimensional model? This session will take you step-by-step through designing a data mart, the first stop on your journey in this exciting and growing field.

## Title: What's New with Reporting Services
 
**Abstract**:
With the launch of SQL Server 2008 two years ago and R2 this year, Reporting Services (SSRS) has changed quite a bit. Find out why you should take the plunge and upgrade your SSRS implementation. Learn about enhancements in performance, reusability, and cool new features so you can take your reports to the next level.

## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
 
**Abstract**:
In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).

## Title: Are You Following Your Own Best Practices?
 
**Abstract**:
Everyone has their own best practices that they try to follow.  But often times we aren’t sure how well we are following our own or industry best practices.  In this session we’ll go into monitoring and managing best practices throughout your environment.  The session will look at how to create a solution using policy based management and other tools to report on your compliance to best practices.

## Title: Developing T-SQL that survives concurrency
 
**Abstract**:
Many T-SQL modules run correctly without concurrency, but they intermittently break when they are exposed to real life concurrency in OLTP systems. You will learn common real life scenarios when concurrency breaks T-SQL code. In addition, you will learn how to develop robust T-SQL which works correctly under concurrency.
