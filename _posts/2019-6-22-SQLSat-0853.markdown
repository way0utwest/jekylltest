##Title: Custom maps in Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
Let’s go beyond the standard visuals available in Power BI for making maps. In this session we won’t talk about Bing or ArcGIS services. We want to explore all the available features for creating custom maps without having to rely on existing ones. 
Do you know what is a shapefile? Do you know how to create your own choropleth and import it into Power BI? 
What else? R support into Power BI opened the doors to the huge number of packages for spatial data analysis and statistical calculations included in the environment. 
Do you want to draw multi-layered interactive maps, or perform spatial analytics?  With R in Power BI, now you can. 
Discover some custom visuals to overcome simple cartography: MapBox, IconMap, FlowMap. 
Last but not least, learn how to use Synoptic Panel, an awesome component that connects areas in a custom image with attributes in the data model and draws the data on a map. There are endless possibilities; the only limit is your imagination!

##Title: T-SQL advanced: Grouping and Windowing##
 
**Abstract**:
This session aims to explore all the features offered by the language T-SQL for aggregating and calculating data. There's much more of the clause GROUP BY.
With grouping and ranking functions you can calculate in your query grandtotal, running totals, find islands in intervals, select the last-not-null value, etc.
Windows functions apply directly on a set of rows defined by the OVER clause ("a window"). Windows function do not perform aggregation on group level and do not hide row details.
So they allow mixing detail and total elements in the same query.
The session is mainly based on a copious array of demos, to make explicit every concept introduced taking into account the impact on performances for every solution.

##Title: Making sense of Storage modes and Connection types in PowerBI##
 
**Abstract**:
If you've been around PowerBI you should already know what Import, Direct Query and Live Query are. Probably you've looked for the differences, you've read for something called Query Folding and if you've been following the news - you should have heard about composite models and the Dual storage mode and its partner in crime - the Aggregation table. But how to make sense of all of those? How to choose between them? When one is better than the other? Well, I am trying to find that out myself, and I have some facts to share with you. In the session we will compare Import with DQ and LQ, I'll show you the usage of Aggregations, we will talk about Dual mode and most importantly, I will share some real-life scenarios to wrap things up.

##Title: T-SQL Performance Guidelines for the optimal DB stress powers##
 
**Abstract**:
To reach your desired business functionalities, it can be easy using some common T-SQL practices like MTVF , scalar functions , Temp tables, Union…etc and they might perform pretty well on development server coz neither adequate stress of users nor adequate volume of data exist there but actually they seem totally strange once going to live where they become performing badly ending up eventually with and sharp skew of performance and standstill cases sometimes , this is due to the lack of stress powers of T-SQL codes which should be considered largely for critical mission DBs in particular more therefore I am going to talk to you about How to capture expensive queries using different techniques ..?and How to optimize them in the shortest time using scientific ways ..? (10 different T-SQL Practices will be explained within this session)

##Title: The Maths Behind Machine Learning##
 
**Abstract**:
The new world of Machine Learning can sound quite overwhelming! Do I need a PhD in Machine Learning to get involved? The answer, thankfully, is no. But what you do need, which is often neglected, is a solid understanding of the theory behind the models. 

This session will look to do just that, looking at some of the most popular algorithms used today, we will explore the maths involved, to help us understand our problems and get the best results possible. We will be also diving into practical examples, using Databricks to consume a dataset and to visualise results, with R  Python scripts to execute the Machine Learning models. 

If you would like an introduction to the world of Machine Learning and to acquire a solid grounding that will help you develop the skill, then this is the session for you.

##Title: IoT Circus –  deathmatch oops, datematch :) Power Bi vs Time Series Insights##
 
**Abstract**:
Or how to visualize your data and find insights for beginner IoT developer
If you create an IoT solution today, you have a variety of components available to mix and match to make your solution, akin LEGO.
You get your hardware and firmware right and you get data from the sensors, now what? Of course, you would like to have, some data visualization easy and fast, and of course you would like to learn something from that data easy and fast. And it would be nice to have the results available on mobile devices, yes, yes easy and fast.
Now enter our two titan technologies in a match to the death oops data  trying to achieve these goals, you guess it easy fast (and cheap). 
And we will see them clash, from real hardware, to the big Azure cloud, to mobile devices, trying to outmatch each other.

##Title: Parallel Query Processing in SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
Depending on a query plan SQL Server may choose to process a query in a serial or a parallel way. With a parallel query processing a server may utilize more CPUs and complete a query faster, however, managing parallel execution is not simple and demands additional resources, so for some quires a serial execution is better. The balance is important.

In this session we will look at the balance from the Query Processor prospective. We will learn the reasons: how and why does a server choose a parallel or a serial plan. We will learn how to read and interpret parallel plans and look at some important aspects of a parallel plan analysis. After this session you will know what to look at, when the next time you have to deal with parallelism in SQL Server.

##Title: Enterprise Deployment of Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
Many enterprise organisations bought into the self-service gold rush and rolled PowerBI out to their users and let them loose. They now find themselves with a mass of uncontrolled workspaces, hundreds of duplicated reports and the kind of conflicting KPI definitions that started the whole warehousing movement in the first place.

A self service environment for most organisations, is a big cultural and business shift,
this session looks to address how Power BI should be deployed and managed in an Enterprise scenario, along with how to manage business change and what we can do with Power BI to ensure a smooth transition into a the new world of self-service reporting.

##Title: If a computer can understand, why can't YOU understand Azure Cognitive Services?##
 
**Abstract**:
Cognitive services can recognise objects, faces, describe images, understand speech, perform advanced searches and so much more.
If you are a developer and know nothing about Azure Cognitive Services for free, this is a good place to start.
Disclaimer: Cognitive services will never guess a doctor's handwriting. That's just impossible.

Come to this session to get familiar with partition internals and to understand when and how to implement it.

##Title: NotADBTalk##
 
**Abstract**:
You might not need a database... Let's go over some of the problem with databases and what they mean about our software. DBs are implementation detail. If we choose them before we design our software we are going to make mistakes that are costly to correct. In this opinionated talk I am going to cover some of the pitfalls of popular DBs. I am also going to cover how and when to choose a database.

##Title: Power BI as a highway for your AI##
 
**Abstract**:
Everybody talks about AI, many pretend they are using AI but how many people have you really seen doing it? Although AI is at its hype usually if you want to gain a benefit from its adoption you have to invest extensive resources and plan ahead at least several weeks. However the new AI features of Power BI offer extensive analytical capabilities which are easily applicable to a custom scenario even by a casual business user. In this session we will see how Power BI helps us get important insights via AI in a matter of minutes and without a necessity for a serious plunge in the field of statistics.
