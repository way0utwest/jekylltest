##Title: Business Continuity: The Real Reason for HA and DR##
 
**Abstract**:
These days, I've stopped counting how many times I've been approached to help implement feature X because a customer thinks/was told it provides 24x7 for a DB/instance. These decisions often lead to more downtime and less uptme if the technology choice was not right or cannot be administered by the current staff. The secret sauce is not what gets implemented but understanding everything behind the scenes that influences the final architecture based on your actual requirements. It’s less about technology and more about understanding what it will take to keep your business going even when things seems like they are crumbling down around you. This session will cover how to approach achieving business continuity with the right amount of uptime.

##Title: Query Tuning Mastery: Clash of the Row Goals##
 
**Abstract**:
The fight for better performance is a battle of wits: your mind, your intelligence, and your honor pitted against the less-than-dependable whims of the Query Optimizer. But alas, the arbitrary rewrites and clunky hints leveraged by most developers to get around optimization deficiencies make things feel less like a proper duel and more like a skirmish at the sandbox. To truly engage your enemy you must comprehend his inner workings, and in the case of the Query Optimizer, that means you must delve into the mysteries of "row goals." These internal metrics are tracked and enforced within Top iterators--and they exhibit a considerable amount of influence over plan shape and flow, both at compile time and as your query runs. Attend this session to learn how to take charge of optimization, expertly mold your query plans, and gain a new set of tools for eliminating bottlenecks in even your most complex problem queries. En garde!

##Title: DANGER: The Art and Science of Presenting##
 
**Abstract**:
Is there a great difference in the brain chemistry of someone fleeing a hungry mountain lion and someone presenting to a group of colleagues in a corporate board room? The answer is: NO. Over the past decade, a lot has been learned about the chemistry of the brain and why humans react the way we do to events in our environment. The concept of EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is a compelling and growing concept that applies this knowledge in a set of learnable, improvable skills for leading human beings. While EQ is often applied to corporate leadership, the parallels to presenting are fantastic. This session will explain the basics of EQ and demonstrate how you can apply it to make your presentations better in the following areas: * Crafting better slide decks * Preparing yourself for presenting * Delivering your content * Dealing with the unexpected Understanding and practicing the concepts of EQ can make your presentations a better experience for everyone in the room--including you.

##Title: How to Think Like the Engine##
 
**Abstract**:
You’re a developer or a DBA, and you’re comfortable writing queries to get the data you need. You’re much less comfortable trying to design the right indexes for your database server. In this session with Microsoft Certified Master Brent Ozar, you’ll role play as the database engine while Brent gives you queries. You’ll learn first-hand about clustered indexes, nonclustered indexes, execution plans, sargability, statistics, TempDB spills, and T-SQL anti-patterns.

##Title: Database Development using SQL Server Data Tools##
 
**Abstract**:
In 2007, Microsoft introduced Data Dude for Visual Studio 2005 to help bring the processes, controls and tools for code management to Database Development that Application developers had been enjoying for ages.  It had its problems, but it mostly worked and was a welcome step in the right direction. Many versions later we have SQL Server Data Tools for Visual Studio 2013 (and 2012 and 2010...). A more mature product that finally brings database development up to par with traditional application development and has many features data geeks, like ourselves, will truly love. This talk will provide an overview of SSDT’s features and show you how to get started using it to save time, implement better code controls and be a better DBA or database developer.

##Title: Choose Your Geospatial Mapping Adventure##
 
**Abstract**:
You have geospatial data and you know that plotting it on a map will deliver insights. Or maybe you keep hearing “geospatial” as a current BI buzzword and you want to be informed about your options when you get to it. The Microsoft BI stack provides several options for visualizing location data. But how do you know which tool will best serve your purpose, or what factors are important in making this decision? We’ll identify factors to consider when choosing a tool to visualize your data in maps such as system requirements, availability and type of location data, required level of technical understanding, and more. You’ll leave the session confident in your ability to choose the best tool within Excel and SQL Server.

##Title: How to properly gather performance counter data using Windows PowerShell##
 
**Abstract**:
We DBA´s know how important it is to collect performance data. In this session, I will show to you how to properly use the native Get-Counter PowerShell cmdlet to get all information you need from your servers. It has never been as easy to collect performance counter data and save it to a CSV file or a SQL Server table for baselining and later analysis. You may be thinking "But I don’t know nothing about PowerShell and explicitly using .NET classes in my code". Don’t worry; you don’t need to know this to collect counters. Although this is a 100-level session, you’ll be producing 400-level results and your scripts will scale as the number of servers increase, because we’ll use asynchronous collection and processing. And better yet, we’ll schedule all of it. All this using native PowerShell cmdlets and a minimal amount of script code.

##Title: SQL Server Features That Will Blow Your Mind!##
 
**Abstract**:
How many lines of code does it take to generate a running total?  How would you find a value in the next row of data - without using a cursor or loop?  How can you efficiently store rows of data with a lot of optional fields, and how can you quickly find which of those rows have values?  And how can you eliminate locking without resorting to dirty reads?  SQL Server has answers for all of these questions, and none requires more than a few lines of code.  Give me an hour, and I will blow your mind!

##Title: Introducing Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft has brought business intelligence to the cloud. What does this mean and how does this work? In this session, we'll review the BI components available in the cloud BI stack. We'll also compare and contrast functionality of the cloud BI tools with on-premises tools. After attending this session, you'll have a better understanding of what's possible and whether it's time to launch your BI-in-the-cloud solution.

##Title: Extending SQL Server with Advanced Analytics and R##
 
**Abstract**:
The Microsoft SQL Server stack provides an excellent set of tools for storing, visualizing, and analyzing data, but sometimes we want to do more. In this session, we’ll take a look at the open-source statistical software R and how we can use it to connect to SQL Server, analyze data, and put the results of our analysis back into SQL Server for later use. We’ll look at examples of analyses performed by a fictional company as they segment their customers, forecast their sales, and examine interesting relationships among their product offerings. Along the way, we’ll see what some of these analyses would take if done in SQL Server itself and why R is so effective when paired with SQL Server.

##Title: Working with Data in Windows Azure##
 
**Abstract**:
The Windows Azure Platform provides a plethora of options for data storage and trying to make sense of it all can be overwhelming. In this session we will explore the many Azure data services including Windows Azure SQL Database , Azure Storage, Local Storage and Caching. We will walk through the scenarios that each storage service addresses. Next we will dig into how to use each storage service and how they can complement each other when used together. Finally, we will explore the pricing and economic drivers that encourage one storage service over another when multiple fit into your solution.

##Title: Designing a Restore Strategy##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you back up your databases? If the answer is yes (and I really hope it is), do you test your restores? If a table gets dropped at 1:53PM, can you restore the database to 1:52PM using log backups? Can you use the WITH STANDBY parm to apply log backups to a read-only copy of a database?

For the answers to these questions and a whole lot more about database restores, plus some nifty scripts, join me for this presentation.

##Title: In-Memory Columnstore Indexes--Make Your Data Warehouse Fly ##
 
**Abstract**:
Columnstore indexes were introduced in SQL Server 2012, along with a new type of query processing "batch mode". In SQL 2014 they get even better--we can use a Columnstore index as a clustered index and update it. In this session we will explore the basics and beyond of Columnstore indexes and how they can help your warehouse performance. We will also examine their impact to insert and update performance, and the best use cases for implementation.

##Title: Self Service Pitfalls ##
 
**Abstract**:
Every Business Department, BI Developer,  BI Sales Consultant can put together a snazzy Power Pivot Demo and even prettier Power View Dashboard. They will wow you with capabilities and even convince you that Self Service BI can cure all that ails your organization. And while these tools are very powerful and provide huge benefit to organizations when used properly, in the wrong hands they can cause chaos and confusion. In this session we will discuss common pitfalls when implementing Self Service BI. We will discuss important issues such as Data Quality, Data Security,  Properly defining Roles and Responsibilities for end users. Yes, at the end of the day Self-Service BI is very powerful and a GREAT asset to organization, however implementing it properly is more important than the pretty Power View Visualization the sales person shows you!

##Title: The Modern Analytics Architecture##
 
**Abstract**:
The traditional data warehouse has been around a long time, and it isn’t going away anytime soon. However, with other options such as Hadoop and new analytic and data mining techniques, the warehouse is no longer the center of our business analytics universe. In this session, we will cover these new platforms and our approach for integrating them into your warehouse environment.

##Title: Every Byte Counts: Why Your Data Type Choices Matter##
 
**Abstract**:
Ever encounter a table consisting only of BIGINT, CHAR(255), and NVARCHAR(MAX) columns?  Did your gut tell you that this is bad, but you had difficulty explaining why?  Did you know that these Datatype Choices can be a real performance killer?  Attend this session, learn how database records are stored within SQL Server, and why all data types are not created equal.  Armed with that knowledge, we will then explore several performance scenarios that may be impacting your systems right now!  When you leave, you should be able to explain why datatype choices matter to your colleagues, assess your own systems, and implement some best practices to mitigate these performance killers.

##Title: SQL Audit - auditing doesn't have to be boring##
 
**Abstract**:
Let's face it, auditing isn't fun.  But if you're a DBA, you need to know what's going on in your SQL Server instance.  Fortunately, SQL Audit makes it easy.  In this session, we'll cover what you can and can't audit using SQL Audit, enhancements in 2012, configuring database and server audits, ways to process output, and ideas for how to implement SQL Audit on a larger scale.  Auditing doesn't have to be hard.  And with the help of a little custom coding, it can even be fun.

##Title: Master Data Services##
 
**Abstract**:
Does your company have similar data in multiple locations? Not really sure which set of data is accurate? With MDS, Microsoft gives you the ability to have one accurate source of non-transactional data to use with your applications or send to other databases and ETL processes. Leverage data stewards to help manage the data repository to ensure it is up-to-date and accurate. In this session we will cover MDS from start to finish including installation, creating models/entities, working with data, using the Excel add-in, security, hierarchies, views, versions, and business rules. After this session, you should have a good understanding of what MDS does, how to use it, and how to get started with your own MDS project.

##Title: Best Practices for Database Deployment##
 
**Abstract**:
The easiest part of any deployment is running the deployment script on production. But what have you done to prepare that script for production? Was the script tested? Is the script tightly coupled with the application code?

The difference between a successful deployment and a failed or problematic deployment is all the preparation work you've done to ensure that you're deploying the right script, the right way to your production environment. This session will explore best practices that you can implement to ensure that your deployments are as successful as they can be.

##Title: When Cluster and Virtualization Aren't Enough: How to Create an Application Availability Framework##
 
**Abstract**:
Join us for a talk on how to create an application availability framework for any SQL Server implementation. Clustering and virtualization solved some of the issues around high availability, but then these "infrastructure-up" approaches raised new challenges, including rigid configuration rules and restrictions, expensive software stacks, and complex operational models. In this webinar, we'll show you how you can focus on what matters most- your applications. Whether or not your environment already uses virtualization or clustering, this webinar will show you how to create an application availability framework that provides heterogeneous instance mobility from anything to anything, anywhere - truly physical, virtual, OS,  SQL Server version agnostic. Ready for a new approach to assured availability? Attend this talk to learn how.

##Title: Fast and Flexible Applications with Better Database Design##
 
**Abstract**:
Are you a jack of all trades?  Have you been writing application code AND designing databases?  Are you spending lots of time altering your tables knowing there has just got to be a better way?  This beginner session will take a tour through common pitfalls in database designs, discuss the repercussions of lacking standards, prove out consistency issues and help you keep your applications fast and flexible.  A properly designed database should perform at the highest levels and not require a gargantuan effort to adapt to routine application growth.

##Title: Pig\Hive - All That's New is Old Again##
 
**Abstract**:
Pig and Hive sound strange and exotic, but what are they?  As a SQL Server DBA you'll find these two technologies to be quite familiar and easy to learn. Why?  Because both were created for you. If you are a SQL Server DBA and you have to manage data in Hadoop, Pig and Hive may be your first tools of choice. This session will demystify both with clear examples and demos.

##Title: DBA 911 - Database Corruption##
 
**Abstract**:
Database corruption is simply a fact of a DBA's life - if you haven't seen it yet, you will. Success or failure depends on having a solid plan to deal with different types of corruption.  In this session, we will discuss usage of related DBCC commands, monitoring for corruption with SQL Agent Alerts and Jobs, and when to restore versus repair. After attending this session, you will be able to check for corruption, identify different types of corruption, and take the appropriate measures for dealing with it.

##Title: Managing SQL Server Performance with Extended Events##
 
**Abstract**:
One of a DBA's primary responsibilities is managing the performance of a SQL Server environment. When performance problems arise, DBAs need to have the correct tools in place to be able to dig in and discover the issues that are occurring. Although it's one of the newer tools in the DBA toolbox, Extended Events is one of the most powerful tools available. In this session, we will discuss performance management responsibilities for DBAs and provide a foundation, through Extended Events, to understand and resolve performance issues.

##Title: Hybrid Solutions: The Future of SQL Server Disaster Recovery##
 
**Abstract**:
The cloud is a polarizing buzzword in IT, especially for DBAs. The reality is that all of us will be affected by it over the next few years in one way or another much like we have been by virtualization. One of the best uses for the cloud is creating disaster recovery easier than we have been able to do in the past. This session will discuss the cloud from a SQL Server DBA perspective and how things like hybrid on premise/cloud solutions can be architected today to bring resiliency to current solutions with features like availability groups in SQL Server 2012 and 2014.

##Title: Squeezing Top Performance from Your Virtualized SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
Just about anyone can click through a SQL Server installation and get it working, but more than a little  tuning is required to get the most performance out of your servers. Once virtualized, additional tuning can help get even more performance out of that virtual machine. David Klee (@kleegeek) will discuss valuable details for both VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V on how to tweak and tune your virtual infrastructure for business-critical virtualized SQL Servers. Tips on configuring your SQL Server installations for maximum performance when virtualized will be covered in detail.

##Title: Forward the Federations##
 
**Abstract**:
If you are working with Windows Azure SQL Database (WASD) then you know that the way to scale large data sets is to use federations. If you were using SSIS to move data into a federated database you know how challenging this can be. This year Microsoft released a new SSIS component that handles a lot of the federated headache. I'll give the steps you need to set up federations in your WASD database and how to use SSIS to fill the tables with data.

##Title: Eureka! Visual deep dive into storage internals##
 
**Abstract**:
Sometimes half the battle in computing is just to see what's happening. We will take a visual tour of physical database storage structures, using live demos with the freeware application SQL Server File Layout Viewer and our old friends the DBCC commands as guides. See what happens in a data file when you convert a table from a heap to a clustered index! See fragmentation and the havoc wrought by Shrink! Marvel at the behavior of multiple files and filegroups! Index Rebuilds! Eureka!

##Title: Spatial Data: Cooler Than You'd Think!##
 
**Abstract**:
Spatial data has been around since 2008 but it should fire it's PR person.  It's too bad that spatial data gets no love, it's actually something that pretty much all SQL Server shops could use.  This session will focus on utilizing these native types to store, analyze, and retrieve spatial data.  I will use some real world examples to help get the wheels turning on how you can use it within your organization and show how powerful it can be to see your data visually on a map.

##Title: Query Tuning Superstardom for Beginners##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session aimed at the novice query tuner we'll explore what big results may be yielded through the smallest of query tweaks. We will explore impacts of removing unnecessary joins, predicate blunders and problems with returning too much information.  The end result is to improve those bad queries and make you look like a tuning superstar.

##Title: SSIS: The DBA Multiplier ##
 
**Abstract**:
ever wanted to create clones of yourself to get all your work done faster? I will demonstrate how SSIS can help you perform your DBA tasks as if there were more than one of you. You will leave the session knowing how to use SSIS to automate tasks such as performance monitoring above (and below) the normal health checks and transporting databases from one environment to another. You will also learn how SSIS can be used in assisted HA and DR failover strategies as well as backup solutions that go beyond the simple BACKUP statement. We’re going to take SSIS and make it a standard tool for your administrative tasks!

##Title: Introduction to Big Data##
 
**Abstract**:
Political campaign predication, Google Flu trend, DNA sequencing, public sentiment on Twitter, and should I add ginger to the dish I am experimenting with? All the aforementioned topics have something in common: they use Big Data to help us understand this world and make intelligent decisions.

In this session, I will talk about some use cases of Big Data and the technologies behind the scene that enables it: Cloud computing, Hadoop/MapReduce, NoSQL, machine learning, statistics modeling, and such. I will also talk about what we this mean to data professionals like us and what we need to learn to face these challenges
