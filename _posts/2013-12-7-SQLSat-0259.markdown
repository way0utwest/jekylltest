##Title: Конкуренция за ресурсы в многоядерных системах.##
 
**Abstract**:
В настоящее время все больше старых серверов с небольшим количеством ядер выводятся из эксплуатации и заменяются современными многоядерными системами, основанными на архитектуре NUMA.  В таких системах все чаще можно наблюдать конкуренцию при доступе к различным системным объектам в связи с параллельным выполнением большого количества запросов. В докладе пойдет речь о LATCHах и SPINLOCKах, основных типах проблем, связанных с конкурентным доступом, и методах их решения.

##Title: BigData -NoSQL - MongoDB##
 
**Abstract**:
BigData is nowdays bottleneck in the current systems. SQL can't provide a good way to store and treat a huge amount of data.   NoSQL databases were designed to support BigData. MongoDB is one of the NoSQL databases, which is easy-scalable, productive and free for most of the cases.
This session is about MongoDB in general and in comparison with MS SQL Server vendor.

Will be very interesting! I promise ;)

##Title: SQL Server Reporting Services - дюжина советов##
 
**Abstract**:
Существует много полезных мелочей, о которых не подозревают разработчики отчетов. напрмер, все привыкли, что отчёты в SSRS получаются статическими. Но использование встраиваемого программного кода позволяет не только упростить последующее внесение изменений в отчёты, но и создать интерактивные отчёты. Например, можно реализовать функционал, похожий на срезы в Excel 2010. В докладе мы рассмотрим 12 интересных и полезных возможностей SSRS.

##Title: Оптимизация использования памяти для запросов##
 
**Abstract**:
Речь пойдет о Workspace Memory (Query Memory) - той памяти, которая выделяется запросу на время его выполнения. Я расскажу, что это такое, как происходит выделение, с какими проблемами можно столкнуться, если статистика не совсем точно отражает распределение данных в таблице. Мы поговорим также об одновременно выполняющихся запросах и как можно с помощью Resource Governor оптимально скорректировать их выполнение.

##Title: Внутри оптимизатора: стоимость и планы выполнения##
 
**Abstract**:
В основу оптимизатора SQL Server положено понятие стоимости планов выполнения запроса (cost based query optimization). Именно стоимость определяет выбор того или иного оператора в плане и число предпринимаемых усилий для поиска оптимального варианта. В докладе будут рассмотрены некоторые механизмы, используемые оптимизатором для вычисления стоимости, а также решения оптимизатора, принимаемые на ее основе.
