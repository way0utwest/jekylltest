##Title: Somebody Got BIDS Helper in My Data Tools##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you develop SSIS packages, SSRS reports or SSAS models (multidimensional or tabular)? Then this session is for you! We'll cover the capabilities this free tool provides as well as address some of the grating little quirks of BIDS/SSDT. Learn how to get a roles report or printer-friendly dimension usage from Analysis Services Multidimensional. Regain missing functionality in SSAS Tabular such as drillthrough actions, display folders, and HideMemberIf. Delete dataset cache files in SSRS to work around an annoying “feature”. Extend your SSIS capabilities: deploy packages from BIDS/SSDT, identify items with configuration/expressions, create packages based on templates, and find differences between packages. Learn about this perfect combination from Meagan Longoria and Bill Fellows and you'll never want to have your BIDS without the Helper again.

##Title: One is the Loneliest Number: Scaling out your Data Warehouse##
 
**Abstract**:
If your current data warehouse is overworked and underpaid, maybe it needs a friend to share the load. Do you want to be able to scan your 1TB fact table in 20 seconds? Do you want to maintain performance even if data volumes triple without rewriting any code? Do you want a data warehouse which extends to the cloud? 

This demo heavy session will be a deep dive into scaling out your data warehouse onto the Analytics Platform System appliance from Microsoft and querying it with familiar T-SQL. You will learn performance tuning best practices for taking advantage of a distributed data warehouse. See demos of hybrid connectivity to Azure Blob Storage through a technology called Polybase and learn how a modern data warehouse can handle structured data, semi-structured data, and streaming data.

##Title: Rise of the Machine (Learning) – Azure ML in BI, in Apps, and as a product in Azure Marketplace##
 
**Abstract**:
Machine Learning no longer requires expensive infrastructures and knowledge of specialized statistical coding languages. Azure ML lowers the barriers of entry for predictive analytics using Machine Learning.  In this session, review the similarities and differences of Machine Learning compared to traditional Predictive Analytics, Data Mining, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence. I will demonstrate how a BI solution using only Excel with Power Pivot can connect to an Azure ML Model in the cloud for predictions and new types of analysis. Learn how Azure ML can be used to add value to Apps. Also, review ways to turn your Azure ML Model into a source of revenue using Azure Marketplace. Machine Learning is now quietly rising all around us as it integrates with technology, improves processes and workflows, and transforms how data drives business. Empower your organization with new competitive advantages using Azure ML.

##Title: SQL Geography DataTypes and Applications in BI##
 
**Abstract**:
At some point in your SQL life you will be asked to calculate or visualize geospatial data.  Microsoft SQL server has unique optimizations and frameworks for handling just this circumstance.  Not to be confused with Geometric data (square and linear), Geographic data offers even more complexity as you deal with the curvature of the earth and its radial impact on queries.  Jared Nielsen is the Principal of the FUZION Agency and the CTO of Online and Digital for Universal Weather and Aviation and contends with geographic data on a daily basis.  FIR Boundary intersection, optimized flight planning, weather map overlay and multi-level airspace computations all involve some very interesting SQL Server geographic manipulations that may be interesting for you to experience if you haven't already.  Please join me for an in-depth review with helpful resources to guide you on your way as you incorporate Geospatial data into your own applications.

##Title: Overcoming Chartaphobia: Moving Your Organization Toward Interesting and Enlightening Data Viz##
 
**Abstract**:
Do your organization's reports consist mostly of giant tables of data? Perhaps you have gotten as far as adding KPI indicators or conditional highlighting to the tables. Although tables of data presented as reports are commonly found in many organizations, they may be doing you and your users a disservice. You should optimize your data viz just as you optimize your databases. Reports are a user interface that must be purposefully designed to help users achieve their goal of making informed decisions. In this session, we'll review some data viz best practices and apply those concepts to the use of Microsoft reporting tools such as Excel, Power View, and Reporting Services. You'll leave with guidance on how to take boring, unreadable tables of data and turn them into useful and visually appealing reports.

Rather than accepting the status quo, I believe in learning everything, and nothing, and mixing it all together until you have a strange, unique and ethereal blend of technology, marketing, knowledge, wisdom, creativity, passion, charity, caring, and humility. I think that being uncategorizable is the goal since life is the voyage, not the destination, so too should work be that extension of the undefinable so you

##Title: Building Bullet-Resistant SSIS Packages##
 
**Abstract**:
It's 2:30 a.m., and you've just gotten that call no ETL developer wants to get: an SSIS package has failed unexpectedly. Immediately, you start asking yourself: "What could have caused this?", "What do I do to fix the data from this failed execution?", and, most importantly, "Could I design the package in such a way that this doesn't happen again?"

In this demo-packed session, we will examine the design patterns and logistics of building error-resistant SSIS packages. Starting with the control flow, we'll work through various tools and patterns that can be used to prevent, or at least handle appropriately, task-level errors. We'll then move to the data flow, and discuss and demonstrate how to proactively address problem data to prevent unexpected package failures.

##Title: Big Data Analytics with Excel##
 
**Abstract**:
This introductory session describes and demonstrates how to create a big data analytics solution with structured data by using Azure HDInsight and Excel 2013. This session will be of interest to those new to the concept of big data, new to self-service data modeling with Power Pivot, and for those interested to understand how big data can play a role in a self-service BI solution. Demonstrations will reinforce the introductory theory by showing how to store data files, and how to use Pig to transform data, and Hive to query data. The “big data” will then be retrieved and queried by using Power BI add-ins in Excel 2013, including Power Query, Power Pivot and Power View.

##Title: Row-Based Security in SSRS and SSAS##
 
**Abstract**:
It is relatively straight-forward to grant a user access to a particular SSRS report, multi-dimensional cube, or tabular model table, but what happens when the user needs access to the object but should be denied access to view certain rows of data?  In this session we'll investigate a real-world solution to this common BI problem.

##Title: BI Basics - Finding Return on Data##
 
**Abstract**:
This session will you chart the waters through the sea of Business Intelligence (BI) options.  IT departments need tools to turn data into useful information for users.  Instead of ROI, this session talks about Return on Data' for IT Managers.  

In this session we look at the roles of data warehousing, big data and business intelligence systems.  The Microsoft BI stack has evolved from traditional OLAP cubes to include tabular models, PowerBI, integration with HADOOP, reporting tools and full integration with SharePoint.  This session is non-technical.

##Title: Building your ETL Framework with BIML##
 
**Abstract**:
BIML makes SSIS development faster and creates reusable modules that help you apply a consistent ETL framework across solutions. In this session, we will write BIML and use it to build an SSIS package. You'll see how BIML allows you to avoid corrupted metadata and the tedious repetition of implementing simple SSIS patterns, freeing you up to take on new and interesting ETL challenges. Then we will review how to use it to create an extensible ETL framework.

Microsoft has provided some great tools for creating and editing SSIS packages.  First Business Intelligence Development Studio (BIDS) then SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT).  However, when creating an SSIS package you frequently repeat the same steps over and over.  BIML is an XML markup language designed for representing the structure of an SSIS package.  BIML Script takes that structure and generates an SSIS package.In this session we will use BIDS Helper to create a simple SSIS package using BIML.  We will handle a couple SSIS scenarios with BIML and BIML Script.
