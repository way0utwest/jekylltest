##Title: Introducing Azure Data Factory##
 
**Abstract**:
Who needs to move data around? Everyone, of course. Whether we're moving data on-premises or in the cloud, Microsoft's Azure Data Factory (ADF) service is a great way to compose and manage the pipelines that transform data inside and between our systems. ADF integrates well with existing Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) frameworks while closing the gaps left by data-UNaware task schedulers. In this introductory, highly-interactive session, you'll learn how ADF can help you visualize, define and manage data as it moves around, no matter whether that's on-premises, in the cloud or in between the two. Even though this is an introductory session, basic familiarity with common ETL and task-scheduling concepts is recommended.

##Title: SS2014 In-Memory Tables:  Formula 1 Performance Unleashed!##
 
**Abstract**:
Query performance is what it is all about.  SQL Server 2014 now has the new in-memory functionality that takes a completely different approach to data access and manipulation.  Google “In-Memory Tables” and you’ll get a myriad of results from white papers, blogs, webinars, etc.  This session will consolidate the relevant information from all these sources so the production DBA/Developer will be able to understand, create, use, maintain, and trouble-shoot in-memory table functionality.  This session will also examine several demo scripts showing performance gains using the in-memory tables over equivalent disk based tables.  
This session is all about when and how to apply in-memory tables in a production environment.
After this session you will
1.	 Understand what in-memory tables are and how to create and maintain them including their limitations
2.	Be able to identify performance gains over equivalent disk back tables
3.	Comprehend the new data monitoring needed for in-memory table

##Title: Introduction to Time Series Forecasting##
 
**Abstract**:
Imagine taking historical sales data and using data science to accurately predict future sales values. This is precisely the objective of time series forecasting – to predict future values based on previously observed values.

This session will introduce time series forecasting, and describe how different Microsoft BI products enable forecasting for various audiences, including the business analysts, IT developer, and even the Information Worker.

Topics will include Analysis Services forecasting by using the Microsoft Time Series algorithm with the Excel add-ins (Table Analysis Tools and the Client Tools), SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) and script. This session will also introduce and describe the impressive new forecasting capabilities delivered in Power View with Office 365. As part of Microsoft’s new approach to simplify complex Machine Learning technology, forecasting in Power View enables powerful forecasting capabilities for the unspecialized Information Worker.

##Title: SQL Server 2014/2016 In Memory Technologies - OLTP (aka Hekaton)  ColumnSt##
 
**Abstract**:
With the advent of new hardware servers with hundreds of Gigabytes of RAM memory and incredibly faster CPUs with multi-core dies Microsoft has catapulted SQL Server above competitors with some new In Memory technologies. Did you ever want to have no locking, no blocking, no latch? For highly transactional systems, In Memory OLTP can boost performance 10x by hosting a table in memory and compiling the stored procedure in C code/DLL. Did you ever wanted to have queries return blazing fast for slow changing data? Updatable ColumnStore index allows for quick results to be returned as massive compression on the column exist and data is kept in RAM. 
Having participated in SQL14/SQL15/Hekaton TAP, I'll be showing demo on both of these technologies, gotchas, best practices.

##Title: Mission Possible: Interactive Performance Troubleshooting - Index##
 
**Abstract**:
Performance troubleshooting is detective work. We'll have a lab system being assaulted by PowerShell scripts  (to simulate live users), and simulated performance problems like those that can make your on-call cell phone ring too much! Do you think you have what it takes to find these "needle in the haystack" issues and resolve them quickly?  This will be a highly interactive session where we will locate the rogue queries together, work through solutions, implement them and measure the results.  In this episode we'll focus primarily on improper indexing as a common underlying problem and all will walk away with much better troubleshooting skills and an upgraded knowledge of performance tuning!

##Title: The Data Warehouse of the Future##
 
**Abstract**:
So you think you have the ultimate Data Warehouse...well think again.   The landscape or should I say the data lake is changing constantly.   We are getting data from all over the place.   How do we make it available and relevant for the consumers of a data warehouse.   Is Kimbell obsolete now, what about unstructured data, how about the gazillioin rows of click data, etc.   So the data and BI architects are all on suicide watch.    Well its not really that bad.   Microsoft has woken up and seen all that is going and has brought functionality to SQL Server to solve some of these issues.   This presentation provides an overview of technologies such as Polybase, Temoporal Tables, Columnstore Index, In memory tables, JSON support, etc.   that can be utilized to build the data warehouse of the future.

##Title: Introduction to Biml##
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever needed to generate dozens (or even hundreds) of similar SSIS packages? Do you ever find yourself needing to regenerate a lot of packages when some piece of the upstream data format changes? Using native SSIS, this can be a tedious and error prone exercise. However, using Biml (Business Intelligence Markup Language) can greatly increase your productivity as an ETL developer.

In this session, we'll cover the essentials of Biml. I'll discuss what it is and what it can do for SSIS, demonstrating how it can easily generate dozens or even hundreds of packages in just a few minutes. I'll also demonstrate some realistic examples and discuss how Biml fits into the enterprise ETL picture.

##Title: Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort.  Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables?  Need to move 500 databases to a different drive?  Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds.  I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes.  Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you.
Here you’ll learn:
•	The most useful regular expression commands.
•	The appropriate times to use regular expressions.
•	How to use regular expressions to write code for you.
•	How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.

##Title: "Can I Get A Report of This?":  Introduction to SSRS##
 
**Abstract**:
In the day-to-day operations of business, how often have we heard or even asked someone the question ourselves, “Can I get a report of this?”  Regardless of your area of expertise, reporting has become a necessity and requirement among businesses and is impacting our roles as IT professionals.  With the huge wave of trendy reporting tools and software surrounding the BI industry, many people are unaware or often overlook SSRS as a reporting solution.  In this session, we will look at the features and capabilities of SSRS, as well as supply you with the tools to begin fulfilling basic report requests.   At the conclusion of this session, you will know the difference between Report Builder and SQL Server Data Tools to determine which one is suitable for your needs.  You will also be able to create and deploy a basic report consisting of a data source, data set, a parameter and a row group.

##Title: Testing SSIS Packages##
 
**Abstract**:
Senior developer: “How do you test your code?” Junior developer: “I compile it.” It’s an old joke, but too often this reflects the reality of testing. If the code compiles, it has passed its test. Sadly, this principle is sometimes applied to Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes as well: “When the SSIS package runs without error, testing is complete.” 

As in software development, testing of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages should not end at when the package executes successfully. You must also confirm that the package does what it was intended to do without placing an undue performance burden on the system.

This session walks through design patterns for testing SSIS packages during and after the development process. The session covers topics such as these:
* Performance testing
* Patterns for validating execution results at runtime
* Validating package metadata before execution
* Design time versus runtime testing
* Making a graceful exit: testing for error handling

##Title: Designing Stored Procedure Solutions##
 
**Abstract**:
With a little T-SQL experience, you can create a stored procedure that completes a task. But it's harder to formulate a stored procedure solution with the big picture in mind. In this session, we will work through a real world scenario to develop a thorough solution. You will learn about: 

Asking the right questions to set yourself up for success
Making the case for stored procedures over ad hoc code and other objects
Pro tips for standardization and cross-version compliance
Reevaluating and expanding on your solution
Limiting inputs to reduce unexpected behaviors and errors
Choosing between alternate solutions
Evaluating for performance

This session is for data professionals who can write T-SQL, but haven't spent a lot of time in SQL development.

##Title: Changing Your Habits to Improve the Performance of Your T-SQL##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you dread handing your T-SQL over for code review? Do your queries run slower than you expect? Does the DBA always want to tweak your T-SQL? In this demo heavy session, we’ll take a look at various ways to improve your T-SQL. You’ll learn about formatting T-SQL for readability and why top down design is not the best solution for writing T-SQL. You’ll learn why implicit conversions slow queries down and how to leverage simple techniques for minimizing the performance impact of explicit conversions. By changing some of your T-SQL writing habits you can improve performance of queries from the very beginning.

##Title: Using Power BI when Implementing Data Analytics Management Practices##
 
**Abstract**:
Providing the tools to implement data analytics is only one part of a successful project.  Collaboration policies, data management roles, security, and training are all necessary to ensure the wide adoption of data based decision making throughout your organization. Business Analytics projects regularly require interaction with the technical teams who are responsible for ensuring the security, access and storage of the data. During this session we will discuss practices and methods learned to foster and continue good collaborative relationships between technical and analytics teams. The Power BI collaboration tools are used to illustrate the methods needed to encourage users to adopt data driven decision making in your organization.  Attendees will leave the session with a methodology which they can implement in their environments to promote successful data based decision making based on proven methods provided to a number of clients in a number of industries.

##Title: Enforce Best Practices with CMS and Policy Based Management##
 
**Abstract**:
You have a lot of servers and need to make sure you have consistent settings configured like disabling auto shrink, disabling extended stored procedures, or enabling database mail.  I'll show you how to check those settings across all your servers with Central Management Server and how you can manage a disperse environment.  You will learn how to leverage the power of Policy Based Management to enforce those settings and standards in your enterprise.  Best of all, you will see how to get alerts sent to you when one of your settings is changed.

##Title: Database Design Throwdown##
 
**Abstract**:
Everyone agrees that great database performance starts with a great database design. Unfortunately, not everyone agrees which design options are best. Data architects and DBAs have debated database design best practices for decades. Systems built to handle current workloads are unable to maintain performance as workloads increase.

Attend this new and improved session and join the debate about the pros and cons of database design decisions. This debate includes topics such as logical design, datatypes, primary keys, indexes, refactoring, code-first generators, and even the cloud. Learn about the contentious issues that most affect your end users and how to avoid them.

##Title: Know what your machines are doing besides SQL Server - WMI, WQL, and PoSH##
 
**Abstract**:
There's far more happening on your Windows servers than just SQL Server, and looking at ERRORLOG won't show you the whole story: other applications stealing your memory, OS issues, hardware errors, and more.  We'll start by looking at different ways to collect Event Logs.  From there we'll delve into WMI and WQL, which allow us to query servers (remotely or locally) to get information such as performance statistics, System and Event Logs, and even changes within SQL Server.

We'll finish it off with two immediately-usable implementations you can set up on Monday.

##Title: Parameter Sniffing the Good, the Bad and the Ugly##
 
**Abstract**:
Parameter sniffing is something that more than often helps performance on your servers; however, there are times when it can hinder performance as well. In this session we will define exactly what parameter sniffing is, and examine when it is good and when it is bad. Lastly, we will explore the different options available to fix bad parameter sniffing. After this session, you will be able to locate and fix bad parameter sniffing when it occurs on your servers.

##Title: Strategies for Working with Texas-sized Databases##
 
**Abstract**:
Very large databases (VLDBs), or just "databases" as they're known in Texas, are just like regular databases, right? There's just more of them to love.

Working with very large databases can be difficult and tricky at times. Everything takes longer, there's more locking, more logging, and minor issues become major very quickly. In this session you will learn some strategies for working with VLDBs such as how to speed up backups and restores, how to fit index maintenance and integrity checks into a thin maintenance window, and how to efficiently and quickly set up failover partners and replicas.

##Title: SQL Server Deprecated and Discontinued Features##
 
**Abstract**:
Support for SQL Server 2005 ends in April 2016 - do you still need to upgrade? Each version of SQL Server provides a list of features which are deprecated – meaning they will be removed in a future version – and a list of features previously deprecated which are discontinued in that version. This session will discuss the deprecated\discontinued features starting with SQL 2008 and will show you how to identify deprecated features so that you can upgrade with ease when those features are discontinued in the version to which you are upgrading.
