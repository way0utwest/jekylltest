## Title: Learning Azure Cosmos DB
 
**Abstract**:
This session presents an overview of Azure Cosmos DB, a globally distributed, massively scalable, low (single-digit millisecond) latency, fully managed NoSQL database service that is designed specifically for modern web and mobile applications. Like other NoSQL platforms, Cosmos DB supports a schema-free data model, built-in partitioning for sustained heavy-write ingestion, and replication for high availability. But only Cosmos DB offers turnkey global distribution, automatic indexing, and SLAs for guarantees on 99.99% availability, throughput, latency, and consistency.

We tour many features of Cosmos DB, including its multi-model capabilities which allow you to store and query schema-free JSON, graph, key/value, and columnar data models. You’ll learn about global distribution, scale-out partitioning, tunable consistency, custom indexing, and more. We’ll also explore client development using the many available SDKs and APIs. Attend this session, and get up to speed on Cosmos DB toda

## Title: The fact that I am an old Database Server does not mean I have no memory problems
 
**Abstract**:
Having enough memory is critical to SQL Server's performance, in this session we will try to answer some questions:
how SQLOS of SQL Server manage its memory?
SQL Server is using all of the memory available for it on the server, but is it enough? 
What could be wrong if SQL Server will have too much memory?
Why Doesn’t SQL Server Release Memory?
How to identify when the system was under external and/or internal memory pressure?
What are the RING_BUFFER_RESOURCE_MONITOR telling me?
Who is filling my memory?
How much server memory is being wasted by storing empty space?
Large-page memory (trace flag 834) could it help Columnstore indexes?
How much memory can a single session have?
What can I do with Out Of Memory error?

## Title: Speak your hands – using body language for effective presentations
 
**Abstract**:
Your body language can be a great asset to your presentation skills, and it can also be a good reason your presentation is relegated to the bottom of the scrap heap. Why is it that some speakers make you feel warm and fuzzy, like you instantly like them, while other speakers make you want to leave? Science tells us time and again that the nonverbal part of communication is a very important and significant, but still surprisingly few speakers – especially technical speakers – give it much thought.

 In this hour I go through several pointers for using your hands to convey and reinforce your message. I give ample examples of both good and bad body language and show you several tips and tricks to seriously enhance your stage presence.  Attend this session to learn about how body language can make sure you convey what you think you do!

## Title: The extraordinary effect of Python support in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Python is one of the most popular languages this days and we are very excited to have an ability to use Python inside SQL Server stored procedures starting SQL Server 2017.
If you are Database Administrator - you need to get to know this wonderful feature! Learn how it can solve DBA's everyday challenges when dealing with text and json files, bulk loads and even simplify ETL flows when you need to get data from database systems other than SQL Server. Moreover, you can offload the big data querying to nosql database and use Python to get the results into SQL server. Have you ever dreamed about receiving emails from SQL Server stored procedure? Yes, Python can do that!
This session will answer questions like:

-	Why do I need to learn Python if I am not working with Machine learning?
-	What are the main components that enable external script execution?
-	How are the external scripts isolated?
-	What is the new Launchpad service?
-	What is the bxlserver.exe and Sql Sattelite API ?

## Title: Database Modeling In Practice
 
**Abstract**:
Many times we had created databases according to KISS principle – small set of objects, 3rd NF. Then they were getting more complex, and less efficient. We had to add more features to application, reporting, logging, history lookups. Someday the database became a mess. Oh! If I had known all the demands the day I'd made the first table, I'd have offered a better solution...
In this session, we look at some issues that arise in database modeling. We'll try to look at a database from different angles – model, implementation, performance, application that works with that database and business value. We'll touch a logical and physical design, and such things like an "entity vs attribute" problem, denormalization, table splitting, strategy of primary key implementation, how to provide history of data changes, archiving, etc. 
This session would give you some thoughts and ideas about what to consider when you create a database.

## Title: Azure Elastic Databases  Azure Elastic Jobs
 
**Abstract**:
A single Azure SQL Database gets dedicated resources (DTUs), which determine CPU, Memory, and the read-write rates that are available to use. The cost of each database is predefined according to the service tier and resources we choose, regardless the actual use.
Azure SQL Database Elastic Pool enables to manage and scale multiple Azure SQL Databases as a group. Databases in a pool share resources (eDTUs). It's a powerful and a cost-effective option for databases that have varying and unpredictable usage demands.
During the meetup, we will review “Azure Elastic Pools” and “Azure Elastic Database jobs”, which enable us to execute queries across a group of databases, aggregate data from multiple databases, and improve performance. We will demonstrate the use and discuss cases, which can be optimized by using these features, including a real-life case where we reduce the cost dramatically.
Join the meeting and learn how to improve performance and reduce the cost of your Azure databases

## Title: Azure and SQL Server: Getting the best out of the cloud
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server and Azure are built for each other. New hybrid scenarios between on-premise SQL Server and Azure mean they don't have to exclude each other but instead you can have the best of both worlds, reducing operational costs.
 
For example, by taking advantage of services like Azure Blob Storage or Azure VMs
we can increase the availability of our services or distribute data in smart
ways that benefit our performance and decrease cost.

In this session, you will learn the strongest use cases for hybrid scenarios
between on-premises and the cloud, and open a new horizon of what you can do
with your SQL Server infrastructure.

## Title: SQL Server in the Cloud Panel with Itai Binyamin  Pini Krisher
 
**Abstract**:
If you like it or not (and you should like it), the cloud is here, and we need to leverage it. There are a lot of possibilities and advantages when it comes to working in the cloud. If you would like to migrate your on-premise SQL Server to the cloud, then you have a bunch of options. You can choose between several cloud vendors (e.g. Azure vs. AWS). You can choose between an IaaS solution (a virtual machine running SQL Server) and a PaaS solution (a managed database). There are also many things you need to consider, such as latency and security. If you are considering the cloud, and even if you are already there, join us for a fascinating discussion…

## Title: The Future of the DBA Panel with Lior King  Asaf Aviv
 
**Abstract**:
In the era of cloud, automation, big data and some other hot buzzwords – what does the future role of the DBA look like? Are we even going to need DBAs in the future? And if we do – are we still going to run maintenance plans? Set up disaster recovery solutions? Implement security best practices? And when is that future anyway? One year from now? Five years? More?
Lior King is going to present the keynote in SQL Saturday Israel 2018, and the topic is “The Future of the DBA”. We are going to grab him right after the keynote, and develop a fascinating discussion with him and with the audience. If you are a DBA today, and you are not sure what you are going to be tomorrow, then this session is for you…

## Title: Big Data in SQL Server Panel with Ronen Chenn  Elad Shwarchberg
 
**Abstract**:
Big Data is everywhere these days. There are a lot of Big Data scenarios, from IoT (Internet of Things) to AI (Artificial Intelligence). The common challenge to all of these scenarios is to handle very large volume, velocity and variety of data (a.k.a “the 3 V’s”). There are plenty of data platforms to handle Big Data scenarios. Some of them are NoSQL databases, while others are relational. Some of them are open-source, while others are not. Some are MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) platforms, while others are SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing) platforms. In many cases, SQL Server is not the right choice, and you should learn about other data platforms and choose the best one to handle your workload.
On the other hand, SQL Server offers a lot of features and capabilities to handle Big Data scenarios, and in many cases, it can be the best solution.

## Title: Radically Boosting SQL Queries with GPU Acceleration
 
**Abstract**:
Due to exponentially growing data stores, enterprises often need to pre-aggregate and pre-model their data before they are able to execute analytical queries. In addition, slowdowns and bottlenecks frequently occur at peak processing times with some queries taking hours or some that are simply not possible to execute. This session entitled "Radically boosting SQL queries with GPU acceleration" will demonstrate how the power of GPUs can be leveraged to accelerate SQL queries and the speed to analytical insights. It will also discuss how to scale the amount of raw data analyzed to meet the increasing demands of data scientists and business intelligence professionals alike without the need for pre-aggregation and pre-modeling.

## Title: The freedom to choose. Selecting the correct SQL Server flavor for you
 
**Abstract**:
In the past, choosing the right SQL Server meant that you basically only needed to choose the correct edition. Then came the question whether you going to have it virtualized or not.
Nowadays, while virtualized or not is almost always answered “virtualized”, there are much more questions to answer before you can finalize your decision: where will the database be hosted, will it be on-premise or in the cloud, on windows or on Linux, do I want to create the database engine myself or use a managed database and many more. Join this session to get an overall view of all options available including Azure DB, APS, RDS, Azure IASS, Azure managed instances, hybrid solutions and more. We will talk about the considerations for choosing any of the options and discuss the relative benefits of each.

I've started my career as a developer, but later I've discovered that my true passion lies in data platforms of all kinds (relational and non-relational). Since then I'm a DBA, an instructor, a team leader, a consultant and an architect of data platforms for more than 20 years.
At first I was an Oracle DBA and on 2005 I fell in love with SQL Server and been using it ever since along with other platforms.

Today I work for Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and deal with a wide variaty of platforms including SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, Hadoop, Kafka and MongoDB.
