## Title: Unit Testing Fundamentals 
 
**Abstract**:
How can you be certain the "little change" you're about to make to that stored procedure isn't going to take down your whole company? "Real" developers use a technique called "Unit Testing" to minimize that risk, a concept that's also available to you. With unit testing you can quickly ascertain whether the the changes to functions, stored procedures, and even other objects in your database had a negative unforeseen impact.

In this session we'll walk through the basics of what unit testing is, how to set up a simple Unit Testing project in SSMS, how we can tell whether something has negatively changed in our functions or procedures.  We'll then introduce the tSQLt framework to run our test suite as well as SQL Test from RedGate.

## Title: Data Mining Deep Dive: Clustering
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft SQL Server makes it simple to apply data mining algorithms to a wide variety of data.  Applying the results to business decisions without a thorough understanding of how the algorithms work is dangerous to the bottom line of the business, though.  This session will take one of the algorithms, the Microsoft Clustering Algorithm, and do a deep dive into the mechanics of how it works.  The algorithm is valuable for analyzing data in the fields of marketing, social networks and many others.  The session will also examine the types of data that are valid for clustering.  A demonstration of building a clustering model using SQL Server Analysis Services and viewing the model using the Excel Data Mining Add-In will be given.

## Title: Take Your Data Global with Microsoft BI Data Explorer, GeoFlow, and Power View Maps
 
**Abstract**:
Business Intelligence has now been a global discipline for several years, and with new Microsoft tools you can now bring the globe to Business Intelligence.  Microsoft Data Explorer for Excel 2013 enables you to access, harness, transform, and mash-up data like never before.  Data that is separated by source type, format, location and more will be reviewed and mashed up in Data Explorer.  GeoFlow is a new geospatial Business Intelligence tool which literally adds another dimension to data visualization.  The power of GeoFlow to transform inanimate data into a story will be demonstrated.  Power View for Excel 2013 has the capability to recognize geospatial data and create reports that integrate with Bing Maps, enabling global data BI report development from a desktop computer.  The ease of use, intuitive design, and value of maps with Power View 2013 will be reviewed with some interesting examples leveraging publically available data.  Take your data global…literally.

## Title: Implement a Dynamic Table Partitioning Solution
 
**Abstract**:
Have a large or potentially large database that you would like to partition?  Manually implementing partitioning and the corresponding maintenance can be a lot of work, especially if you have many tables.  In this presentation we look at how you would implement a partitioning solution dynamically for all tables with the designated partition column.  We set it up to keep a FIXED number of file groups.  The partition maintenance will recycle the file groups over time as partitions are dropped and created.  We do as much as possible through dynamic scripting.  This solution can easily be used for archiving but in this example we are simply keeping the most current 6 months of data and dropping the rest.  Assumes you have a basic understanding of SQL Server table partitioning.

## Title: DANGER: The Art and Science of Presenting
 
**Abstract**:
Is there a great difference in the brain chemistry of someone fleeing a hungry mountain lion and someone presenting to a group of colleagues in a corporate board room? The answer is: NO. Over the past decade, a lot has been learned about the chemistry of the brain and why humans react the way we do to events in our environment. The concept of EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is a compelling and growing concept that applies this knowledge in a set of learnable, improvable skills for leading human beings. While EQ is often applied to corporate leadership, the parallels to presenting are fantastic. This session will explain the basics of EQ and demonstrate how you can apply it to make your presentations better in the following areas: * Crafting better slide decks * Preparing yourself for presenting * Delivering your content * Dealing with the unexpected Understanding and practicing the concepts of EQ can make your presentations a better experience for everyone in the room--including you.

## Title: Why are we Waiting..
 
**Abstract**:
An in-depth session examining "Waits" happening in your SQL Servers, using the well-known "Waits  Queues" methodology. 

With particular focus in the session on understanding and interpreting the information found the (DMV) sys.dm_os_wait_stats, 
Taking note of which “Waits “with the highest counts or excessive wait times, as well as those which “Waits” can be safely ignored, 
We can discover those "performance hurdles" and ways to overcome or remove them, restoring your SQL Servers performance levels. 
By using established methodologies like “Waits  Queues”, we can systematically identify and remove performance

## Title: The care and feeding of your adolescent SQL Server.
 
**Abstract**:
Many organizations bring SQL Server into their environment and evolve in their use of it in a similar manner. They may start with extensive use of Microsoft Access and Excel data stores and bring in SQL Server to address the limitations of these products. They may bring in SQL Server to support a departmental application development initiative, or to start a BI project. A developer or server administrator may be pressed into service as a DBA, and as the project or use of the server increases, an improvisational approach to managing the server starts to get cumbersome.
At this stage in the organization’s use of SQL Server, there are a few simple things that can prepare the server for its increasing role in the organization:

## Title: Database Snapshots - Making Your Job Easier
 
**Abstract**:
Want to off load some of that reporting workload, make an emergency rollback during a production upgrade faster, or make managing your test databases easier?  If any of these appeal to you, then you should be familiar with database snapshots within SQL Server.  Available since SQL Server 2005, use of this feature can make your life a lot easier.We'll spend the first part of this session taking an in depth look at how database snapshots work. We’ll look at what exactly is happening behind the scenes when you create a snapshot and when you query a snapshot.  Once we've covered the basics, we'll spend the rest of our time analyzing and discussing a number of real world use cases where snapshots can be very beneficial and save you a great deal of time.

## Title: Temporary Objects Without Permanent Consequences
 
**Abstract**:
Temporary objects like Table Variables and Temporary Tables are not inherently bad, but they are overused and misunderstood by many. Increase your understanding and learn when you should favor a Temporary Table over a Table Variable. We will start with the basics, but also look at execution plans to get a better grasp on the cause of those performance differences. Table-Valued Parameters are implemented as read-only Temporary Tables under the covers, and have some solid use cases. Discover how Table-Valued Parameters can be used to: 1) avoid the dynamic sql used by application code (or t-sql string splitting functions) to allow multi-value selection and 2) dramatically reduce the number of round trips between an application and SQL Server.

## Title: They Say We Shouldn't, But Let’s Do It Anyway – Ad
 
**Abstract**:
You know all of those things that people say you shouldn't do with Tabular models; many-to-many relationships, parent-child hierarchies, actions, etc? Let’s do those! In this session we’ll work through a few scenarios to implement some of the more advanced SSAS Tabular techniques. Not only those things that we often hear we shouldn't do (though there’s often a business case to do them), but also those advanced aspects of Tabular models and the DAX language like dynamical security, using inactive relationships and implementing a direct query model that aren't as frequently implemented. Come join me to try out all of the things we shouldn't.

## Title: Mastering the CUBE Functions in Excel 2013
 
**Abstract**:
This session explores the seven CUBE functions that are natively available in Excel 2013. Unknown to many business analysts, these useful functions can be used to retrieve data model members and values to create parameter-driven report designs.

The session topics will introduce each of the seven functions. Demonstrations will range from the simple, to the more sophisticated involving dynamic expressions, MDX expressions, integration of data from multiple data models, and macro-driven layouts.

This session is a must for those looking to drive more from Excel when reporting from the BI Semantic Model. Much of the content presented in this session is also applicable to Excel 2007 and Excel 2010.

## Title: Agile Data Warehouse - The final frontier 
 
**Abstract**:
Come to this session and learn about why you should always create a data model for enterprise applications. This session will review the benefits and functionality that typically is provided by most data modeling tools. Learn why a data model needs to be more that just a collection of SQL scripts. Many projects try to version their models in a manually manner by generating SQL change scripts and checking them in. This labour intensive process frequently turns out to be not scalable and does not integrate well into the  development process. This session will also share a process that was used to version database changes directly from a data model.
