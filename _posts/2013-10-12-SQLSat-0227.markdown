##Title: Being the Swiss Army Knife of DB Pros##
 
**Abstract**:
Being a specialist means you're really, really good at one thing. Being a generalist means you're good at a a lot of different things. The generalist has an advantage over the specialist because he or she can see and solve problems the specialists can't. In this session I'll cover why it's important to diversify your skill set, not only for career protection, but to be better as a database professional. We'll look at what skill sets to build on to expand your abilities around SQL Server to include the operating system, development, networks, and security. Remember, this saying isn't complete, "Jack of all trades, master of none." The full saying is, "Jack of all trades, master of none, though often times better than master of one."

##Title: Table Vars  Temp Tables - What you NEED to Know!##
 
**Abstract**:
Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"

##Title: SSRS: On Premises or Azure? What's the difference?##
 
**Abstract**:
With a lot of companies looking to the cloud for cost savings, it helps to know what the differences are between on premises and cloud installations of your IT services. In this session, we'll take a look at SQL Server Reporting Services and the feature differences between deploying in the cloud, and deploying on premises. We'll look at different options for where you can deploy your reports as well. Also, Shannon Lowder will help with the associated costs of each solution, as well as preparing you for some of the gotchas you'll face as you move to the cloud today.

##Title: 10 Things all BI System Administrators Should Know##
 
**Abstract**:
Conversations about SQL Server administration tends to be all about administering OLTP systems. If you administrer BI systems, you can't apply everything you know about administering OLTP systems to BI systems. BI systems usually end up being administered by OLTP DBAs or by BI developers and architects. Where does one even find a BI Administrator?

Fortunately, I've been administering BI systems for several years, and I have learned the hard way the difference between administering OLTP and BI systems. This session will cover the top 10 things that I think an administrator of BI systems need to know.

##Title: SQL 2012 Table Compression##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2008 has introduced Table compression to the DBA toolkit.  We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server.  What some may not know is the subtleties of compression.  Such subtleties include that not all Page Compressed tables are entirely page compressed.  This session will show you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level.  At the lower level, this session will also show how to determine compression settings of objects in the database.  Participants will be able to use undocumented commands as well as commands such as PIVOT to derive some interesting information from the database engine.

##Title: Database Health and Performance##
 
**Abstract**:
Everyone knows that sick servers generally do not perform well. But, how well are your servers running? Let’s perform a health and performance check! In this session, we will perform a holistic system health and performance analysis where we dive through common tasks that you should routinely perform. Once the health and performance analysis is completed, a remediation plan is developed. Baselines are established and updated. Coming out of this session, you will have a tried and true methodology for examining your system state, checking for unhealthy components, analyzing performance, and keeping things that way for years to come.

##Title: OnPremise to Azure##
 
**Abstract**:

During this talk I'll walk you through the process actually used to migrate a client's systems from hosted in a company closet to multiple Microsoft Azure data centers. Along the way we'll discuss the planning that went into the migration, the testing we went through, the pain points we hit, all the way to up and running in the cloud. This session covers the roadmap, we won't go through the actual migration itself...that took almost a year to complete.

##Title: “Indexing” Encrypted Data##
 
**Abstract**:
As a SQL Server DBA I see my role having 2 main focuses. First is to protect the data and second is to ensure performance is maximized. More often than not companies forget about data security when they focus on performance tuning. In this presentation I will mention a few cases where encryption could have saved a lot of hassle. I will then demo a method that can be used to "index" commonly searched on encrypted values (ex: SSNs, Credit Card, etc) helping reduce the impact on the performance of a query.

##Title: DBA Task Automation: Unleash the PowerShell Hero in You!##
 
**Abstract**:
As DBAs, we constantly have to stretch our time and budget resources, and the best way to keep up with demands is through process automation. Workflow and PassThru parameters are just two of the features that will allow you to turn complex tasks into simple, repeatable, automated processes easier than you would have ever dreamed possible. And if you’ve had trouble with PowerShell in the past, the auto-completion and eager loading of modules will make your transition to PowerShell hero even simpler. Come see how mid-tone blue can help take your skills to the next level.

##Title: Visualizing Data with Reporting Services##
 
**Abstract**:
Data is beautiful…or at least it can be….This session dives into the art  science behind data visualization. We will start by looking at the research done by Stephen Few and Edward Tufte to practically understand questions such as why you should prefer a bar chart over a line chart and why you typically should avoid pie charts whenever possible. Next, we will look at why Reporting Services is a rich  powerful platform for delivering your visualization before wrapping-up with techniques for implementing and delivering your eye-popping data visualizations.
