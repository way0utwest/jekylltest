## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
 
**Abstract**:
Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years, but are often thought of as old-fashioned. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against these standards and can be avoided by understanding the requirements, applying normalization, as well as a healthy dose of simple common sense. In this session I will give an overview of how to design a relational database, allowing you to work with the data structures instead of against them. This will let you use SQL naturally, enabling the query engine internals to optimize your output needs without you needing to spend a lot of time thinking about it. This will mean less time trying to figure out why SUBSTRING(column,3,1) = 'A' is killing your performance, and more time for solving the next customer problem.

## Title: Ensuring Analytics Hit the Mark  (and Get Used!)
 
**Abstract**:
Dashboards, Reports, Charts and all ways to structure data for analysis is failing! Sound familiar? If so, the adoption dilemma is present and needs to be solved.
If users would rather get data dumped to them, rather than work with what they’ve been given, this session is for you!
We’ll give you techniques to solve the adoption dilemma and make analytics the hero of your organization without having to endure the pain of further purchasing, added frustration or the ongoing angst for something your organization simply does not have.
This session will talk to the culture of analytics and the ways you might marry the best work of those who prepare the data (often IT) with the work those should be doing to explore the data (everyone else)!

## Title: Parameters in SQL Server - Query Performance Makers or Breakers
 
**Abstract**:
T-SQL programming makes wide use of parameterization in stored procedures, dynamic statements and ad-hoc queries. Many developers aren’t aware of the significant influence they have on query performance. Incorrect use or lack of parameters is a common reason for query performance issues.
Have you experienced a query that always ran fast, suddenly (and for "no reason") become slow? And with nothing changing? Yep!
* In this session we will learn about how the plan cache deals with queries that are (and are not) parameterized. 
* You'll learn about parameter sniffing, what it is, and how it's handled in the older and newest versions of SQL. 
* We will explore the problem of mismatched data types and implicit conversions - and how that ties in with ORM generated code. 
* Lastly, we'll take a peek at value list handling from applications, and how using a table valued parameter as an input instead.
If this is a new topic to you, you'll leave this session with takeaways galore.

## Title: Understanding and Implementing System-Versioned Temporal Tables
 
**Abstract**:
In many industries, it is necessary for data professionals to be able to show what a data set looked like at a previous point in time. Whether it's calculating tax or insurance rates based on a contract date, quickly comparing data changes over time for trend analysis or just recovering from an accidental data change, it's useful to be able to look back in time through our data. Starting in SQL Server 2016, system-versioned temporal tables provide a solution that tracks data through time with far less overhead than previously offered solutions. This session will cover the basics of temporal tables, how SQL Server manages data within those tables, and how to query data at a specific point in time using several real-world examples. We will also cover the mechanics of data retention and storage and archival of historical data. Attendees will leave with a fundamental understanding of practical use cases for temporal tables and the knowledge required to implement them successfully.

## Title: SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps is based on building an application binary (immutable artifact) that supports a highly reliable, repeatable engineering process.  In the case of SQL Server, however, a database is already in production, and isn’t simply replaced (as an app binary), but is upgraded.   Current SQL Server DevOps methods use source control to build a “development” database, with schema and objects and static data needed for functional testing.  "Near production data" is used in Staging, and finally production is upgraded.  This approach involves complexity, and breaks the principle of working with immutable artifacts throughout the process.  Our session introduces a new approach to SQL Server DevOps, with production databases used in all stages.   Production database clones are delivered more quickly than "built" databases, are more easily integrated with source control, and produces higher fidelity outcomes.  Learn how leading enterprises are simplifying SQL DevOps.

## Title: Azure Managed Instances—Your Bridge to the Cloud
 
**Abstract**:
Many organizations would like to take advantage of the benefits of using a platform as a service database like Azure SQL Database. Automated backups, patching, and costs are just some of the benefits. However, Azure SQL Database is not a 100% feature compatible with SQL Server—features like SQL Agent, CLR and Filestream are not supported. Migration to Azure SQL Database is also a challenge, as backup and restore and log shipping are not supported methods. 

Microsoft recently introduced Managed Instances—a new option that provides a bridge between on-premises or Azure VM implementations of SQL Server and Azure SQL Database. Managed Instances provide full SQL Server surface compatibility and support database sizes up to 35 TB.

In this session, you will learn about migrating your databases to Managed Instances, developing applications for managed instances. You will also learn about the underlying high availability and disaster recovery options for the solution.

## Title: Beginning Admin: The Care and Feeding of SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Design and development may be exciting, but database administration is absolutely critical (and, reasonably well-paying!) The care and feeding of a server tends to get short-changed or neglected.  In this class, we'll cover the basics of the big five administrator tasks:

* Backups – You must set up regular backups, to keep copies of your databases...just in case something breaks, or someone makes a bad, bad mistake.
* Integrity checks – Regularly and automatically check databases for corruption, which is when bits get scrambled, lost, and ruined.
* Index maintenance – Databases need regular upkeep so they'll continue to run well.
* Disk management – It's actually your job to find out about full disks before they happen. After all, databases grow!
* Alerting – Alerts tell you what's wrong, so you don't have to go looking for problems.

Being a database administrator is a big job, but we can cover the basics in one session!

## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from t
 
**Abstract**:
VMware Sponsor Session 
Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. “Virtualize First” is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too “critical” to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments.

## Title: Modern CPU Architecture and SQL Server Performance
 
**Abstract**:
Modern CPU architectures are complex and misunderstood, especially as they relate to SQL Server instance configuration and database usage patterns. Default values in virtualization and the SQL Server instance can cause misalignments and improper balance in the way the SQL Server lines up with the CPUs and memory, which results in an immediate (and silent) performance penalty. Come learn as we discuss topics such as physical and virtual NUMA, hyperthreading, query parallelism, and instance settings, and show you how to validate your SQL Server architecture and improve the performance of your critical SQL Servers.
