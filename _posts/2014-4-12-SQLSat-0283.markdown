##Title: PowerPivot, Tabular and Multidimensional Models: Understanding Analysis Services Flavors##
 
**Abstract**:
The Unified Dimensional Modeling (UDM) concept was introduced in Analysis Services 2005 as the semantic layer to enable the OLAP cube development from multiple sources using an abstract layer. Analysis Services 2012 introduces the Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) concept as an evolution to UDM, offering two new 'flavors': the Multidimensional Mode and the Tabular Mode. The BISM represents the heart of Microsoft Business Intelligence strategy for now and the upcoming years. This session will explain and clarify the basic concepts of Analysis Services 2012 and PowerPivot. We will also discuss different scenarios that will allow BI architects / developers take better decisions when building up the foundation for their companies’ Enterprise Analytics strategy.

##Title: Wish you could live the glamorous consulting life?##
 
**Abstract**:
Consulting is a great career choice, from the increased pay, (sometimes less), to the flexible hours, (working nights and weekends), you will work with a wide range of customers, (if you can find them), that will lead you to wonder why you didn't start earlier? (and walk away from a cushy job).

I would not trade my consulting career for any other choice, I love the rewards and the freedom it provides me, but I've learned the hard way.
In this session you will learn sales, marketing and management strategies to get your practice off the ground, sand traps to avoid along the way and a honest, down to earth assessment of the consulting life. An essential session for those thinking about this choice and/or those who are just starting out. Y

##Title: From Mess to Mastery: Managing Large Environments ##
 
**Abstract**:
In an era of "do more with less," IT staff are constantly being asked to manage environments without spending money. Worse yet, budgets are being cut for staff and tools. 

IT veteran Mike Hillwig will show you how some of the integrated tools within SQL Server can help you manage your environment without spending a ton of money. We'll look at the Central Management Server, Management Data Warehouse, Multi-Server Administration, and Policy Based Management. Mike will also show you his tips for building an Environment Inventory Database, a tool you can use to track your servers, instances, and login credentials. 

By leveraging what you already have in SQL Server, you'll certainly be able to do more with less.

##Title: Table Vars  Temp Tables - What you NEED to Know!##
 
**Abstract**:
Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"

##Title: Inside the Query Optimizer##
 
**Abstract**:
When it comes to SQL Server one of the biggest request you hear is “How can I make my Query Run FASTER!?”.  The answer understanding the first step in that process Is understanding the Query Optimizer.  Understanding the Optimizer beings with knowing the Rules.  The way our queries are written reflect directly on the output that we get. In this session we will look at the rules in SQL Server, write queries to show those rules in action, and walk out with a better understanding of how the Optimizer works.

##Title: Windowing Functions in SQL Server 2012##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2012 brings with it nearly full ANSI compliance with the windowing functions. Come to this code filled session to learn about all of the windowing functions in SQL Server 2012: Ranking functions, changes for windowing in the Aggregate functions, and the new Analytic and Sequence functions. We’ll examine how this latest implementation of the windowing functions allows us to perform running and sliding aggregations; retrieve data from adjacent rows in the partition, and much more – all without self-joins back to the source table.

##Title: Business Insight through Cloud Based Data Models##
 
**Abstract**:
It is common for power users and data scientists to start mocking up their analysis in Excel.

This session will explore promotion paths for PowerPivot models that mature to demand robust data transformations, as well as cleansing and master data procedures. You will learn the pros and cons of using cloud-based PowerPivot environments, as well as the recommended architectures for model growth.
