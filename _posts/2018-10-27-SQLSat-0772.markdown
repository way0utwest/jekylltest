## Title: Auf auf in die Cloud, ihr Datenbanken [DE]
 
**Abstract**:
Immer mehr Firmen möchten die Microsoft Public Cloud Azure nutzen, wissen aber nicht so recht wie man die Datenbanken dorthin bekommt.
Neben dem virtuellen Server gibt es auch die Azure SQL Databases, welche in zahlreichen Solution völlig ausreichend sind und sich flexibel an die Bedürfnisse anpassen lassen.
Dieser Vortrag zeigt die verschiedenen Möglichkeiten des Deployments ebenso der Migration und gibt Hinweise, worauf bei der Migration zu achten ist bzw welche Features eventuell (noch) fehlen.
Es wird eine Demo-reiche Session, aus der jeder etwas mitnehmen kann wie zum Beispiel Powershell-Ideen, Ansätze für Hochverfügbarkeit oder wie man Kosten reduzieren kann.

## Title: Data Overview and Manipulation – T-SQL, R, Python [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
In a real data mining or machine learning project, you spend more than half of the time on data preparation and data understanding. The R language is extremely powerful in this area. The Python language is a match. Of course, you do work with data by using T-SQL. You will learn in this session how to get data understanding with really quickly prepared basic graphs and descriptive statistics analysis. You can do advanced data preparation with many data manipulation methods available out of the box and in additional packages fro R and Python. After this session, you will understand what tasks the data preparation involves, and what tools you have in SQL Server suite for these tasks.

## Title: From SQL to R – Leverage Your T-SQL Knowledge to Learn R [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
You are already familiar with T-SQL and are eager to learn R but do not know where to start? Start from what you already know: T-SQL. Both languages have many things in common on some levels, but are very different on others. You will learn how to begin your first steps in the new language and how to perform the most common tasks, typical for R: statistics, machine learning  data visualization.
This session will kick you off to the new language by using analogies from T-SQL. You will learn how to write your first R-scripts, make usage of packages and will leave this session with a basic understanding of typical use-cases of R and how to integrate that into your existing environment with SQL Server.

## Title: Continuous Delivery for BI projects [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
If you are releasing new reports, SSAS cubes or SSIS packages on a regular basis, you've probably offered up your share of blood, toil, tears and sweat on getting them delivered into production in working condition.
Continuous Delivery is a way to bridge the gap between developers and IT professionals and for that we need to address the both the toolchain to support the practices as well as the mindset on the team. Microsoft offers a set of tools that'll help you on your journey towards the end goal: Maximize predictability, efficiency, security and maintainability of operational processes.

We will in detail be looking at:

Agile Development Frame of Mind
        The Path Ahead (direction)
	Visual Studio Online (tool)
	Feature/User Story/Work Item (concept)
Team Services
	Code Branching (concept)
	Build Agents (tool)
        Releases (tool)

## Title: The joy of analytics - Let's paint a Data Warehouse into the cloud [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
There are a lot of possibilities get insights out of your data, and since years we are doing this with "old-fashioned" techniques in our "classical" data warehouse environments. But the world is changing, and so its data.
Where the data years ago was always structured, the growth of different data types now seems to be infinite. We are struggling with saving data with changing schemas and getting insights of new data types like social media, video, and pictures.

In this whiteboard session, I would like to talk with you about modern ways to store, analyze and visualize data. We will draw a Modern Data Warehouse and have a look at the ways to get more insights out of your data and why the cloud could help us.

Come and join my session and draw a Modern Data Warehouse together.

## Title: Power BI deployment strategy for publishing and maintenance [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI: Minutes to create and seconds to impress. 

Yes, it takes minutes to create and share Power BI reports. Which means every user who has relevant Power BI access can create Workspaces, Apps, reports, dashboards and schedules. With no deployment strategy, maintaining Power BI service could become a terrible job. 
In this session, I will cover how having a having deployment strategy can make a terrible maintenance job seamless.

This session will include:
What happens when a user creates a Power BI app workspace
How to control user access
Working with different environments
Creating and sharing reports using Power BI Apps 
How to monitor dataset schedules and failure notifications
How to use Power BI API to document your organisation Power BI Service

## Title: Azure SQL Database Tips and Tricks for Beginners [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft released SQL Azure more than eight years ago - that's enough time for testing. So, are you ready to move your data to the Cloud? If you’re considering a business (aka production environment) in the Cloud, you need to think about methods for back up your data, a backup plan for your data and, eventually (sic!) restoring data. 

In this session, you’ll see the differences, functionalities, restrictions, and opportunities in SQL Azure DB and On-Premise SQL Server 2008/2008 R2/2012/2014/2016/2017. We will look for topics such as how to be prepared for backup and restore, and which parts of a cloud environment are most important: keys, triggers, indexes, prices, security, service level agreements, etc.

## Title: The Microsoft Power Platform - What is it? [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
May I introduce you to the Microsoft Power Platform!? 
This new term was introduced by Satya Nadella and James Philips as the serving foundation for building powerful (cloud-baked) applications. PowerApps as the data manipulation part, Microsoft Flow as the connecting workflow engine and Power BI for analysis and reporting. In addition, the Common Data Service (CDS) and the Common Data Model (CDM) provide a solid framework for data storage and modelling.
Join me in this session if you want to get an overview about the involved technologies, how they work together, see them live  working together in many demos and how they will definitely change the way of building powerful solutions in the future!

## Title: Embrace and Extend: First-Class Activity and 3rd Party Ecosystem for SSIS in ADF
 
**Abstract**:
This session focuses on the deeper integration of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) in Azure Data Factory (ADF) and the broad extensibility of Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime (IR). We will first show you how to provision Azure-SSIS IR – dedicated ADF servers for lifting  shifting SSIS packages – and extend it with custom/3rd party components. Preserving your skillsets, you can then use the familiar SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)/SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to design/deploy/configure/execute/monitor your SSIS packages in the cloud just like you do on premises. Next, we will guide you to trigger/schedule SSIS package executions as first-class activities in ADF pipelines and combine/chain them with other activities, allowing you to inject/splice built-in tasks/data transformations in your ETL/ELT workflows, automatically provision Azure-SSIS IR on demand/just in time, etc. And finally, you will learn about the licensing model for ISVs to develop paid components/extensions.

## Title: Connecting SQL and Blockchain: The Azure Blockchain Workbench [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
Getting a PoC for a Blockchain project running is hard enough. Connecting Blockchain data to classical databases, making them available to analytics or standard applications is worse (ever queried LevelDB?).
Microsofts  new "Azure Blockchain Workbench" let you do this in hours, not months. 
We will see how to
- Deploy a Blockchain on Azure in a breeze
- Generate templates for smart contracts
- Connect them to IoT devices
- Interact with the contracts via a simple UI
- Get all the data into a "real" database automatically

## Title: TensorFlow as a Service [DE]
 
**Abstract**:
Wer mit beliebten KI-Frameworks, wie beispielsweise TensorFlow, CNTK, Caffe, Chainer  Co, ein Modell bauen wollte, musste sich bislang selbst um die komplette Infrastruktur kümmern und seine Data Science IDE entsprechend konfigurieren.
Doch das hat jetzt ein Ende.
In dieser Session zeigt Sascha Dittmann wie man mit der Azure Machine Learning Workbench und dem Azure Batch AI Dienst eine durchgängige und einfach zu nutzende Data Science Umgebung aufbaut. Mit dieser lassen sich dann im großem Umfang parallel experimentieren, sowie Deep Learning- und KI-Modelle trainieren.

## Title: Becoming a hipster DBA, a guide to Github and CI/CD for Admins [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
The use of securing your code in source control and testing it automatically with a continuous integration tool is not something developers need to be convinced of. But DBAs have traditionally not used any of these techniques. It's also not that straight forward for them. Checking the outcome of a typical DBA script usually involves the need for infrastructure to be available in a certain state and tests that check the changes made to that infrastructure. This session will combine an introduction level talk about Git(hub) and Continuous Integration with the complexity of Infrastructure testing aimed ad DBAs.

## Title: Let’s build SSIS packages with Biml – live [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
You have heard about Biml? Maybe even seen a session about it before but still have doubts, how easy you can make something useful out of it? In this session, we’ll use Biml to build and populate a staging area including the corresponding SSIS packages. But there won’t be any pre-compiled demos! Everything is happening live! Starting with a blank staging database, we’re going to end up with a complete solution over the course of this session, to prove that it is not just easy to adapt existing Biml code but also to start from scratch and still be successful very quick!

Let’s see, how that goes…

## Title: PowerShell for the DBA: Why I love my inner pig-dog [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
DBAs and sysadmins never have time for the fun stuff. We are always restoring  a DB for a dev or setting up a new instance for that new BI project. What if I told you that you can make all that time consuming busy-work disappear?

In this session we will learn to embrace the power in PowerShell to allow us to sit back and relax..... or rather focus on the real work of designing better, faster systems instead of fighting for short time slots when we can do actual work.

Along the way we will see that we can benefit from the wide world of PowerShell expertise and avoid re-inventing the wheel, again!

## Title: The Query Store and Query Tuning in SQL Server [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
For the most part, query tuning in one version of SQL Server is pretty much like query tuning in the next. Azure SQL Database and SQL Server 2016 introduced the most important change to query tuning in ages, the Query Store. This session will explore how the Query Store works in Azure, SQL Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017. You will learn how Query Store changes the methods you use to troubleshoot and tune query performance. With the information in this session, not only will you understand how the Query Store works, but you’ll know everything you need in order to put it to work with your own SQL Server databases.
