##Title: Streamline development with VS build contributors##
 
**Abstract**:
While many teams are now using Visual Studio for database project development, few have begun to take advantage of build contributors.  Build contributors represent a powerful technology that is particularly adept at responding to changes in the database project.  This technology can enable integration scenarios which might otherwise be difficult or time-consuming, such as automatically updating documentation or installation scripts.  In this session, you will understand how build contributors are enabled, and see this technology in action.

##Title: Obliterate Excessive Blocking and Deadlocking##
 
**Abstract**:
Your databases are getting bigger and busier and you need to make the most out of the hardware you have. On your servers, excessive locking can often cause timeouts and database traffic jams! In this session I explore steps you can take to address unexpected locking issues. I also explain what steps to take to avoid contention in the future. Lots of examples taken from experience.

##Title: XML in SQL Server.  Why bother? ##
 
**Abstract**:
Many of the Developers and DBAs have the XML syndrome.  We can’t blame them because XML document are not simple.  But what most Developers and DBA don’t know is how SQL Server can help you overcome the XML syndrome.  XML is here to say, we will need to save some XML in the database more often than ever.  This session will cover usable scenarios when using Xpath, Xquery the XML type in SQL server and the XSD. We will look at the different tools available in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and Visual Studio (VS).  This is the chance to bring the DBA and Developer to the same level in using XML in SQL Server.

##Title: Build a Scale-Out Reporting Services 2008 R2 Farm##
 
**Abstract**:
Delivering reports is becoming more critical due to the increasing demand for business intelligence solutions. And while there are a lot of guides that walk us through building a highly available database engine, you’ll rarely see one for SQL Server Reporting Services. This session will walk you through building a scale-out SQL Server 2008 R2 Reporting Services farm from the ground up. You’ll be surprised how easy it is to do so that you can start building your own test environment.
