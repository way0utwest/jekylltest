## Title: Everything I Needed to Know About Dashboarding I Learned From World of Warcraft
 
**Abstract**:
The LSU Foundation embarked on its first $1B+ campaign in the university's history. To prepare, the organization saw the need to instill discipline, overhaul its systems, and develop a progressive business intelligence shop from the ground up. In this session you will hear from a world ranked World of Warcraft player on how her experience competing with one of the top guilds in the world provided deep insights that allowed her to build compelling, user friendly dashboards while instilling a culture that embraced transparency and accountability. This is a deep dive into the process that got them there, and the lessons they learned along the way. You will leave this session with concrete, actionable tasks and tools to begin building better dashboards, and a performance driven culture of your own.

## Title: Power BI Time Intelligence - Beyond the Basics
 
**Abstract**:
Time-Intelligence refers to doing BI calculations across periods of time (usually dates), and is the most common type of analysis in business reporting. Month-to-Date (MTD), Year-to-Date (YTD), Prior-Month (PM), Prior-Year (PY), Month-over-Month (MoM), Year-over-Year (YoY) are all examples of Time-Intelligence calculations. There are many approaches to implementing time-intelligence into your Power BI solutions, including the use of built-in date tables and time-intelligence functions. In this session, we'll explore several of these approaches and the associated tradeoffs. We'll also learn about the importance of a good date table, what attributes it should include, and how it can be leveraged to simplify more complex time-intelligence calculations. We'll also take the first step in mastering DAX by familiarizing ourselves with the CALCULATE function.

## Title: A Data Journey for an Analytics Company
 
**Abstract**:
Often the most challenging aspect of becoming a data-driven organization is determining where to start. Case in point: Icimo Analytics. As a company that transforms data into meaningful business value, we were neglecting our own data journey. Externally, we were transforming organizations into lean data machines while internally, we were still relying heavily on spreadsheets, multiple platforms and disparate systems. Turning our expertise inward, we designed dynamic dashboards fueled by Tableau and Alteryx to see a one-stop holistic view of our entire business. The end result? Each employee is strategically positioned to see, understand and make data-driven informed decisions driving value and setting the foundation for lasting growth and success.

I started my IT journey 20+ years ago with native programming in C, C++ and Visual Basic. I found myself gravitating towards back end and databases made me comfortable, knowing what's in store, data being captured. The information that data reveals, modeling data to suit consumption, slicing and dicing to reveal the state of a business and visualization to tell a story is very enjoyable for me.
As a consultant, I enjoy the vareity of business domains, business problems to solve and the challenge of devising a solution within constraints of client limitations or technology .

My first few jobs in IT were random IT consulting gigs but I really cut my teeth working in managed hosting with Digex in the late 90's.  I spent ten years supporting SharePoint at Microsoft but made the move to BI in 2015 and haven't looked back.  I work with Power BI and prefer to spend my time building and optimizing data models from piles of data.  When I am not wallowing in data, I spend time with my wife and two kids or pander to my mid life crisis by playing guitar.
