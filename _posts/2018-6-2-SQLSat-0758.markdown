## Title: Self-Service ETL with Power Query
 
**Abstract**:
Before any significant data analysis can take place the data often needs to be transformed, aggregated, and combined. This is often referred to as the ETL (Extraction, Transform, and Load) process. Power Query is an excellent tool in the Microsoft self-service BI stack that allows business users to discover, combine, and refine data before loading it into a Power Pivot model for further analysis. In addition Microsoft has made connecting to a wide variety of sources including relational, structured, and semi structured data a consistent intuitive experience. This session guides you through using Power Query to extract, transform, and load data from various sources into a Power Pivot model. In addition we will look at the M language created by the tool and look at some advanced queries you can create using M.

## Title: An introduction to Data Mining  with SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
With the vast amount of changes that occur in our daily business environments, it becomes more and more difficult to achieve our corporate goals without some ‘lighthouse’ to guide our way. Data mining, (while not a panacea to resolve or ‘control’ the effects of these changes), can provide us with statistical trends by analyzing our data and highlighting probable outcomes.

In this hands on BEGINNERS presentation we shall be looking at Microsoft SQL Server’s Data Mining capabilities and we shall be discussing:

1)  Defining what questions we want answered and how to go about this in an effective and efficient manner.

2)  Creating the data model.

3)  How to gather the necessary data, discussing the training and testing aspect.

4)  Processing the model.

5)  Extracting information from our finished model, discussing the implications of this information.

## Title: Query Optimization Techniques
 
**Abstract**:
How often have you been told that an application is running "too slow"?  This statement is the cause of a great deal of investigation, frustration, and dead-ends for database professionals.

The problem won't always be a bad query, but when it is, knowing how to dive in, diagnose its performance, and resolve the situation efficiently will turn a potentially frustrating situation into a fun one!  Using that knowledge in development to prevent future performance issues will improve script quality and application design, while making your future self less burdened by performance emergencies.

This is an opportunity to identify common query mistakes and learn a variety of ways in which we can solve them.  This discussion will include query rewrites, indexing, statistics, database design, monitoring, execution plans, and more!

Demos of poor-performing queries will be provided to illustrate key optimization techniques, design considerations, and the tools you need to fix them.  Fast.

## Title: SQL Server Reporting Services 2017 on Steroids!!
 
**Abstract**:
Reporting requests that are required ‘yesterday or sooner’, oft times necessitate working more efficiently and effectively. We have all been through this at one time or another.
In this hands on presentation we shall be looking some of the more challenging techniques of extracting our data from our Multidimensional and Tabular Models, in addition to our Data Mining Models. 
We shall be utilizing concepts of  ‘Openquery()’ and ‘linked servers’ as a means to extract data,  in addition to looking at the way that these two concepts can help us extract our data utilizing MDX, DMX and DAX expressions;  AND YET maintain the  flexibility and the ability to utilize all those wonderful techniques that may  be done with T-SQL.

## Title: Mapping SQL Server Expertise to Azure Cortana Intelligence - Cases and Scenarios
 
**Abstract**:
Platform as Service offerings now enables developers to roll out their database infrastructure in minutes with minimal management overhead. However, this same amount of flexibility also comes with the challenges of picking the right tool, on the right provider and with the proper expectations. All of these are new challenges that are coming into the field of responsibility of the SQL DBA professional.

In this session, we'll map Cloud offerings, mainly Azure, that corresponds to the current features SQL Server DBAs use, their use cases for each one based on our client projects, and how they are different to the different SQL Server features we are familiar with. The goal is to get SQL Server DBAs on the latest Azure offerings and the echo of Cortana Intelligence.  If time allows, we will also show some offerings from Google Cloud.

## Title: J'ai migré un publisher sans réinitialiser la réplication
 
**Abstract**:
Récemment, suite à une panne matérielle, j'ai du migrer les bases d'un publisher et la distribution sur un autre serveur. Puisque ces bases sont très volumineuses et que je n'avais pas à ma disposition de failover cluster sur le distributeur, je ne souhaitais pas devoir réinitialiser la réplication transactionnelle pour éviter les interruptions de service.
Dans cette session, je vais expliquer comment j'ai réalisé cette migration. Si vous ne connaissez pas la réplication, cette session vous permettra de comprendre comment elle fonctionne et les différents agents. Si vous maîtrisez la réplication, vous découvrirez peut être une nouvelle méthode de migration.

## Title: Screw DevOps, Let's Talk DataOps
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps is the new hot topic for IT, but only answers part of the problem. This session and demo will discuss why data creates continual friction in the DevOps environment and how it must be incorporated into the solution.
Reasons for this solution is required: -Data is getting bigger and more complex -Security concerns around critical data is becoming more evident every day -Data is created in silos in many sources, yet consumed in just as many locations, including on-premises and in the cloud.

We'll discuss the tech, the politics and the challenges of bringing data into DevOps and how to do so more successfully with culture changes, tools, scripting, and virtualization.

Takeaways from this session:
1. Learn the five principles of Data Ops 2. How embracing a dynamic data platform can eliminate challenges and provide automation. 3. Learn the difference between containers, packages and data pods. 4. Learn how to bridge the gap between data and people, eliminating culture from the scene

## Title: Les bases du dépannage SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server, base de données la plus vendue en nombre de licences, reste relativement facile à administrer, tout en offrant un niveau de performance de premier ordre et une fiabilité excellente. Combien de "pannes" avec vous eu lors des 5 ou 10 dernière années ? Attention, ne me faites pas dire que l'on peut se passer des systèmes de haute disponibilité, FCI ou groupes de disponibilité. Il suffit de déterminer le RPO et le RTO et de monnayer l'indisponibilité du serveur pour déterminer si une stratégie de disaster recovery suffit, ou bien s'il faut prévoir la mise en haute disponibilité des ressources SQL.
Au final, le logiciel est fiable et ne provoque que très rarement des erreurs, des "plantages". 
Par contre, au quotidien, cela ne veut pas dire qu'il ne va pas y avoir de problèmes sur l'instance, principalement de connexion, d'autorisation ou de performance.
Au cours de cette session, nous allons aborder les bases du diagnostic et du dépannage SQL Server.

## Title: Accelerating Development and Testing Using Data Virtualization
 
**Abstract**:
Constraining everything in development and testing is database size. Storage is a bottleneck, and while faster SSD/Flash is available, it is often too expensive due to the size of many databases, especially if not production. More importantly, it takes a lot of time to push terabytes around, and time itself is expensive. The old joke about "good, fast, and cheap -- pick any two" is very true with data.

Because providing full databases for each developer on each project seems unrealistic, when each copy might require terabytes of storage, for decades everyone has limited themselves to working in shared non-production environments that are refreshed only every few months at best. Conflicts occur,  quality suffers, and things move slowly.

Come learn why data virtualization is the solution to a problem everyone knows.

Good, fast, and cheap -- have all three with data virtualization.  Clone things easily and quickly, and remove the biggest constraint to development and testing.

## Title: Azure Cosmos DB + Gremlin API in Action
 
**Abstract**:
Graph databases have been around in various
forms for a long time, in a wide range of data analysis from science technology
to business scenarios. However, there may still be a small pool of T-SQL
experts with graph experience, especially dealing with Gremlin traversal query language.
That's fully understandable. The session is not aimed on encouraging users to stop
using T-SQL, but rather giving them a new performing blade on their data analysis Swiss knife so to
speak. This session will start with a quick overview of new Azure Cosmos DB - Graph API options
It will then expose main comparaison between T-SQL vs Gremlin, and reasons why
graph may be more beneficial.
It will then give a basic introduction of Gremlin Transversal topology in real context.
Finally a demo will cover how to create a new Azure Cosmos DB - Graph API project
from Visual Studio Code. 
1.Generating Vertex and Edges through Core 2.0 Console Application +  
2.Consuming Graph API data query in Core .2.0 Web client.

## Title: My Power BI report is slow: what should I do?
 
**Abstract**:
Abstract	You created a wonderful Power BI report, but when you open it you wait too much time. Changing a slicer selection is also slow. Where should you start analyzing the problem? What can you do to optimize performance?
This session will guide you in analyzing the possible reasons for a slow Power BI report. By using Task Manager and DAX Studio, you will be able to determine whether you should change the report layout, or if there is something in DAX formulas or in the data model that is responsible for the slow response.
At the end of this session, you will understand how to locate a performance bottleneck in a Power BI report, so you will focus your attention on the biggest issue.
