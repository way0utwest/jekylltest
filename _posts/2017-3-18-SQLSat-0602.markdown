##Title: Advanced insides into System Versioned Temporal Tables##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2016 introduces support for system-versioned temporal tables as a database feature that brings built-in support for providing information about data stored in the table at any point in time rather than only the data that is correct at the current moment in time. 

This session takes you behind the basics of Temporal Tables and answers - after a short introduction - the following questions:
- How to handle the change of NULL constraints?
- Can Temporal Tables be renamed and what happens to the System Versioned table?
- What will happen if you change meta data (data length, data type, ...)?
- What happens if you drop a column or add another column to the Temporal Table?
- what about security for the  system versioned table?
- what about calculated columns in the temporal table?
- ...

You are interested in the answers to all the above questions (and more). This session will answer EVERY question about Temporal Tables.

##Title: Mastering DML Operations like a master##
 
**Abstract**:
DML operations mean lot of work for the database engine of Microsoft SQL Server. Understanding the details of a DML transaction may give you great benefits when planning workloads for INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE operations.

Come and learn the differences of space allocation/deallocation between Clustered Indexes and Heaps in this demo oriented session. It will answer these questions:

What is the difference of data page allocation for heaps and clustered indexes?
What is the amount of transaction log when you update data in a heap and/or in a clustered index?
What are the differences when data are delete from a heap and clustered index?
Can ETL processes be improved by usage of the right strategy for INSERTS and DELETES?
What performance drawbacks have Page Splits and Forwarded Records for my application design?

##Title: The Next Frontier-  Opportunities When Migrating to the Cloud with Virtualization##
 
**Abstract**:
Cloud is everywhere and the database administrator is caught in the middle. How do you know where to start and what to migrate first? How do you perform consolidation planning and ensure data security? This session builds on a full demonstration, along with tips and tricks to show how the DBA can secure their environment to allow a self-service option so they no longer are the constraints to projects! The attendee will leave with a clear understanding of:
* Principles of virtualization and why it’s the answer to so many challenges we face today.
* How easy it is to secure data in the cloud using data masking features.
* The ease of connecting to the cloud and migrating environments.
* How to troubleshoot when issues arise and the tools available to diagnose issues.

##Title: NSA Secrets - Hacking SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
How easy is it to hack a SQL Server? 
In this session we'll see a few examples on how to exploit SQL Server, modify data and take control, while at the same time not leaving a trace.
We'll start by gaining access to a SQL Server (using some "creative" ways of making man-in-the-middle attacks), escalating privileges and tampering with data at the TDS protocol level (e.g. changing your income level and reverting without a trace after payment), and more. 
Most importantly, we'll also cover recommendations on how to avoid these attacks, and take a look at the pros and cons of new security features in SQL Server 2016.
This is a demo-driven session, suited for DBAs, developers and security consultants (Jedi level). 
Disclaimer: No actual state secrets will be revealed. Please do not send agents to my house again.

##Title: Getting release management right for SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
You are ahead of the curve. You’ve learned that you need to put your database in source control and you’ve set up some sort of automated build and regression testing process. (Or you’ve been to my continuous integration session.)

However, your deployments are still expensive and risky. You find it hard to keep track of what has been deployed to each environment. You don’t have a great deal of confidence that the production database is still in line with source control. You may have heard of the automated deployment functionality in VSTS or Octopus Deploy but you haven’t tried it yet… at least not for SQL Server.

In this session I’ll automate a deployment pipeline in a couple of different ways. I’ll discuss the importance of your database model as well as repeatable upgrade scripts and discuss the pros and cons of different approaches to automation. I’ll also discuss how to monitor for and protect yourself from database drift.

##Title: Scripting tabular models##
 
**Abstract**:
Introducing the new scripting language for tabular models. Before SQL Server 2016 tabular models was wrapped into a multidimensional constructs. TMSL is the new native language for tabular which is build on JSON - this makes it easy to understand, modify and deploy.

During this session I will go through and explain some examples on generating a SSAS tabular model by using the new TSML. I will spend some time showing and about explaining a real world example on pushing measure creation to the key business stakeholders to ensure quick time to market.

The last thing i will show is how you speed up your development free up up to 50% of the time you spend building tabular models with the simple an advanced features of Tabular Editor 2.0

##Title: Azure ML vs Cognitive Services Recommendations##
 
**Abstract**:
Anyone who has already gained experience with Azure ML knows how hard it is to find a suitable algorithm that fits the task.
Cognitive services are becoming increasingly powerful and easy to address. With the focus on suggestions (Customers who bought this product also bought ...) I compare Azure ML and Cognitive Servies Recommendations. The result is the same for both, a proposal which could also be interesting. Only the how is for the developer significantly different.

##Title: Bioinformatics on Azure##
 
**Abstract**:
If people think about big data, they always think about Twitter or Facebook. But there are other areas where much more data amounts incurred and the analyzes are more complex. In this talk, we talk about a real example from bioinformatics. We will explain the actual scenario and how the various Microsoft platforms from SQL Server to Azure Data Lake and Power BI could help us – or not.

##Title: Elegant T-SQL Solutions for Real World Problems##
 
**Abstract**:
T-SQL can help solve many problems you are faced with at your job.
Each problem can have many solutions, but not every solution is simple to write, understand and maintain, and not every solution is good in terms of performance.
In this session, we will look at real world problems and solve them using T-SQL. We won’t settle for just A solution, but show elegant, simple solutions that will yield optimal performance.
