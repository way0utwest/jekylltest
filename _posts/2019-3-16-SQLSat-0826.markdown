##Title: Basics of Database Corruption Repair##
 
**Abstract**:
Your database is running fine month after month with no problems. Suddenly someone reports that their query won’t run. They get an error stating “SQL Server detected a logical consistency-based I/O error“, or something even scarier. Do you know what to do now? We will walk through 3 corrupt databases exploring ways to go about finding and fixing the corruption. More importantly we will explore how to prevent further data loss at the time corruption occurs. Learn what things you can do to protect yourself when corruption strikes. Learn how to avoid making things worse, and how to protect your data if things do get worse. You will leave with a checklist of steps to use when you encounter corruption. By the end of this session you will be ready to take on corruption, one database at a time.

##Title: Data Quality matters! Go for a quality roundtrip in the MS data platform (2019 Version)##
 
**Abstract**:
In the times of data explosion, a dazzling array of information streams and unbelievable possibilities of different techniques to manage data via the Microsoft Data Platform, this session asks the question: what about data curation? 
We dive into the requirements of modern curation and show in examples, what the Microsoft Data Platform has to offer: Can SQL Server Master Data Service (MDS), Data Quality Services (DQS) and Integration Service (SSIS) especially with the integration in ADF help? Which options offers the Azure Data Catalog and how does the Microsoft Dataflows come into play? We also look at the potential of the new integrated languages in the Data Platform like R or Python via Azure Databricks. At the end of this session you will have an overview and understanding of the possibilities, that Microsoft Data Platform offers you to address your data curation requirements.

##Title: Introduction to Power BI dataflows##
 
**Abstract**:
This fall Microsoft introduced Power BI dataflows, a powerful new feature for self-service data preparation powered by Azure Data Lake Storage gen2. Dataflows bring the familiar Power Query data prep experience to the Power BI service, and enable analysts and business users to define reusable data entities that can be shared and reused across workspaces and apps.

In this session, Power BI program manager Matthew Roche will introduce this exciting new capability, including an end-to-end demonstration of the Power BI dataflows experience. If you haven’t yet started to explore dataflows – or if you want to build on what you already know – this is the session for you.

##Title: Introduction to Azure AI - The Art of the possible##
 
**Abstract**:
According to the Economist magazine, data is the world’s most valuable resource.  So, it makes sense that Data Science, Azure Machine Learning, and Analytics are all becoming core pieces to the success of every business.  As data professionals, we need to know how these core pieces will affect what we do, and how we can use the Azure AI suite to help our clients.  Microsoft’s AI suite is the central hub for learning and implementing each of these core pieces.  Using an easy to follow example, I will show the flow from problem to solution.  Multiple demonstrations of the different pieces will show use cases of the AI suite.  This overview of Azure AI will use the various pieces like a puzzle which, when brought together, will form a seamless picture of the whole so that participants can see that the individual pieces were meant to work together.

##Title: Predictive Analytics with R in Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI reports are typically used for descriptive analysis: a historical look of what has happened. But what if your report could visualize what is likely to happen and recommend what you can do about it now? This session will cover how to shift from descriptive to predictive analysis and leverage the power of machine learning to enhance your business intelligence solutions. The basics and best practices of predictive modeling will be introduced, and these concepts will be applied to create three predictive models in R using three different techniques. We will then walk through the three different ways to integrate the predictive power of these models into a Power BI report.

##Title: DBA Checklists: Reliable, Repeatable,  Automated.##
 
**Abstract**:
Now that SQL Server loves PowerShell and Microsoft loves open source, it is even easier to automate even your most time-consuming, repetitive, mundane or burdensome tasks.

Using the DbaChecks PowerShell module released at the SQLBits 2018 conference we can:
    Track SQL Server instance configurations
    Promptly provide required information to managmement, change configuration or developers
    Deftly respond to audit change requirements across your entire estate (and impress your auditor with PowerShell;)
    Restore SQL Servers to their correct state prior and post deployment
    Test *everything* from configuration to permissions, SQL service account share access to sysadmins, Agent Jobs to SPNs
 
This session will look at how to install and use this module . With multiple examples we will look at both running the checks and viewing the data in the supplied PowerBI reports.

Pre-requisites
Some basic knowledge of PowerShell and DBA

##Title: SQL Server Encryption##
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever wanted to know how Transparent Database Encryption (TDE) works or how you set it up? What about encrypting your backups? This session will go over all the steps and caveats that go with this technology. TDE allows you to have your database encrypted on disk and the same Encryption Hierarchy allows you to back up your database and have it encrypt the contents in the backup file.  We will discuss the Encryption Hierarchy which is used for encryption in SQL Server and take you through keeping your secrets safe. We will also go over how Always Encrypted works as well. Master the concepts of SQL Server Encryption when you are done with this session.

##Title: Taking back control of your work using Kanban##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you and your team feel overwhelmed by the amount of outstanding work? Are your clients constantly complaining because work is not being delivered?  Do you think that despite throwing time and resources at every project very little seem to get done? Kanban may be for you.

Kanban is a method of managing work with a focus on continuous delivery, this means that there is a steady stream of completed work going out the door and resulting in more efficient use of developer time but more importantly happier clients.

You will be introduced to the concepts behind Kanban, finding that it is one of the most natural work methodologies to setup and scales well from one person teams through to large enterprises. While there are many tools, many of them free, you can still get going with nothing more than a few sticky notes and a whiteboard.

##Title: SQL Server on Linux and Containers changes everything for the better!!##
 
**Abstract**:
When Microsoft released SQL Server 2017 it allowed us to run SQL Server on Linux and native Linux containers. This radical change provides a wider and open platform that data professionals can choose how to deploy and run SQL Server.

This session will demonstrate what on SQL Server for Linux is familiar for the data professional and will also highlight some of the differences. We will look at how containers are a game changer for deploying and managing of SQL Server.

The session will also introduce how the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a scalable and highly available platform for SQL Server within containers.

DEMOs in this session will show how easy it is to install SQL Server on both Linux and containers and how Infrastructure as Code provides a mechanism to automate the installation of SQL Server, deploy databases and perform integration tests.

This session will show you the exciting future of SQL Server and how you can learn about it today.

##Title: Continuous Integration for Analysis Services?##
 
**Abstract**:
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are well used methods in modern software engineering approaches and can help reduce workload, risks and therefore costs significantly. But Business Intelligence projects and amongst those especially Analysis Services projects offer certain challenges to the appliance of those methods. Comprehensive support by software vendors is definitely not given. So if you want to integrate those methods into your application life-cycle management (ALM) you probably will need to build your own solution. We will shortly recap definition and advantages of CI and CD. After a short analysis of the special challenges for BI projects we will dive into possible approaches. And let's try to find out if cloud services can be of significant importance.

##Title: Analyze and solve common wait stats scenarios##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a high frequently used piece of software which need to serve single requests and/or hundreds of thousands of requests in a minute. Within these different kinds of workloads Microsoft SQL Server has to handle the concurrency of tasks in a fashion manner. This demo driven session shows different scenarios where Microsoft SQL Server has to wait and manage hundreds of tasks. See, analyze and solve different wait stats due to their performance impact:
- CXPACKET: when a query goes parallel
- ASYNC_IO_COMPLETION: speed up IO operations (Growth / Backup / Restore)
- ASYNC_NETWORK_IO: What happens if your application refuses data?
- THREADPOOL starvation: crush of requests for Microsoft SQL Server
- PAGELATCH_xx: How does Microsoft SQL Server protects data?

##Title: Azure Machine Learning 101##
 
**Abstract**:
There are several ways to create a machine learning model. You can use R or Python or even other languages such as C#. Advanced coding skills are required no matter which language you choose. Once the solution is created, it’s often difficult to deploy. 

Microsoft addresses those problems with Azure Machine Learning, or Azure ML. Azure ML has built-in transforms for cleansing and munging data. It also contains a variety of configurable machine learning models that can be used without coding. Deploying the model is easy, and users can link to it directly with Excel or a custom application can be written.

If you are experienced in machine learning but haven’t seen Azure ML or if you are curious about machine learning and data science, this session is for you.

##Title: Tips, Tricks and Secrets for the SQL Professional##
 
**Abstract**:
Ever heard the term, "work smarter, not harder". A mantra to live by in my book. Over the years, I have seen, forgotten, seen again and forgotten again all of the shortcuts, tips and tricks we all take for granted. SO like a good DBA, I started to document and share all of these commands and shortcuts to share. Come see and learn many of the everyday shortcuts in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) that will help make your life easier on a daily basis.

##Title: The Science of Success: Building Faith in a Data Warehouse##
 
**Abstract**:
For data professionals, understanding why a data warehouse doesn't get adopted immediately and broadly in an organization can be difficult.  Data in your warehouse is arguably of better quality and in a more usable form than what's in the systems you source your data from… so where does this reluctance come from, and how do you overcome it?
Despite our broad expertise of data tools, the robotic consistency of the computational resources they leverage, and the immutable GIGO law - presenting a reasoned and thorough validation process often isn't enough.  Trust isn't given instantly, it has to be earned - by involving SMEs, letting them make the rules, and proving daily consistency.
Learn how to leverage your tooling expertise in SSIS and SQL to build a dead-simple framework to build faith in data.  Leverage analyst and business user questions and angst into repeatable, consistent proof of correctness - that's part of the science of success for a data warehouse.

##Title: SQL Server on Amazon Web Services - Elastic Compute Cloud vs Relational Database Service?##
 
**Abstract**:
Amazon web services offers a befuddling number of of different services. Among these are the two major options for running SQL Server on AWS - Elastic Compute Cloud and Relational Database Services. Why would one be picked over the other? What are the limitations and trade offs? We will discuss these questions among others while working through the process of restoring a sample database under both services.

He currently lives in Washington state and works as an independent consultant providing remote performance DBA and performance tuning services for clients in the USA and Canada. His first exposure to SQL Server was as a database developer, but over time he became more and more interested in how the database engine operated... eventually specializing more on performance issues than code.

Rick will work with all things relational, but most enjoys helping smaller companies get better performance from MSSQL, as well as smoothing over relationships between DBA and development teams.

##Title: Using Your On-prem Data in a Cloud World##
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft Power BI, Flow, and PowerApps are powerful cloud tools that can take your on-premises data to new heights. Using your data where it is now gives you the ability to invest in improving processes, instead of focusing on a data migration strategy.

In this session, we will discover the benefits of using the cloud tools, how those benefits translate to being on-prem, and how we can use the data in Office 365 as well. We will setup a data gateway, connect to on-prem data sources, and use that data in Office 365 and SharePoint Server 2019.

##Title: Managing and monitoring SQL Server on Linux from the command line##
 
**Abstract**:
When SQL Server arrived on Linux in 2017, Microsoft brought with it a database engine that works exactly the same as it does on Windows.

While you can manage and monitor SQL Server on Linux using existing tools designed for Windows, there are command line tools that will feel right at home to seasoned command-line and scripting veterans, including Oracle DBAs.

This session will cover mssql-conf (for configuring the server instance), mssql-cli (for connecting to the database engine), and dbfs (mounting a virtual file system) to query database management views (DMVs) using bash.

**Abstract**:
As an Excel user, you've probably been building Pivot Tables for years… but do you know the difference between a Fact and a Dimension? The reality is that PivotTables have done a great job of protecting us from needing to understand proper data modeling, but in modern Excel and Power BI that has changed.
In this session we will look at understanding the benefits of dimensional modeling in Power Pivot. We will define and review key terms and best practices, and show you how to use Power Query to reshape, split and combine tables into their proper tabular formats for a model.

##Title: Effective Indexing##
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wondered what makes an index useful? Curious about why the optimizer picks the indexes that it does? Wondered what black magic goes into designing good indexes?

In this session, we'll look at design considerations for rowstore non-clustered indexes. We'll investigate what makes an index useful to SQL Server and what common mistakes make indexes useless. We'll go into the details of how various query predicates interact with indexes and what the primary driver is when designing indexes for any database application.

This session is aimed at people who are relatively new to SQL Server indexing.

##Title: Use Docker to Deploy SQL Server Applications##
 
**Abstract**:
Docker can not only be used for testing purposes, but also for deploying applications. The big advantage for the customer of the application is that nothing has to be installed, there are no obstacles to the application running in the given environment etc. because the environment is defined by the developer. German Data Platform MVP Frank Geisler will show how all of this can be achieved by using docker. There will be plenty of demos in which all the necessary steps will be shown.

##Title: Can Scott create a mobile app in an hour using PowerApps?##
 
**Abstract**:
Scott isn't a rocket scientist… far from it… he will shy away from .NET development ANY chance he can get!  PowerApps, part of Microsoft's Power Platform, allow the knowledgeable information worker to develop in a "Low Code/No Code" environment.  Sure, there are expressions to control logic in PowerApps, but if you can handle writing excel formulas, I'm sure you'll be just fine.  Watch Scott sweat on stage as he builds a responsive application in the cloud and push it down to his iPhone, store and retrieve data from an enterprise data solution, and take a bow… (or scrunch up into a fetal position and never step on stage again… )
