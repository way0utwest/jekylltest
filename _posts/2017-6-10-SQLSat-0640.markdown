## Title: Mastering Master Data Services
 
**Abstract**:
As your organization grows, one challenge will be the management of data between systems and organizational units. With MDS, Microsoft provides the ability to have one accurate source of non-transactional data. This data can then be used within applications, other databases, and ETL processes. By leveraging data stewards to help manage the data repository, you can ensure that your MDS data is always up-to-date and accurate.

In this presentation we will cover MDS from start to finish including installation, creating models/entities, working with data, using the Excel add-in, security, hierarchies, views, versions, and business rules. After this presentation, you will have a good understanding of what master data management is, what MDS does, how to use it, and how to get started with your own MDS project.

## Title: Query Processing in In-Memory OLTP (Hekaton)
 
**Abstract**:
In-Memory OLTP (code name: Hekaton) is the most important new feature in SQL Server 2014, and this session will teach you how query processing and optimization work with this new database engine. After explaining the basics, we will discuss how the query optimizer is used in In-Memory OLTP by both natively compiled stored procedures and by traditional stored procedures accessing memory-optimized tables through the query interop functionality. We will also take a look at how the new hash and range indexes are used, as well as how their performance implications are also covered along with the process of translating the plan created by the query optimizer into C code. Finally, some limitations with the current release will also be explained.

## Title: Architecting virtual SQL server for performance
 
**Abstract**:
Today, many organizations have already virtualized most of their non critical applications, these organizations are now employing a "Virtual First" policy, harnessing the efficiency and cost savings of virtualization for their most critical applications. 
Still, many IT architects and DBA's are hesitant of virtualizing their SQL workloads, they are worried about  performance, scale, availability and support for what is usually considered their most critical applications.  In this session we will review the guidance for successfully virtualizing critical SQL databases, we will cover the best practices, real world customer experience  and what to watch out for when virtualizing the most critical SQL databases. The session is delivered by the author of the official SQL server on VMware best practices guide.

## Title: Upgrades  Rollbacks for SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Are you facing a big SQL Server upgrade but are not quite sure how you will tackle it?  In this presentation we will discuss what we learned during our 2008 R2 upgrade to SQL 2014.  We will go through how we met our RTO, RCO, rollback, testing, and actual cutover process. 

We will utilize setting up and testing mirroring to move the data from 2008 to 2014. We will migrate the IP of the old 2008 cluster to the new 2014 cluster.  This way no clients change their connection strings as DNS is not an option in this environment.  Trans Replication will be set for rollback to the 2008 cluster in case we need to after going live.  We will use the 'no init' option as we do not have time to create a snapshot and will protect the data during the upgrade to ensure no writes are conducted.

Scripts and a background on transaction replication will be provided to show the end user how to start testing this process in their environment.  Pre-cutover and Post-cutover tasks will also be discussed.

## Title: What, When and Why, a particular database technology (relational or non-relational) to use
 
**Abstract**:
With availability of many choices for database technologies, developer/architect tend to make wrong selection of database systems that helps solving problem for short term but does become problem in long term. Most of these problems are result of not knowing What, When and Why to use a particular database systems but starts using it because they know, how to use it or it looks fascinating or others are using it. Session is planned to uncover myth that leads to common mistake in database system selection, guide thru focus area and provide guidance, and provide use case scenario for both relational and non-relational database systems.

## Title: SQL Server AGs and Clustering In The Cloud
 
**Abstract**:
This session is to help you see how straight forward it is to create a test environment in AWS and Azure utilizing the features provided by Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC).  We will create both an instance level Failover Cluster Instance (FCI) and a 2014 Availability Group (AG) with a read-only replica node.   We will show how to setup IPs, iSCSI devices, default AD setup, and SQL Server installations.  Some basic Powershell will be used and the code made available if needed.

iSCSI will be created using a 'Storage Gateway' on AWS and another solution such as DataKeeper for Microsoft Azure.

Ultimately these environments will allow you to quickly spin up machines and begin to look at State Configuration solutions such as 'Microsoft DSC' or for example, utilizing the SALT stack.

## Title: Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.

## Title: Amazon Aurora - A New Dawn in the World of Relational Database Engines
 
**Abstract**:
Amazon Aurora is the result of being asked this question by Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO  the person responsible for the conception of AWS: "In a world where AWS exists, how would you re-design the relational database?"  What the data team came up with is a whole new paradigm shift: they built a service-oriented  decoupled architecture applied to a database engine.

Aurora has 5x the throughput comparable to enterprise commercial databases at 1/10th the cost. It’s built on AWS for the cloud, it's self-managing  self-healing. You can perform 6M inserts  30M selects per minute, scaling out further via Read Replicas. Storage automatically grows storage up to 64 TB, and more.
