##Title: SQL Server Containers and Clones##
 
**Abstract**:
“Containers and Clones for SQL Server Development and Test”
 
Microsoft is emphasizing the use of containers for development and test on SQL Server 2017, and new solutions from Red Gate and Windocks add support for containers and SQL Server database database cloning,  for the full range of the SQL Server family.   We’ll explore use of Docker based tooling for delivery of container environments, and their pros and cons.     We’ll also look at SQL Server cloning, and how clones enable Dev and Test teams to work on large database environments for containers as well as existing SQL Server instances.

Containers and Clones are particularly well suited for Public and Hybrid Cloud, as it’s infrastructure agnostic.   Container images are ultimately portable, and the built-in database cloning is especially useful on public clouds.

##Title: Make Power BI Your Own with the Power BI APIs##
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI makes accessing data from various sources (both on-premise and in the cloud) and building advanced visualizations for analytics easy to do. Behind the scenes Power BI is built on standard technologies and APIs that allow it to be customized in multiple ways to fit in with your environment the way you need it to. In this session we will walk though samples and demos that show how you can extend Power BI with custom visualizations, access custom data sources, embed various Power BI elements in your applications (on-premise and in the cloud), and be able to push your data into a Power BI report/dashboard. Each of these items take advantage of the Power BI APIs in different ways and we will discuss each and provide the code samples for you to take back and get a head start. This session will be showing code to access the Power BI REST API using C# and NodeJS along with some M for accessing and manipulating custom data sources (on-premises or in the cloud).

##Title: Introduction to Cortana  – Turning Data into Intelligent Action##
 
**Abstract**:
According to the Economist magazine, data is the world’s most valuable resource.  So, it makes sense that Data Science, Azure Machine Learning, and Analytics are all becoming core pieces to the success of every business.  As data professionals, we need to know how these core pieces will affect what we do, and how we can use this suite to help our clients.  Microsoft’s Cortana suite is the central hub for learning and implementing each of these core pieces.  Using an easy to follow example, I will show the flow from Data to Data Intelligence. The demonstration uses several pieces of the Cortana Suite and brings them together to show how they complement each other.  This overview of Cortana Suite will use the various pieces like a puzzle which, when brought together, will form a seamless picture of the whole so that participants can see that the individual pieces were meant to work together.

##Title: On Transactions and Atomic Operations##
 
**Abstract**:
"If there’s one thing that we, as SQL developers don’t do, it’s use transactions as often as we should.

Transactions are critical when multiple changes need to be made entirely or not at all, but even given that it’s rare to see transactions used at all in most production code

In this session, we’ll look at what transactions are and why we should use them. We’ll explore the effects transactions have on locking and the transaction log. We’ll investigate methods of handling errors and undoing data modifications, and we’ll see why nested transactions are a lie.

1) Understand what transactions are and what they do.

2) Learn how to use transactions in combination with error handling to roll back changes on errors

3) Learn how transactions affect logging and locking.

"

##Title: Welcome To the 2016 Query Store!##
 
**Abstract**:
One of my favorite new features in SQL Server 2016 is the Query Store. The Query Store houses valuable information on performance of your queries as well as gives you great insights into your query workload. This presentation will take a look at the Query Store, how it works and the type of information it holds. You will learn how to use the Query Store to quickly find plan changes and analyze performance issues caused by them.  New DMVs will be introduced and the performance impact of enabling the Query Store will be discussed. Both DBAs and developers can increase their performance tuning skills by attending this session.

##Title: Self-Service ETL with Power Query##
 
**Abstract**:
Before any significant data analysis can take place the data often needs to be transformed, aggregated, and combined. This is often referred to as the ETL (Extraction, Transfer, and Load) process. Power Query is an excellent tool in the Microsoft self-service BI stack that allows business users to discover, combine, and refine data before loading it into a Power Pivot model for further analysis. In addition Microsoft has made connecting to a wide variety of sources including relational, structured, and semi structured data a consistent intuitive experience. This session guides you through using Power Query to extract, transform, and load data from various sources into a Power Pivot model. In addition we will look at the M language created by the tool and look at some advanced queries you can create using M.

##Title: Locks, Blocks, and Snapshots: Maximizing Database Concurrency##
 
**Abstract**:
The ability for multiple processes to query and update a database concurrently has long-been a hallmark of database technology, but this feature can be implemented in many ways. This session will explore the different isolation levels supported by SQL Server and Azure SQL Database, why they exist, how they work, how they differ, and how In-Memory OLTP fits in. Demonstrations will also show how different isolation levels can determine not only the performance, but also the result set returned by a query. Additionally, attendees will learn how to choose the optimal isolation level for a given workload, and see how easy it can be to improve performance by adjusting isolation settings. An understanding of SQL Server's isolation levels can help relieve bottlenecks that no amount of query tuning or indexing can address - attend this session and gain Senior DBA-level skills on how to maximize your database's ability to process transactions concurrently.

##Title: TempDB: The forgotten pillar of performance tuning##
 
**Abstract**:
TempDB is an integral part of SQL Server, and is often overlooked when trying to get the most out of your system. Researching the many suggested methods of tuning TempDB is a long, arduous and at times confusing process.

In this session we will go over what TempDB is used for, why it is a special and important type of database and how to tune it to enhance the performance of your overall system. 

We will start with determining the best configuration of TempDB database files to use, the impact disk configuration has, which trace flags are important and what changes SQL Server 2016 will bring us. We will look at what is stored in TempDB and how both developers and DBA can optimize how TempDB is configured and used.

We will then use these best practices to optimize our instance and performance tune our queries to make the system faster.

##Title: JSON and the Astronauts##
 
**Abstract**:
In one small step, SQL Server 2016 has taken a giant leap...to JSON! In this session, we'll launch a probe into a JSON data file containing profiles of NASA astronauts using new JSON T-SQL functions in SQL Server. With each astronaut we meet, we'll learn to validate, read, and manipulate "unstructured" JSON data. We'll get The Right Stuff to start developing, no previous JSON experience required. Let's go where NoSQL has gone before!

Prerequisites:
You should have experience writing queries in T-SQL. No previous knowledge of JSON is needed.

##Title: Why candidates fail the job interview in the first minute##
 
**Abstract**:
In the last two decades Thomas always had more open positions than I could fill, not because of lack of applicants, I must have interviewed close to 300 people for DBA, database developer, data architect, data modeling and other data related positions. Come to this highly interactive session to learn why 99% of the candidates failed the simplest questions and disqualified them self.

Thomas will share what he misses in resumes and how to respond to questions better.

##Title: Will my workload run faster with In-Memory OLTP?##
 
**Abstract**:
There are compelling reasons to consider deploying In-Memory OLTP, vastly improved in SQL 2016, and now running on non-Enterprise editions. 

What are the use cases? 

What are the tradeoffs? 

We will lift the veil of confusion that surrounds this blazingly fast feature. By the end of the session, you will understand how In-Memory OLTP works and whether your workload is likely to see an increase in performance.

##Title: Modern Data Modeling for Azure Data Lake and Azure SQL DW##
 
**Abstract**:
The principles of dimensional modeling for data warehousing, especially the work of Dr. Ralph Kimball, have been enormously successful for many years. But are they still relevant to the world of data lakes and big data? And what is their role in a modern DW of a relational database, even massively parallel databases like Azure SQL DW? 
      
This presentation will explore when the concepts of dimensional modeling are still relevant to give value to your Data Lake and Big Data solutions and then cover the reason why a modern DW on Azure SQL DW is still needed. It will conclude with some implementation details of a Modern DW on Azure SQL DW, that relate to modeling including how to maximize performance by minimizing Data Movement (Shuffle Move and PartitionMove operations).

##Title: Query Optimization Statistics : Driving Force Behind Performance##
 
**Abstract**:
When the SQL Server optimizer evaluates a query to determine how best to execute it, the statistics are quite possibly the most important tool at its disposal. But SQL Server statistics objects aren’t perfect because they only contain estimated summary information. In this session, we’ll start with an overview of what the statistics objects are, how the optimizer uses them, and some general guidelines for their maintenance. Then we’ll look at some of the issues, how to find them, and how to solve them, that can arise due to their imperfection: ascending keys (the most prevalent statistics based performance killer?), correlated predicates, skewed distribution, or downright bad summary information. There’ll be many examples, and even a stored procedure to help you find ascending keys. By applying the techniques we’ll discuss, you WILL see improved query performance.

##Title: Well, actually...  How to not be THAT guy in IT##
 
**Abstract**:
Unless you've been in a cave, you've seen articles lately on what it's like to be a woman in tech. In 2017, waves of blogs and news articles tell us about those extreme examples of misogyny. Only they aren't fringe, one-off stories.  It's happening to women you know.
IT can be an inhospitable place for women. Some call it a "bro-grammer" culture. Compared to men, women are leaving IT at 2.5x and are interrupted 3x as often. Our credentials are called into question.  We're called emotional or aggressive. We have our own job explained to us. Sometimes its subtle.  Other times it's overt. There's always that one guy who ruins it for the rest of you. 
It doesn't have to be that way.  Most of the guys we work with are stand-up, respectable WIT allies.  The problem is, you don't always notice when it happens.  Learn what those subtle forms of sexism look like at work.  Learn how you can stop that guy in his tracks.  Learn how to not BE that guy, even when you're just trying to help.

##Title: Python in SQL Server 2017##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2017 is right around the corner, bringing with it a host of exciting new features.  Of particular interest to BI practitioners and data scientists is the integration of the Python programming language into the SQL ecosystem.  This integration opens up a number of possibilities for in-database analytics and intelligent database applications, so let's get started!

In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the Python language and then look at how to install and administer Machine Learning Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of Python by showing you how to create and run simple scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.  Finally, we'll go through some examples of how to use Python to integrate data analytical methods in real-world situations, and wow your customers with the power of analytics!

He will talk about the different ways they are used and how you can make good indexes even better. You will leave this session understanding the basics of indexes and how they work, which is crucial to making your queries and servers perform well.

##Title: Linux Administration for the SQL Server DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
Times are certainly changing with Microsoft’s recent announcement to adopt the Linux operating system with the release of SQL Server 2017, and you should be prepared to support it. But, what is Linux? Why run your critical databases on an unfamiliar operating system? How do you handle the basics, such as backing up to a network share or add additional drives for data, logs, and tempdb files?

This introductory session will help seasoned SQL Server DBAs understand the basics of Linux and how it differs from Windows, all the way from basic management to performance monitoring. By the end of the session, you will be able to launch your own Linux-based SQL Server instance on a production-ready VM.

##Title: SQL Server Take Over:  Establishing a Baseline##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Take Over:  Establishing a Baseline

Performance assessment and tuning for the beginner DBA
 
Have you ever inherited a group of servers with not a lot of documentation to accompany them?   Do you have a lot of undocumented or new servers in your environment and you want to establish some baseline configuration setting prior to making changes? You need up to date information on the system very quickly. 
 
The server is running slowly... or is it? Slow compared to what?  Before you being digging into performance issues, there are some baseline metrics you should have established. Only after the information has been gathered, can a plan of attack be developed to help resolve issues with performance. Attendees in this session will learn how to quickly  gather information, review the results and get an action plan on the next step in performance tuning.

##Title: Why is my DBA So Grump? Real Reasons Why Some Code Practices Cause Issues.##
 
**Abstract**:
One of the interesting things about the SQL Server community is how often best practice advice that is widely knows and non-controversial is also widely ignored. Have most of us heard that using NOLOCK is bad? Yes, almost certainly. Does NOLOCK still get used heavily in production code? Yep, you betcha. Presumably the issue is not that we don't care whether or not code is written correctly ... we're all professionals and take pride in our work. It seems more likely that those responsible for the care and feeding of database servers haven't found the right way to explain _why_ some of these practices matter. Come hear Rick's attempts to explain why some code patterns are problematic. Topics covered will include NOLOCK, heaps, and cursors among others.

##Title: Tame Your Unruly Data With Constraints##
 
**Abstract**:
Bad data comes in many forms: duplicate rows, wrong data type, invalid values, and orphaned or missing foreign keys. Time is wasted cleansing, reviewing and correcting data, not to mention the potential hazards bad data can cause. This introductory presentation will explain the data types and constraints available in SQL Server, and how they can replace or augment business rules that would otherwise be written in application or procedure code. Performance benefits provided by constraints will be demonstrated. We will examine the various system views and procedures that describe constraints and how to use them to document your databases. You will be able to apply this knowledge to your database environments and see significant improvements in data quality, performance, and reliability.

##Title: SQL Server Then and Now: Changing the State of Long-held Beliefs##
 
**Abstract**:
We’ve all heard the rules for SQL Server like separate your data from your log, watch for a disk queue length over 2, and a low Page Life Expectancy always means memory pressure.  All of these used to be true, but on today’s hardware and SQL Server versions – they are dangerously outdated.  In this session, we will take on a bunch of these old “givens” of SQL Server that everybody has heard and followed, the underlying technological reasons they were true then, how today’s technology has rendered them obsolete, and what the new rules are that you need to know.  So whether you are one of the old guard looking to refresh your set of working SQL Server rules or a member of the up-and-comers looking for the facts to win over the old guard, this session is for you.

##Title: DAX Filters: A Quest for Clarity##
 
**Abstract**:
If you are working with SSAS Tabular, Power BI, or good ol' Power Pivot for Excel, you've likely run into a need for DAX, the formula and query language of these tools.  A very common task is to augment, override, or otherwise modify a filter context.  This sounds easy enough, but if you've had experience beyond simple filters, the syntax and behavior may seem confusing, or worse, counter-intuitive. The purpose of this presentation is to discuss the different types of filters, their behavior, and their interactions with other DAX formulas.

Do you have trouble remembering common administrative T-SQL commands? Remember when you created a cheat sheet in school to help you study for an exam?  Use that same principle with the DBA Cheat Sheet! The DBA Cheat Sheet is a document filled with some basic administrative TSQL commands you’ll need in your daily work. During the session I’ll show you a few SSMS tricks and review some of the topics in the DBA Cheat Sheet document.  You’ll leave the session with a document that you can use as a reference every day.
