## Title: Much Ado About Indexes - Tips, Tricks and TSQL
 
**Abstract**:
Much Ado about Indexes - Tips, Tricks and Tuning.. In my session, I will offer some practical tips and tricks on a wide-array of Index Analysis methods that will allow you to find out everything about a client's indexes and were afraid to ask! What better way to optimize the performance of the database than talk about their indexes. What do you need to know in order to make these suggestions, and implement them. This session will cover the basics on indexes, and then demonstrate ways to improve DB performance. Missing Indexes, Duplicate Indexes, Fragmented Indexes, Covering Indexes, Clustered  Nonclustered indexes, and the queries that love them. I will also demo how to correlate the worst performing queries with missing indexes

## Title: Database design for mere developers 
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2012: Efficient and effective database design is so important that leaving it solely to the DBAs is simply not a solution. We as developers will more than likely have to create applications to access the data stores and as such must ensure that all application related considerations are taken into account within the database design.In this session, (aimed at software developers) we shall be touching upon several concepts of special importance to the developer. These include database development "patterns and anti-patterns", final proofing of design and creating versatile deployment scripts that can and will be utilized in future endeavors.

## Title: Building Tabular Analysis Models in Excel 2013
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft Excel is the most popular data analysis tool in use. But most users tend to extract data for their analysis and end up with large volume spreadsheets that only they can understand and use. Data Analysts outside the official IT Department need a tool that will allow them to build and browse data models without extensive time lag to stand up traditional SSAS cubes.

Learn how to build SSAS Tabular Models in Excel and Visual Studio. Skirt around Tabular's Parent/Child limitation using DAX Expressions. Use Excel 2013 and SharePoint to build PowerView reports to visualize data trends. Browse a Tabular Model with the DAX Query language.

## Title: Building Your Own Monitors with the SQL Agent
 
**Abstract**:
See those things around your ankles? You hope they're your socks because no DBA wants to be caught with their pants down.

Whether you're an accidental DBA, a DBA who has just inherited a bunch of servers, or someone who works in a shop that won't buy monitoring tools, this session will help you get basic monitoring in place to make sure you know what's going on in your environment.

You'll learn how to implement simple scripts that perk their ears up and start barking like a dog after a stranger walks in the house. They are the canary in your coal mine. You'll know when backups fail, when they run longer than usual, when data files are getting full, when transaction logs have excessive VLFs, and more.

## Title: Database Backups for the Accidental DBA
 
**Abstract**:
You've fallen into a job that requires you to manage a SQL Server Database Management System. Now you have to keep these databases on their feet. You've heard of this concept called a backup, and it sounds great, but you sure don't know what it is. This session is for you. We're going to go over backups, right from the beginning, so that when you come out of this session you can go back to your systems and set up backups, log backups, differentials, and anything else you might need. Further, you'll know how to recover your database in the event of an actual failure. The fundamentals you need to get a good backup in place and then be able to restore it will be covered in this session.

## Title: Temporal Fact Tables: The Road Less Traveled
 
**Abstract**:
Snapshot fact tables are a common approach when a point-in-time reference is required. In some cases though, even snapshots are not an option due to the amount of data it will generate.

In this session we will walk through a practical example of when and how to implement temporal fact tables, and how these can be a viable alternative to snapshots in certain situations.

## Title: Network or Perish
 
**Abstract**:
As IT personnel, we tend to get boxed-in, stranded on our own little island. We fail to make people aware of our activities, both within our own organization and in our wider professional circles. Just like a shipwrecked captain waiting for the rescue boat on a desert island, if you fail to communicate, your career will be stuck with no possibility of progression. This presentation will show you how to leverage networking and self-marketing techniques that will allow you to set sail off the island and into new opportunities.

## Title: Build your own Virtual Lab
 
**Abstract**:
If you don't have the chance to work on different kinds of projects, it may be tough to grow all the necessary skills to further your career. By building a virtual lab at home, you can take control of the situation.

This session will focus on setting up a basic network environment using VirtualBox, free (downloadable) software, and your home computer. It's aimed towards individuals that aren't afraid to modify server settings or use the command line. This session is focused mainly on virtualization and networking topics, and not so much on SQL Server. However, you'll be in the position to tackle larger projects, such as SQL Server clustering or Availability Groups, once complete.

## Title: I 'wanna' learn SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
This presentation is meant to introduce the power of SQL Server to the "total novice". Often folks arrive at SQL Saturdays hoping to attend a session aimed at the novice. Well this is your chance!!. This hands on presentation assumes that you know NOTHING about SQL Server and that you must come up to speed in a minimal amount of time. We shall learn about the varied components of the product and end up creating a few simple queries, giving you enough knowledge to go back to your workplace and to perform like a star.

## Title: Best Practices Document
 
**Abstract**:
As DBAs we are often straddled with writing a best practices document. In this session, I will start with a bare bones template and then we can collectively come up with a Best Practices Document by the end of the session. I challenge you that this document can come in handy, no matter where you go.If time permits, we can also discuss how to implement this in organizations with varying degrees of acceptance.

## Title: Query Tuning in the Clouds
 
**Abstract**:
Just because you're using an Azure SQL database does not mean you can avoid tuning queries. Microsoft has throttling in place that could seriously impact your systems if your queries are using up lots of resources. This session will introduce you to the tools you have available to identify poor performing queries, such as dynamic management objects and others. You'll learn how to understand why a query is running slow using the Azure Portal execution plans. This understanding will enable you to fix your poorly performing queries.  All in the cloud.

## Title: Best Practices for Monitoring Databases on VMware
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server on VMware???  Many of our customers are either virtualizing databases or planning to do so soon. I hear from many groups that attempted running their database on VMware but went back to physical hardware because of performance issues. There are many reasons this may have happened, but quite often the decision to go back to physical was not based on hard facts. This presentation will explore the fundamentals of monitoring databases running in a VMware environment. If you are using classic O/S monitoring tools, you may be getting misleading data. Understand what metrics are important and how to get to that data.

## Title: SQL Server Storage Engine under the hood 
 
**Abstract**:
How SQL Server performs I/O

How is SQL Server really accessing the data and log files on the disk? What's done asynchronous and what's  synchronous and what impact does that have on our queries and DML statements.
Which impact have features  like database mirroring and replication, what's different when SQL Server is starting up.
Â 
Which I/O Subsystems (including SSD) are best for which type of data and what's the impact if you choose a different one.  Which files can be placed on the same volume and which should not.

## Title: Database Design: Size DOES Matter
 
**Abstract**:
Great database performance starts with great database design. During the database design process it is important to select your datatypes wisely. The wrong choices will often lead to wasted space, increased response times, and less stability. Additionally you run the risk of having your design not scale as well as it should. Leave this session armed with the knowledge you need to help your databases perform at their peak efficiency.

## Title: Establishing a SLA
 
**Abstract**:
Most DBA's rarely establish Service Level Agreements (SLA) with the Management and if they do they sometimes just come up with some random numbers for availability. Then when at some point something goes really wrong everybody wonders why it takes so long to bring everything back online.
Â 
This Session will teach you how to ask the right questions, analyze your databases and servers and generate from the gathered data a realistic SLA.
