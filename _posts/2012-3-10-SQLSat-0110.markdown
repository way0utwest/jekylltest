## Title: Building Your Own SQL Server Virtual Playground
 
**Abstract**:
As the number of SQL Server versions and features grow over time so does the the difficulty in maintaining a set of tools for working with all of them on your local machine. Add in that some features require multiple physical instances and suddenly a single installation isn't enough. Need to quickly switch between versions and editions of SQL Server? Want to learn how to set up clustering? Or maybe you want to try out the latest SQL 2012 release candidate...virtualization offers a convenient way to do any or all of these. In this session we'll show you how by covering the fundamentals of desktop virtualization and demonstrating how to set up a virtual playground on your own machine.

## Title: SQL Server Security for Developers
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server has a robust and granular system for granting and denying access to users, but all too often we see applications running as DBO or even sysadmin. Why? Part of is that same granular system can be overwhelming and part is that many developers don't see the point in applying such granular security. In this introductory level presentation we'll start at the beginning with creating and managing logins, take a quick look at system roles, and then get into the nitty gritty of users and roles and permissions at the database level. Along the way we'll talk about why its so important to set security at the database and not just rely on the application enforced security.

## Title: Reporting Services Deep Dive
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Reporting Services is a fundamental part of Microsoft’s Business Intelligence suite of products which as its name suggests provides a centralized robust reporting solution for organizations. Using a familiar development environment we can create static and interactive reports that can be delivered to consumers in a variety of ways. In this deep dive session, I will cover topics like: - What is reporting services and what can it be used for? - New Features included in 2008 R2 - Architectural Overview - Demonstrations to cover the entire process of developing, deploying and rendering reports using the built in Report Manager and URL Access. 
** This session is SQL Saturday favorite and is always packed full. Don't miss it!!!

## Title: Running SQL Server 2012 on Server Core: Why  How
 
**Abstract**:
Do you cringe every time "Patch Tuesday" rolls around?  Does the idea of applying 70-80% fewer Windows patches on your SQL Servers appeal to you?  Join us and learn about this and other benefits that can be achieved by running SQL Server 2012 (Denali) on the Core edition of Windows Server.  While Core edition has been used primarily for infrastructure servers like Domain Controllers and DNS servers, SQL Server 2012 now brings support for running the database engine.  This session will talk about when you may want to consider running SQL on Server Core and will guide you through the task of installing and configuring your server when you no longer have most of the Windows configuration tools that you may be used to.

## Title: Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!
 
**Abstract**:
Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!

## Title: It's In There Somewhere! 
 
**Abstract**:
FileTable and Statistical Semantic Search In SQL 2012
It’s like having the biggest junk drawer EVER.  That’s often what our “Document Repositories” become.  You know you have that golden nugget of information that you’re searching for, and it’s in there somewhere, but you can’t find it.  Using the new features of Statistical Semantic Search in SQL 2012 is like having a closet organizer on staff at all times.  While full-text search lets you query the words in a document, semantic search lets you query the meaning of the document. New scenarios we will explore will include automatic tag extraction, related content discovery, and hierarchical navigation across similar content.

## Title: Table Vars  Temp Tables - What you NEED to Know!
 
**Abstract**:
Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"

## Title: Design and Implement BI Like Edison! 
 
**Abstract**:
As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor. In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence.

## Title: Service Broker - Why, When and Where?
 
**Abstract**:
Messages, Queues, Contracts, Services, Routes, Endpoints, Transport and Dialog security…What could be easier to understand? While complexity of implementation is one of the factors that make us afraid of using service broker there is another one - we often don't recognize the use cases where service broker would benefit a system.

This session focuses on the latter case. While it provides very high level overview of Service Broker Architecture, the goal of this presentation is to discuss WHEN to use Service Broker. This session outlines several service broker-friendly patterns and shows a few examples based on real life Service Broker implementations in both centralized and distributed systems.

## Title: STOP! Consolidate and Listen!
 
**Abstract**:
In today's economic times, we are being asked to do more with less. Less budget, less hardware and yet our data needs keep growing! So how do we keep our database infrastructure humming along given these restrictions? In this session we will talk about different options of consolidation including: database-level consolidation, instance-level consolidation, and virtualization. Additionally we will also talk about some of the tools and methods you can use today to help you consolidate your SQL Server environment and do more with less!

## Title: Introduction to Execution Plan
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wonder what happens when a query is processed?  Got a process that is running slow at the office and your boss in looking at you for answers?  Want to look like a hero to your boss for fixing something that no one else could figure out?  Then you might want to consider this session.  Execution plans tell you what steps were taken to generate the results sets you did.  In analyzing these plans, you can figure out what you are doing that is not efficient, so you can fix it.  This session will give you the foundation you will need to do analysis so you can write better code and help your company with their performance issues.

## Title: Little in the middle but got much [Write]Back
 
**Abstract**:
Often missing from many BI projects is the ability for users to quickly and effectively submit data BACK to the reporting system.  Luckily, when these reporting systems are built from a SSAS cube foundation, we have a potential answer.

Writeback is often an underused feature in SSAS cubes.  In this session, attendees will learn how to create their own writeback partitions, and create end user interfaces to submit data to them in Excel.  Also a deep-dive into the architecture of the writeback implementation in SSAS will be covered, as well as some limitations to the technology that are important to know before designing a solution.

## Title: AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
 
**Abstract**:
In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic fail-over using a real web app to see how well this feature works.
