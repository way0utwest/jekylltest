##Title: Performancesteigerung durch Window Functions##
 
**Abstract**:
Durch die Einführung von Window Functions ergeben sich viele neue Ansätze für die Lösung bestehender Aufgaben. In der Vergangenheit haben sich andere Lösungswege etabliert, die aber heute wesentlich eleganter und für die Performance deutlich positiver neu geschrieben werden können. In dieser Session wollen Uwe Ricken und Christoph Muthmann gemeinsam anhand typischer Aufgabenstellungen zeigen, welche alternativen Wege zum Einsatz kommen können. Anschließend werden die Performance-Aspekte dieser Lösungen untersucht und anhand der Ausführungspläne die Auswirkungen auf die Zugriffswege gezeigt. Ziel der Session ist zum einen ein Grundverständnis im Lesen von Ausführungsplänen zu erreichen und zum anderen anzuregen, über das Redesign einiger Queries mittels Window Functions nachzudenken.

##Title: Anwenden u. Erweitern des SSIS CatalogDB für ein Logging Framework##
 
**Abstract**:
Seit der Version SQL 2012 haben die Integration Services mit der SSISDB eine eigene Datenbank.
Darin werden u.A. die Paketausführungen / bzw. die -Ergebnisse gespeichert.
Im Logginglevel  VERBOSE/ASUFÜHRLICH  werden zusätzlich auch die "verarbeiteten Zeilen"
im DataFlow-Task erfasst. Für andere Verarbeitungen z.B. im T-SQL Task ist das Logging anzupassen.
Der Vortrag zeigt zunächst die Konfiguration, die Ausführung  sowie die Auswertung im DataFlow-Task,
so wie das Logging "out-of-the-box" bereits enthalten ist.
Anschließend erfolgt ein T-SQL MERGE für eine 'SlowlyChangingDimension'.
Hierbei sind die internen SSISDB StoredProcedures aufzurufen, um das gleiche Logging-Ergebnis
zu erhalten.
Obgleich SQL 2012 für die .dtsx-Files bereits ein "übersichtlicheres" XML aufweist,
sind einige xml-Queries hilfreich, um auch den Admins einen "Blick-ins-Package"
zu ermöglichen.
..und fürs Reporting können die 5 enthaltenen Reports mit eigenen ergänzt werden.

##Title: Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark - MS SQL Server vs. MongoDB##
 
**Abstract**:
Big Data und Cloud-Anwendungen sind zwei Stichworte, die häufig mit der technischen Entwicklung der letzten Jahre in Verbindung gebracht werden. Längst machen sich die Global Player wie Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook oder Twitter Gedanken darüber, wie sich Terabytes der in der Cloud anfallenden Daten besonders effektiv verwalten lassen. An dieser Stelle wird zunehmend die Speichertechnik sogenannter schemaloser bzw. NoSQL-Datenbanken  nachgefragt. Ist die erreichbare Performance solcher NoSQL-Datenbanken tatsächlich so viel höher als die der traditionellen relationalen Datenbanken? Dieser Frage soll mit dem von der Firma Yahoo! entwickelten Cloud Serving Benchmark Framework (YCSB) nachgegangen werden. Im Benchmark soll MongoDB als Vertreter der NoSQL-Familie gegen den SQL Server als Kandidat der traditionellen relationalen Systeme antreten. Der Benchmark und die Ergebnisse der Messungen werden erläutert und hinsichtlich der Performance bewertet, verglichen und interpretiert.

##Title: SSIS Custom Data Flow Components##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) include several most important components required in data acquisition, transformation, and load operations. If the problem at hand demands a solution that cannot be solved using the built-in components alone, you can resort to the freely extensible Script Component, but when the circumstances also call for a more complex, and more robust solution, that will be deployed to more than one destination server, the more appropriate alternative is to design a Custom Component.In this session you will learn how this can be achieved, what advantages it provides, and how to perform even the most complex data transformations in a standardised and reliable environment.

##Title: SSIS und HDInsight - Zwei Welten treffen aufeinander?##
 
**Abstract**:
HDInsight ist der auf Hadoop basierende Dienst von Microsoft, der eine 100-prozentige Apache Hadoop-Lösung in der Cloud zur Verfügung stellt. Mit HDInsight steht eine Cloud-basierte Big Data Plattform zur Verfügung, die Daten jeden Typs und beliebiger Größe, ob strukturiert oder unstrukturiert verwalten kann. Während mit Hadoop Petabytes von unstrukturierten Daten in einigen Stunden verarbeitet werden können, können mit dem SQL Server Terrabytes von strukturierten Daten in wenigen Sekunden verarbeitet werden. Was liegt da näher als die beiden Welten miteinander zu verbinden und Daten zwischen HDInsight und SQL Server zu transferieren?

##Title: ROLAP mit der PDW - Endlich der nötige Performanceboost##
 
**Abstract**:
Seit vielen Jahren wird ROLAP als eine Möglichkeit zur Cubebereitstellung angeboten. Die eigentliche Herausforderung, welche wir im jedem Projekt antreffen, ist die Daten auch schnell genug bereitstellen zu können. Mit dem SQL Server 2012 kam ein erster Schritt in die richtige Richtung dank des Column Store. Dieses Feature brachte einen erheblichen Performance-Gewinn. Mit der Einführung der PDW V2 steht dem praktischen Einsatz nichts mehr im Wege. Innerhalb dieser Session möchten wir demonstrieren für welche Zwecke ROLAP sinnvoll ist und für welche nicht.

##Title: Agile Datawarehousing: tips and tricks to deliver your BI solution using Agile methodolgy like SCRUM##
 
**Abstract**:
Now that we all master the delivery of a BI solution using traditional waterfall or V-model software development cycle and SQL Server components, it's time to enter the 21st century and adopt Agile Methodologies:
- Respecting Agile values
- Iterative on functional scopes and not technical ones
- Inscribed in a cycle of continuous improvement for people and solutions
In this session we’ll quickly present what is Agile, and we’ll demo mockup iterations to see how it goes in real life.

##Title: SQL Server 2014 - New Cardinality Estimator##
 
**Abstract**:
In SQL Server 2014 query processing has been improved. What we can expect from new cardinality estimator? Does it really estimate better? Will our execution plans be better after migration to 2014? All of them? Is the key ascending column statistics problem solved in new version? Do we finally can have more than 200 steps in the statistics histogram per table? What about column correlation and cardinality estimates - are the predicates still completely independent?

This session will answers all these questions and will demonstrate new query processing capabilities and compare them with those from SQL Server2012.

##Title: Analyzing Text with SQL Server 2014##
 
**Abstract**:
Text mining is becoming more and more popular. Everybody would like to understand data from blogs, Web sites, and social media.
Microsoft SQL Server in versions 2012 and 2014 enhances full-text search support that was substantially available in previous editions. Semantic Search, a new component in Full-Text Search, can help you understanding the meaning of documents. The Term Extraction and Term Lookup components from SQL Server Integration Services also help with text analysis. However, the question arises: is all this enough? This presentation unveils the good and the bad side of text mining with SQL Server tools.

##Title: Beware of the Dark Side - A Guided Tour of Oracle for the SQL Server DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
Today, SQL Server DBAs are more than likely at some point in their careers to come across Oracle and Oracle DBAs.To the unwary this can be very daunting and, at first glance, Oracle can look completely different with little obvious similarities to SQL Server.This talk sets out to explain some of the terminology, the differences and the similarities between Oracle and SQL Server and hopefully make Oracle not look quite so intimidating.At the end of this session you will have a better understanding of Oracle and the differences between the Oracle RDBMS and SQL Server. Although you won’t be ready to be an Oracle DBA it will give you a foundation to build on.

##Title: SAP HANA, Power Pivot, SQL Server - In-Memory-Technologien im Vergleich##
 
**Abstract**:
Das Thema In-Memory ist an sich kein Neues Thema, wir kennen es bereits aus OLAP-Datenbanken. Neu ist aber, dass In-Memory-Technologien in die relationalen Datenbanken oder auch ins Excel Einzug erhalten. SAP hat mit der HANA-Plattform in den letzten Monaten viel Werbung gemacht. Darum möchte ich in dem Vortrag die verschiedenen Plattformen SAP HANA, SQL Server und Power Pivot gegenüberstellen und einen tieferen Einblick geben.

##Title: Node.js for Microsoft SQLServer Nerds##
 
**Abstract**:
This session is to all SQL Server and Windows Azure developers, who want to build sclabble applications using Node.js and MS SQLServer / Windows Azure SQL Database.
Node.js came onto the scene four years ago, offering yet another tool for creating server-side software systems that support scalable Internet applications. 
With the continued support from Microsoft for Nodejs on both Windows and Windows Azure, it is bound to reach great levels. Don't worry if you don't know Node.js - this will not be necessary to understand the session.

##Title: Database Replication - What, How and Why##
 
**Abstract**:
Database replication doesn't get much attention, especially now that the AlwaysOn features have been released into the wild.  

However, replication offers another way to make data available on multiple servers/locations that steps outside of "normal" HA/DR scenarios.

This session will explain what database replication is, what the different parts are that make up the replication architecture and when/why you would use replication.

The content will be valid for all versions of SQL Server from 2005 onward.

##Title: MapReduce in der Praxis##
 
**Abstract**:
Das Programmiermodel MapReduce, welches vor einigen Jahren von Google veröffentlicht wurde, hat Einzug in zahlreiche Systeme erhalten. Dabei wurde es sowohl als eigenständiges System, wie beispielweise bei Hadoop, Disco oder Amazon Elastic MapReduce, aber auch als Abfragesprache innerhalb größerer Systeme, wie beispielweise bei MongoDB, Greenplum DB oder Aster Data, implementiert.
Diese Session stellt gängige Problemstellungen aus der Praxis vor und wie diese mit dem MapReduce Framework von Microsoft HDInsight umgesetzt werden können.

##Title: Datenzugriff mit Entity Framework – brauchbar oder einfach nur langsam?##
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft bietet mit dem ADO.NET Entity Framework einen Objekt-Relationalen Mapper für den Zugriff auf  SQL Server und andere Datenbanksysteme. Dieser Vortrag stellt Entity Framework vor und zeigt wie das Laufzeitverhalten von Entity Framework in typischen CRUD-Szenarien ist. Dr. Holger Schwichtenberg hat in den letzten Jahren sehr viel Erfahrung mit Entity Framework gesammelt – auch in Projekten mit mehreren Milliarden Datensätzen. Er wird Tricks zur Optimierung von Entity Framework aufzeigen aber auch die Grenzen benennen: Die Fälle, in denen man doch besser SQL verwendet.
