## Title: Accelerated BI Growth with Power View  PowerPivot
 
**Abstract**:
It is a known fact that a low rate of user adoption is a major issue in less than successful BI implementations. The most significant cause could arguably be the lack of simple, intuitive and flexible tools at the reporting/presentation layer. With PowerPivot, Microsoft gave us an easy way to mash-up data models, create Excel reports and surface them through Sharepoint.Now, with Power View in SQL 2012 we have an easy, sexy and compelling way for true business users visualise and present this information. With interactive demos you will learn about Power View, understand its dependencies, learn data model design tips and be made aware of any pitfalls and limitations.

## Title: X-ray Vision For SQL Server Error Logs
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we explore the full potential of the SQL Server Error Log.   The error log is painful to sift through at best, so we turn to Business Intelligence to provide us with an insightful 30,000 view of the error log, and will be amazed at what we can see !We will cover how to extract the error log into a SQL Server database, transform this into a dimensional model where we can apply powerful Analytics and Time Intelligence, and provide insightful visualisations of our errors.   The demonstration will use the SQL Server 2012 Sharepoint platform to demonstrate the pillars of Business Intelligence can be used to benefit DBA's specifically.

## Title: Better Together: Merge, Partitioning, ColumnStore 
 
**Abstract**:
Most SQL Server sessions are based around individual features but SQL Server really shines when you start to combine features. In this session, Greg will provide an introduction to ColumnStore indexes, review Table Partitioning and Merge and show how to combine these features to improve query performance while still being able to load data warehouse data quickly.

## Title: If you had $10K what would you spend it on?
 
**Abstract**:
You are looking at the Bill of Materials for the new shiny server that you are going to purchase for SQL Server and you realise that there is still $10,000 in the hardware budget - how do you spend it?  Do you increase the core density, maybe increase the RAM or maybe even look at adding some solid state storage to the storage array.  In this session we will explore how some small hardware investments made in the right place can pimp your next SQL Server deployment.

Come and Learn more about this pre-built hardware and management software and how to  accelerate the consolidation efforts and eliminate the complexity of managing the database infrastructure for thousands of SQL instances while maintaining an highly performing environment at the same time.

## Title: Migrating Config and Deployment to SSIS 2012
 
**Abstract**:
In SQL 2012, SSIS has had its largest facelift since SQL 2005. A raft of new features have been introduced, and the most significant of them from an ETL framework perspective is the new Project Deployment model. This completely redefines how we could architect and deploy our solutions with configurations supporting multiple environments. It also raises some concerns around upgrading/migrating older solutions.This session briefly looks at common approaches for configuration management in SQL 2008R2. The new 2012 deployment and configuration model is then introduced and we look at how to best migrate these legacy configurations over.

## Title: Tabular Modelling and Design Concepts
 
**Abstract**:
Analysis Service in SQL2012 introduces the Vertipac engine and the tabular model.  While the tabular model is delivered through SSAS, the model offers some unique design opportunities for users who would otherwise design a dimensional OLAP solution.  This session looks at tabular modelling by comparing it to the multidimensional model.  We address some of the advantages, considerations and restrictions of the tabular model and examine how the limitations of the native model can be overcome with DAX (the tabular query language).

## Title: The MERGE Statement - T-SQL's Swiss Army Knife
 
**Abstract**:
Despite being around since SQL Server 2008 MERGE is one of the most underappreciated features in T-SQL. In many ways it's the Swiss Army Knife, able to be used in many different situations. It's not without it's frustrations though, and you'll see both sides of this useful tool in this presentation.

## Title: Golden Nuggets 
 
**Abstract**:
Too much data to think about and no idea where to start?  Let the machine to the thinking and give data mining a try!  This presentation looks into data mining: what it is, how to get it up and running, how to know if it makes any sense and (more importantly) how the use it.  We look at the development and evaluation of models and then put them to work so they can be used to produce tangible benefits for your end users.

## Title: Analytic T-SQL Functions in 2012
 
**Abstract**:
There are a bunch of new T-SQL functions in SQL Server 2012, and as usual  there's a combination of the "this is really useful" and the "...but there's a caveat". In this presentation, Rob will take you through the new analytic functions, show you how they seriously enhance your reporting ability, and show you some of the ways that they don't behave the way you might expect. You may not be using SQL Server 2012 yet, but you're bound to recognise some of the problems that these functions solve.
