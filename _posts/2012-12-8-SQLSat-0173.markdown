##Title: The Art of Questions and success as an IT Pro##
 
**Abstract**:
Data professionals spend a lot of time asking questions. You spend countless hours refining your techcial skills but how much time do you spend learning researching and practicing the art of asking questions? 

What might happen to your career if you did? 

This session presents a bit of theory on the art and science of questions. Here's a question for you: Did you know that asking "why" questions can make people feel defensive and can color the way they respond to you? Strange but true. We'll review some of the biggest mistakes you can make when asking questions and I’ll offer a few some tips on how you can turn mediocre questions into great questions. 

And oh yeah. I'll leave time for asking questions at the end.

##Title: “ColumnStore” Indexes for Fast EDW Query##
 
**Abstract**:
This session will introduce the new xVelocity Memory-Optimized Columnstore Index feature of SQL 2012. This presentation will describe what a column store index is, how this feature is used to store data by columns instead of by rows and compare the advantages and disadvantages between the two storage methods. Live demos will explore how to create columnstore indexes, when to create them, best practices for using them and typical data warehouse scenarios that can leverage the columnstore index to drastically speed up data warehouse queries, in many cases by a factor of 10 to 100, so you are equipped to start implementing this feature into your database environment.

##Title: SQL Server 2012 Columnstore index##
 
**Abstract**:
It might seem far-fetched that a company would upgrade to SQL Server 2012 “just” for a database index.  But after you see the performance enhancements gained from the new columnstore index in SQL Server 2012, you’ll see why many are calling this one of the most important features in the history of SQL Server.  In this presentation, I’ll talk about the physical aspects of  columnstore index in SQL Server 2012, how to create it, and what environments  (mainly data warehousing environments) and queries can make use of it.  I’ll show performance benchmarks between columnstore indexes in SQL Server 2012, and compare them to index strategies prior to SQL Server 2012.  I'll also show how the new Batch execution mode can improve performance as well

##Title: Using Expressions to Avoid Three SSRS Annoyances##
 
**Abstract**:
As powerful as it is, SQL Server Reporting Services still has frustrating annoyances. Three in particular are: 1) non-queried parameter values must be entered one value at a time, with lots of clicking along with way; 2) the page header and page footer sections cannot contain data regions and therefore cannot display sets of data-driven values; and 3) matrix reports promise the analytical ability of Excel PivotTables but fall short because they are fixed and lack the ability to dynamically slice-and-dice data by values selected by the user. With the expression techniques taught in this session, these annoyances will annoy no longer because you will be able to work around all three.

##Title: Getting Started with MDX: The (Very) Basics##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.

##Title: PerfTuning: Intro To Execution Plan Analysis##
 
**Abstract**:
Topic will provide a more in depth look into query execution plans and is targeted for junior to senior DBA’s. You will learn how to identify what indexes are being used by the SQL optimizer, different type of index operations that are performed by SQL server and what operations are generally considered as a preferred method of data retrieval. We will discuss how to determine if indexes used by the optimizer are the optimal ones and the exceptions to the rules.   Finally we will discuss the relationship between different types of index operation and different types of join types within SQL Server including how the SQL Optimizer determines which join type it will use and pros and cons of each type.

##Title: Table Vars  Temp Tables - What you NEED to Know!##
 
**Abstract**:
Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"

##Title: Taking BI to the Next Level: Collaboration##
 
**Abstract**:
Self-service BI is usually an independent activity. But when individuals discover interesting information that they want to share, they need a centralized location to do that. When people work together, new insights are possible, and that’s what collaboration is all about. As more people see the benefits of the solution, they become more likely to use it. As individual products, SQL Server 2008 R2, SharePoint 2010, and Excel 2010 expand your options for enabling BI in your organization, but collectively they create a solid platform for collaborative BI. Knowing which tool to use for which job can be tricky. Come to this session to learn how to use these tools to foster collaboration.

Hi, my name is Jason I'm a practice lead at Redapt. I spend most of my day helping clients solve business problems mostly in the Data and Advanced Analytics spaces. Sometimes this involves various and sundry cloud technologies including Azure Data Factory, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, Azure Data Lake Store, Azure Databricks, HDInsight and Azure SQL Database. I'm fluent in several languages including: SQL, C#, Python, and PowerShell.

I'm a Microsoft Certified Master of SQL Server (MCM) and have been recognized for my technical excellence and evangelism efforts by Microsoft by being awarded the Most Valuable Professional (MVP) for the last 5+ years.

In my off hours I like to snowboard, karaoke, ride roller coasters, and play arcade games

##Title: DBA’s1st Date - Getting to know a new environment##
 
**Abstract**:
With more entry level DBA positions becoming available, and non-DBA’s shifting into DBA roles, you may find yourself in a position where you need to become familiar with a new server environment quickly and efficiently but not know where to begin. To help prevent this for happening, we will review the do’s and don’ts that should be considered when getting to know with a new environment.

##Title: Virtualizing SQL 2012: Doing It Right##
 
**Abstract**:
A database is a very resource intensive by its very nature and one of the most resource intensive applications you will ever virtualize. If best practices are not followed, the database will never perform as needed. This presentation will teach the DBA how to virtualize a business critical application like SQL server 2012. It will be based upon experience learned using VMWare as the virtualization platform. But many of the lessons taught will carry over to any virtualized platform.

##Title:  Isn't that Spatial! (BI Edition)##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, we will walk through the process of building a spatial data
warehouse from the ground up. We will first design a basic spatial data
warehouse, then identify and import a spatial data source by using Microsoft
SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and finally write a spatial query to
provide data to SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). We will also review
basic concepts of working with spatial data in SQL Server.

##Title: DBA Worst Practices, Disasters and Horror Stories##
 
**Abstract**:
Join Brian Moran, Tim Radney, Mike Walsh and perhaps a few more special guests in a panel discussion on some of the worst practices we often see DBAs do. A little secret - we've done them, too. We'll tell you some of the ways you are hurting your databases, tell you about some of the disasters we've been involved in and even share a few horror stories of the ones we've caused. We'll leave plenty of time for QA and give you a chance to share your own or stump us with a "what would you do...." question.

##Title: Windowing Functions in SQL Server 2012##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2012 brings with it nearly full ANSI compliance with the windowing functions. Come to this code filled session to learn about all of the windowing functions in SQL Server 2012: Ranking functions, changes for windowing in the Aggregate functions, and the new Analytic and Sequence functions. We’ll examine how this latest implementation of the windowing functions allows us to perform running and sliding aggregations; retrieve data from adjacent rows in the partition, and much more – all without self-joins back to the source table.

##Title: Revenge: The SQL!##
 
**Abstract**:
Have you been wronged, cheated, lied to, lied about, or deceived by a coworker? Feel like your DBA position offers no opportunity for revenge? WRONG! This session is a light-hearted exploration of some delightfully mischievous SQL design patterns that will annoy, aggravate, and antagonize anyone who has to work with them...even though they deserved it! Learn how to create tables with no names, columns with duplicate names, and write perfectly valid yet utterly nonsensical SQL. You may never get to use these techniques…but you'll ache for the chance!

##Title: Revenge: The SQL Part 2: The Sequel!##
 
**Abstract**:
In a world...where DBAs are blamed, mistreated, and overworked...one man...WILL. GET. EVEN. In this entertaining and impractical follow-up to the entertaining and impractical Revenge: The SQL, Rob Volk will show you even more impractical but oh-so-tempting ways to get back at those who abuse SQL Server and make you clean it up. Techniques will cover: preventing sa use, preventing ad-hoc SQL, cursors and missing WHERE clauses, and the ever-popular trigger mayhem. And if you stay for the after-credits sequence you may encounter the evil twins, duplicate primary keys!

##Title: Common TSQL Mistakes##
 
**Abstract**:
We are going to examine a variety of oopsies MANY developers fall prey too - some obvious, some pretty subtle and some down right sneaky! Lots of code examples with the bad AND good code presented. I GUARANTEE that you will find things here that will either prevent you from getting bad data, throwing unwanted errors or vastly improving your database application's performance.  I have given this talk over a dozen times now and it is always very highly rated!

##Title: Let's Talk Licensing##
 
**Abstract**:
Being a DBA is not all smiles and sunshine; sometimes you have to deal with the tedious topic of licensing. As a DBA, developer, or consultant, you are responsible for ensuring that your company or client is in compliance and can pass software audits. As with any Microsoft product license, there are complicated nuances of the SQL Server licensing program with many new twists added in 2012. This session will help you understand what you can and cannot do with various license types, and, how you could save your company some serious money.
