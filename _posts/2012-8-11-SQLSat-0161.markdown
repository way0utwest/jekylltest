##Title: Master Data Services in SQL Server 2012##
 
**Abstract**:
Most DBAs at one time or another have been taught the importance of master data management(MDM), which is comprised of a set of processes and tools in order to keep your non-transactional data in a consistent state. However, with today’s fast paced environment and tightening budgets most DBAs lack the resources to properly implement it. With the upcoming release of SQL Server 2012, Microsoft has taken their second swipe at providing a tool known as Master Data Services(MDS) to aid the DBA in this endeavor. In this session, you will learn the how Master Data Services is implemented in SQL Server 2012, setting up models,  working through the Excel plug-in, and utilizing DQS and business rules to help with that dirty data.

##Title: You’re My Density: Making Sense of Statistics##
 
**Abstract**:
The Query Optimizer uses statistics to decide how to execute a query. If statistics are out of date, improperly sampled or simply don’t exist, then you could unintentionally deceive the Optimizer. Accurate statistics can help avoid poor query plans, so if you’re not familiar with how to read a histogram, the various options for updating statistics or want to know why sample size does matter, this session is for you! We will also delve into what happens when a value doesn’t exist in a statistic, discuss methods to manage statistics for volatile tables and examine the challenges that exist with statistics on partitioned tables. Expect a session filled with demos and real-world examples that will create a foundation of statistics knowledge.

##Title: Unit Testing made easy for Database Development  ##
 
**Abstract**:
Though most developers agree that unit testing plays an important role in software development, to ensure quality and meet milestones, most developers write unit tests only as an afterthought. Visual Studio Team System (VSTS) helps to mainstream Test Driven Development methodology (TDD) into world of database development.  Unit testing presents a unique challenge in Database development, because of the need to provide a consistent test environment.
In this session, we will not only cover the basis of unit testing concepts and terminology, but also discuss how unit testing helps ensure and document the quality and accuracy of database deliverables. We will run through a demo of creating and running database unit tests using VSTS 2010.

##Title: Anatomy of a Join##
 
**Abstract**:
A lot of database professionals today  do not have a Computer-Science Degree  so they never attended a  “Introduction to Databases” course. In this session we are trying to fix at least one thing and we’ll look in depth at the three types of join operations, visualize how their algorithms work in order to understand how query plans are computed, explain why these join operations have very different performance characteristics and why the optimizer chooses a specific  join operator to use in a query plan. Will demonstrate that empirical cost calculations are similar to what Query Optimizer actually outputs. Good understanding of join algorithms is vital in order to diagnose and remedy issues related to bad query plans.

##Title: Yesterday I Couldn’t Even Spell ‘DBA’.##
 
**Abstract**:
Referred to as “DBA by Default” or “Reluctant DBA”, many people are faced with the situation of suddenly becoming a SQL Server database administrator.  Once the initial shock passes they realize that they need help. The abundance of SQL Server books and websites that exist, some good and some not so good, might only increase confusion leading to panic and rash decisions. DON’T PANIC! In this session we will cover ways to address basic problems and offer some suggestions for finding good places to find help.

##Title: DBCC Commands: The Quick and the Dangerous##
 
**Abstract**:
There are many DBCC statements at the disposal of Database Administrators and Developers. Some are used for the greater good; others can wreak havoc in your system. The majority of these commands are informational, but if you’re not careful you can introduce chaos or at worst, lose data you may never find again. In this session we will explore DBCC commands that are useful for the DBA and developer, and cover when to use them and how. Expect demonstrations that provide a practical application of these commands - both documented and not - that database professionals can utilize quickly and easily.

##Title: PWNED! Security, SQL Server, and You!##
 
**Abstract**:
With an ever increasing workload, security is often hoisted upon the DBA. So where do you start? Sometimes it's better to start off by understanding what an attacker could do to you in order to get a clearer picture of what you need to do to prevent it. In this session, we will delve into the key features of the SQL Server and explain what the various attack vectors are, what an attack can do with them,  and what you can do about them. We'll also look at important features such as SQL Audit that, while not helping to prevent, can definitely help you in definitely help in figuring out what is going on. It'll be AWESOME!

##Title: GeoGRAPHY Spatial Analysis##
 
**Abstract**:
Tired of your PostGIS and Oracle friends bragging about all their geography data?  Microsoft continues to support and add features to the spatial data types.  It is time to let your friends know that Microsoft has stepped up.  In this session we will take a deep look at analyzing the SQL Server Geography spatial data type in T-SQL.  We will look at different scenarios to show how you can begin using the Geography data type.  To begin, we will look at using T-SQL to analyze geographic locations and the surrounding geography data.  Secondly, we will look at using T-SQL to analyze geographic lines such as roads, and borders.

##Title: Dimensional Data Model Prototyping With PowerPivot##
 
**Abstract**:
Data modeling is often an abstract exercise involving a lot of talk and diagrams, but little hands-on experimentation.  This may still be viable in the world of transactional systems where a lack of source data prevents the modeler from quickly creating a prototype system, however in the world of dimensional modeling where source data is abundant there’s no longer a reason to treat data modeling as an academic exercise.  This session will cover how to use PowerPivot for Excel to quickly create prototypes of different dimensional models to try out and discard as necessary.  The features of PowerPivot which allow quick import of data from a variety of data sources will also be demonstrated.

##Title: Practically Normal##
 
**Abstract**:
Normalizing a database - splitting apart tables into simpler, more focused tables - can yield concrete benefits, including manageability, scalability, and space savings.  The concept is a central tenet of a relational database system such as SQL Server, yet far too many database professionals are unfamiliar with it.  This session will present a practical primer on normalization: what it is, why it's beneficial, how to do it, and when not to do it.

##Title: SSMS for Developers##
 
**Abstract**:
You're a database application developer who's using SQL Server now, but you're no DBA. Sure you use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), and maybe you're even pretty good at designing tables and executing queries. But there's a whole lot more functionality in this seemingly simple program than you may realize. In this session we'll share features in SSMS that you may have overlooked but will make your life as a developer a lot easier.

This session is good for anyone who spends some time in SSMS and wants to pick up some time-saving tips and tricks.

##Title: Best Practices for Monitoring Databases on VMware##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server on VMware??? Many of our customers are either virtualizing databases or planning to do so soon. I hear from many groups that attempted running their database on VMware but went back to physical hardware because of performance issues. There are many reasons this may have happened, but quite often the decision to go back to physical was not based on hard facts. This presentation will explore the fundamentals of monitoring databases running in a VMware environment. If you are using classic O/S monitoring tools, you may be getting misleading data. Understand what metrics are important and how to get to that data.
