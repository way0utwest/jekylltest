## Title: Intro to Graph Databases
 
**Abstract**:
Recent years have seen an uptick in the adoption of alternative data storage methods.  While the traditional RDBMS is still the de-facto Swiss Army knife for backing applications, technologies such as NoSQL and time series databases are increasingly used due to their performance and usability characteristics in certain use cases.

One of the latest entrants on the scene is the graph database.  In this session we’ll discuss what they are and how they are used.  The introduction of graph database support in MSSQL 2017 provides us with a convenient mechanism for presenting our existing data through a graph.

•	What is a Graph Database?
•	Basic Graph Theory
•	Relational vs Graph data models
•	Graph Databases in MSSQL
•	Use cases

## Title: SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps is based on building an application binary (immutable artifact) that supports a highly reliable, repeatable engineering process.  In the case of SQL Server, however, a database is already in production, and isn’t simply replaced (as an app binary), but is upgraded.   Current SQL Server DevOps methods use source control to build a “development” database, with schema and objects and static data needed for functional testing.  "Near production data" is used in Staging, and finally production is upgraded.  This approach involves complexity, and breaks the principle of working with immutable artifacts throughout the process.  Our session introduces a new approach to SQL Server DevOps, with production databases used in all stages.   Production database clones are delivered more quickly than "built" databases, are more easily integrated with source control, and produces higher fidelity outcomes.  Learn how leading enterprises are simplifying SQL DevOps.

## Title: Exploring the latest T-SQL enhancements
 
**Abstract**:
With the most recent release of SQL Server 2017 and the upcoming release of SQL Server 2019, there are several enhancements that were introduced for the T-SQL language. This includes new string functions, bulk access options and approximate query processing among others that address several challenges that SQL developers have to confront.  

In this demo heavy session, we will go over several of the new features, provide a demonstration of how you can use them, and share any considerations that you may need to consider before doing so. This session is intended for anyone interested in what’s new in the T-SQL language and will focus primarily just on enhancements to traditional T-SQL for the database engine.

## Title: Get Your Optimizer to Give up All Its Secrets
 
**Abstract**:
You know that execution plans can provide you with vital information to tune a query, but just how does that plan get generated?  In this session, we will examine details the query optimization process that are not very well known.  We will discuss how SQL Server parses a T-SQL statement then and begins applying rules to make it more efficient.  Did you know that SQL Server can be coaxed into outputting hidden structures such as parse trees and memos?  We'll do just that, and then take it a step further with a unique visualization tool that I have created.  With a better understanding of how SQL Server optimizes T-SQL (and sometimes doesn't do it as well as might be hoped), you can write more efficient SQL statements.

## Title: Get your Git on with Source Control
 
**Abstract**:
Have you tried implementing source control? How has your continuous integration (CI) process gone? 

This session is for developers, database administrators, database engineers, and data architects that want to automate their database deployments. Particularly for those individuals that have hit roadblocks along that way. We will discuss the differences between migration and stated-based deployment methods. We will also discuss options with branching and merging. 

At the end of the session, attendees will know how to select the best deployment method for their environment. In addition, attendees will be familiar with branching and merging strategies that can be used as part of their continuous integration strategy.

Attendees should be familiar with general concepts about source control and be comfortable with Visual Studio or VS Code.

## Title: Relational Design Critique
 
**Abstract**:
The process of designing a relational database is not overly complex, and may be done by almost anyone on the development team. The process requires one to take the time to understand the requirements, when they exist, and apply a straightforward set of transforms to produce table structures that meets the needs. The tough part is that the process requires time and experience, neither of which anyone has enough of. In this session, to help the attendee differentiate right-enough designs from overly simple or overly complex designs, we will look at a variety of database snippets, each inspired from a real life design. We will discuss the pros and cons of the approach taken, and consider possible remediations to learn from a failure that was made by someone else.

## Title: That's So Metadata: Discover Your Database From The Inside
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever needed to learn a new database design and don't know where to begin? Or are trying to find out why a query doesn't perform well?  Or need to provide security information to auditors or your security team?

SQL Server has numerous metadata facilities available to help you with these tasks and more. Functions, dynamic management views, and system stored procedures can illuminate details from a single column up through an entire SQL Server instance. We will demonstrate metadata techniques to help you:

- Document your database schema objects such as procedures, functions, tables, columns and indexes
- Investigate performance and look for bottlenecks and tuning opportunities
- Discover metadata to administer your databases backups, index maintenance, and security
- Apply your own metadata using extended properties

We will also cover the official Microsoft documentation on these features and other resources on how to use them.

## Title: The Community Speaks: WIT, LGBTQ, diversity and inclusion.
 
**Abstract**:
Join us as we (yes, including attendees) discuss incidents and look for ways as victims, as by-standers and as event host to react.  Let’s enable each other to do what is right, speak up and support one another. It’s time for the community to come together, make their voice be heard and share ways and tools to deal with these difficult situations. Although some stores are inspired in part by a true incident, they are fictional and do not depict any actual person or event.

## Title: User Experience Brilliance in Power BI Dashboards
 
**Abstract**:
User Experience (UX) and Design Thinking are common buzz words around the office. What do these words have to do with BI and Dashboards, anyway? 
Sure, Power BI itself is intuitive and user friendly, but are YOU building dashboards that give the best user experience? 
In this session we will explore in a hands-on exercise what UX and Design thinking is, how to apply the methodologies to our daily work and then how we could apply it to BI to make kick ass dashboards and reporting for our internal and external customers.

## Title: Managing Your Schema with Database Projects in Visual Studio
 
**Abstract**:
Integrating databases schema changes into a Software Development Lifecycle Management (SDLC) process can be a  daunting and often tedious proposition. Adding the complexity of version control to the mix complicates this scenario. Fortunately, Database Projects in Visual Studio add a bit of an "easy" button to this process. In this session, you will learn about the features and capabilities of VS Database Projects and how to use them to improve the lifecycle of your database structures, even if your organization does no code management.

## Title: Azure Data Factory V2
 
**Abstract**:
Moving data around in On-Prem databases is easy. 

Moving data around when involving Azure - may be not. Especially if you don't have a VM or an On-Prem server to move things around on. 

We'll look at moving data around from On-Prem to Azure, moving files to Azure, and moving data between Azure databases.

That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.
