## Title: SQL Server 2014 and Ascending Key Problem in Large Tables
 
**Abstract**:
The SQL Server Query Optimizer relies on distribution statistics to create the query execution plan. But statistics are almost always out-of-date. For columns with ascending keys the most recent rows don’t exist for statistics objects. And common queries are looking for those rows. This can lead to poorly-performing plans, especially for large tables, where for instance a query that returns a few recent orders for a customer takes several seconds, with a few million logical reads.
In this session we’ll show how to identify columns with ascending keys and also query patterns where this problem occurs. Of course we’ll see how to get well performing plans with the queries in SQL Server 2012. According to documentation about new features in SQL Server 2014 the problem seems to be solved in the latest SQL Server version. But is this really so? What is different in SQL Server 2014? Does the problem still occur? As you guess, all those questions will be addressed and answered in this session

## Title: Introduction to Time Series Forecasting
 
**Abstract**:
Imagine taking historical sales data and using data science to accurately predict future sales values. This is precisely the objective of time series forecasting – to predict future values based on previously observed values.

This session will introduce time series forecasting, and describe how different Microsoft BI products enable forecasting for various audiences, including the business analysts, IT developer, and even the Information Worker.

Topics will include Analysis Services forecasting by using the Microsoft Time Series algorithm with the Excel add-ins (Table Analysis Tools and the Client Tools), SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) and script. This session will also introduce and describe the impressive new forecasting capabilities delivered in Power View with Office 365. As part of Microsoft’s new approach to simplify complex Machine Learning technology, forecasting in Power View enables powerful forecasting capabilities for the unspecialized Information Worker.

## Title: Analytics and the DBA – Using BI Power tools to visualize your SQL Infrastructure
 
**Abstract**:
Using BI Power tools to visualize your SQL Infrastructure DBAs do not always have time to work with some of the amazing visual data tools that are becoming common place now for analysts. In this presentation I will show how in just a few very easy steps you can learn more than the basics of PowerView, PowerPivot and Data Mining using data you are already familiar with as a DBA, your SQL Server installation data. We will look at new and interesting way to load, transform, merge and analyze configuration and performance data for many servers simultaneously. I will also demonstrate how to best utilize that data for reports in Excel, SSRS and Visio to get the most out of automation, standardization and visualization with the new Power tools.

## Title: Professionelles Recycling – SSIS Custom Control Flow Komponenten und Visual Studio Community
 
**Abstract**:
Die SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) sind eine erweiterbare Datenintegrations-Plattform. Reicht die Funktionalität der mitausgelieferten Komponenten nicht aus, so kann mit der Script-Komponente beinahe jede Anforderung umgesetzt werden. Und genau diese Funktionalität ist es, welche man öfter und auch in mehreren SSIS Projekten einsetzen möchte. 
Für ein professionelles Logik-Recycling bieten sich Custom SSIS Komponenten an. Seit der Veröffentlichung der Visual Studio Community Edition ist keine „vollwertige“ VisualStudio Edition für die Entwicklung notwendig. 
In dieser Session werden die notwendigen Entwicklungsschritte, das Zusammenspiel der für die Programmierung benötigten API-Klassen, die Fallstricke beim Deployment sowie die Erfahrungen aus mehr als 6 Jahren SSIS Custom Komponenten Entwicklung mit dem Publikum geteilt.

## Title: How to recover deleted data with no backups?
 
**Abstract**:
From time to time on the forums emerge people in really tough situation: data is deleted, database is in SIMPLE recovery model, and as a cherry on top - there is no backup! It might be boss's private database that nobody has put into backup scheme yet, or some new database that was missing from the backup scheme.
It is nearly impossible to recover the lost data from that situation. But I will show you at least three methods. After this presentation, you will be prepared to solve such a tough case. It is really important to know two simple steps you must do really fast, and after that you can relax and extract the data with peace of mind and without time pressure.

## Title: So you are a BI Developer by Accident
 
**Abstract**:
You might be a DBA who deals with databases or a developer who creates applications, and you hear that you will be appointed to provide a business intelligence solution which will empower decision makers by displaying key measures of your department, company or client. This session is to help you where to start, giving an overview about the complete on-premise BI toolset of Microsoft, along with the analysis of your infrastructure constraints which influence how your BI solution will look like at the end of the day.
The session also helps those who are planning to introduce the BI-related services (SSIS, SSRS, SSAS, MDS, DQS) of SQL Server to their companies, squeezing the last euro out of their SQL Server and Office license investments.

## Title: Identity Mapping and De-Duplicating 
 
**Abstract**:
In an enterprise, merging master data, like customer data, from multiple sources is a common problem. Typically, you do not have a single, i.e. the same key identifying a customer in different sources. You have to match data based on similarity of strings, like names and addresses. In this session, we are going to check how different algorithms for comparing strings included in SQL Server  work. We are going to use four different algorithms that come with Master Data Services (Levenshtein, Jaccard, Jaro-Winkler and Ratcliff-Obershelp), and Fuzzy Lookup transformation from Integration Services. Finally, we are going to introduce how SQL Server Data Quality Services help us here.

## Title: CDC - Change Data Capture in Detail
 
**Abstract**:
Change data capture records insert, update, and delete activity that is applied to a SQL Server table. This makes the details of the changes available in an easily consumed relational format. Column information and the metadata that is required to apply the changes to a target environment is captured for the modified rows and stored in change tables that mirror the column structure of the tracked source tables.

This session demonstrates the basic concepts, detailed components and implementation strategies of CDC.
The demo is based on a real scenario which has been implemented that way!

## Title: Top 10 configuration mistakes that affect your SQL Server performance
 
**Abstract**:
There are always performance problems that could happen in your production database. But you will be surprised how many of them occur as a result of DBA’s actions or lack of attention to SQL Server Instance and database level configuration settings. If you know them and how they harm your database system it will be easier to not get there. During the session Magi shows some of the worst practices in configuring your SQL Server, explains their whys and gives you the hints to the right settings. Sometimes you are just a few clicks away from a good SQL Server configuration. This sessions gets them to your fingers.
