## Title: Using SQL Server tools to Find Performance Bottlenecks
 
**Abstract**:
Abstract: 
Performance is always at the top of every DBA’s list of things to do.  There are many tools that are available that are native to SQL Server.  This session will cover how to use Extended Events, DMVs, Execution Plans and QueryStore to find performance bottlenecks.

Topics to be covered, as well as a few surprises
• Query Timeouts
• Index Fragmentation
• Execution Plan Warnings
• Missing Indexes
• SQL Server Wait information
• Missing Statistics
• Query bottlenecks
• Data type conversion issues
• CPU and Memory Issues
• IO issues
• Deadlocks

This session will also cover a few additional topics such as how to format your SQL code allowing for easier reading.  How to perform a complete server assessment and baseline will also be covered as part of the session.

## Title: Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs often seem so frazzled. This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.

## Title: "Why is My Drive Full?" Understanding SQL Backups - Even if you are not responsible for Backups
 
**Abstract**:
This session will provide an introduction to understanding and configuring  SQL Server backups. It will explain Data files, Transaction Log files, Recover Models, Backup Types as well as show multiple examples of Full, Differential and Transaction Log backups and restores. We will also cover the easiest way to schedule backups and to remove the old backup files.

You will also be shown answers to the following questions?
    What are the different types of Backups?
    What does the Recovery Model setting do?
    Are there conflicting backups happening? 
    Why are the log (ldf) files so big?
    How do I clear space from the log files? 
    How do I shrink the log files?

This is a good introduction, if you need to learn how to backup SQL, want to know more about backups or occasionally need to troubleshoot backup issues.

## Title: Don't just code it—Generate It
 
**Abstract**:
Code Generators are all the rage—BIML, JS frameworks, .NET scaffolding, even the humble templates provide by SSMS for views, stored procedures, functions.
Table-driven applications allow one set of code to handle changing business needs. Metadata-driven code generation takes this a giant step further. If you can describe your code with an algorithm operating against a set of data, you can get a computer to produce the code.
 - Source to Target mapping documents can be used to generate the code to effect the mapping.
 - Service Broker activation stored procedures have a clearly defined structure. They can be mass-produced.
 - Standard CRUD stored procedures can be stamped out cookie-cutter fashion.
 - Business rules can be encoded in data and the code to implement them manufactured.
Generated code has systematic errors. Fix the errors at the generator. All the code now works. If the code is so boring that a computer can produce it, why not spend your talent doing something interesting?

## Title: Power BI Development Best Practices (Deep Dive)
 
**Abstract**:
Are you a developer or analyst, creating Power BI reports that will be shared across teams or even your entire organization? Moving from "quick and dirty" deployments to production ready solutions intended for larger audiences means that you should already be thinking about performance, standardization and (most importantly) your end users.  Bring your laptop to follow along as well!

In this pre-con we will take a deep dive into the considerations and best practices when developing Power BI models, reports and dashboards to help you bridge the gap and make your solutions enterprise ready. Some of the topics we will cover are:
·        Power BI Desktop Configuration
·        Connection Reuse
·        Entity/Table Design
·        Cross Filters
·        Date Entities
·        Aggregates  Measures
Prerequisites
Beginner or intermediate Power BI development experience is required

## Title: Real-World PowerShell for SQL Administration
 
**Abstract**:
If you're like me, you've attended PowerShell sessions before. However, much of the *practical* usage of PS comes with rolling back your sleeves and digging into the nuances of syntax and how to get things done. We are going to focus specifically on using PowerShell within the SQL Server Agent to build out everyday jobs.

In this session, I'm assuming that you know the basics of PowerShell. What we're going to cover are some of the "gotchas" and nuances that I've run into when I've been working with the language, and particularly with the SQL Agent's flavor of PowerShell.

And then we'll spend the balance of our time looking at real-world, practical scripts that I use pretty much every day. PowerShell is an awesome way to automate so many processes and relieve some of the everyday monotony of SQL administration.
