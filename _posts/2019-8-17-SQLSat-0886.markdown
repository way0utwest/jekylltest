## Title: Introduction to Azure Databricks
 
**Abstract**:
Big data processing solutions don't need to be complicated to get up and running, and thanks to Azure Databricks, it isn't! In this session, we'll cover what Azure Databricks is, go over some popular use cases, and what you can expect from an administrative standpoint if you decide to implement solutions with it. We'll also cover the basics of setting up Azure Databricks and go over what goes on "under the covers" in the cloud when you use it to provision compute for your big data processing needs. 

With plenty of demos on how to configure cloud storage, work with Databricks notebooks, and even some Apache Spark thrown in, you'll come to appreciate very quickly just how powerful (and flexible) a solution like Databricks is.

## Title: SSDT, Docker, and (Azure) DevOps: How to Make Your Database Builds a First Class CI/CD Citizen
 
**Abstract**:
Your application developers benefit from Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices to accelerate feature deployment and catch regression issues up front, but your database deployments are still stuck in the proverbial dark ages. The build scripts might be in source control or even an SSDT project already, but deploying is still an exercise in creating the perfect script, and don't even think about making a data (or data type) change!

SSDT and Azure DevOps can solve some of these problems, and even give us a window into the world of automated testing. In this talk, we will explore how to automate your database builds and deployments using SSDT and Azure DevOps, and we will explore automated testing using tSQLt and Docker. Lastly, we will check up on some tasks that you cannot (or should not) automate and talk about how to make sure your application developers are not left behind.

## Title: I have indexes, but do I have the right indexes?
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have all the right indexes on your SQL Server databases?   Have you implemented any indexes other than traditional clustered and non-clustered indexes?  If the answer to either question is a “no” or an “I don’t know”, then this session is for you.

This session will help introduce less commonly used index types and settings along with indexing methodologies.  Follow along while we learn which indexes your SQL Server is begging you to make and others it wishes you would drop.  Learn use cases for filtered, full-text, and columnstore indexes.  There will be plenty of demos and shareable scripts to showcase the benefits too!

Are you using a version and edition of SQL Server is able to use these features?  We’ll cover that too and you’ll leave this class with a repeatable indexing methodology you can use to improve your database performance.

## Title: Extending DevOps To SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Most organizations are under pressure to speed up the software delivery cycle, whether that’s to respond more quickly to the needs of the business, the needs of your customers or just to keep up with the competition.  Unfortunately the database is commonly considered a bottleneck.  Without the right processes in place, database change management can slow things down, adding risk, uncertainty, and getting in the way of development and operations working together to deliver.  Any organization that wants to fully benefit from a DevOps approach is going to have to overcome some specific challenges presented by the database. This session will teach you how to take DevOps principles and practices and apply them to SQL Server so that you can speed up the database delivery cycle at the same time you protect the information contained within.

## Title: SQL Server Machine Learning Services
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2017 Machine Learning Services is more than just R and Python language support for SQL Server.  SQL Machine Learning Services provides analytics for any size of data, runs in SQL Server, or alongside Windows, Linux, HDInsight Spark or Hadoop clusters, is simple to administer and allows you to integrate and deploy simply.  In this session, learn architecture and deployment options, focused on in-database deployment, along with some real-world use-cases.  Learn how to leverage Machine Learning Services with new TSQL PREDICT language support, training and deploying models, scaling beyond memory with RevoScaleR to generating millisecond predictions in-database.  With any size data environment, SQL Machine Learning Services can provide analytics in both an operationally sound and easy to administer paradigm.

A beginner level understanding of Machine Learning and process is highly recommended but not required.

## Title: Stuck In the Middle: Collaborating With Multiple Stakeholders
 
**Abstract**:
Let’s face it – your management and peers have no idea what you’re doing, how much work and time it takes or even what you do as a database professional. Your role is stuck in the middle.  Management is reluctant to prioritize the money to create better equipment and software updates. Developers don’t want you messing with their work.  Both are annoyed when you bother them with a customer problem or when you can’t fix issues instantly. This dynamic triad (you, developers and management) will always have differing views but this diversity of thought can be leveraged to create powerful customer solutions. In this session, you’ll learn simple techniques to build collaboration, mitigate conflict, meet the customer needs and get everyone on the same page.

## Title: CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming
 
**Abstract**:
This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.

## Title: Ansible Automation for MSSQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Automation is now required. For DevOps, for Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), for Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), for user self-service, and for overworked staff, automation is the buzzword. Ansible provides that cross-platform functionality with minimal effort. In this session we'll install and configure MSSQL on a Windows host, install and configure a fail-over cluster on RHEL hosts using pacemaker and availability groups, and provision and deploy a new schema to an existing instance all utilizing playbooks. Also, we'll walk through getting started and example use-cases.

## Title: Creating Your Own ETL Automation Framework with Biml for Beginners
 
**Abstract**:
You may have heard of Business Intelligence Markup Language or even tried to learn it. But how can you take the time to learn it, while getting the rest of your work done. In this highly interactive presentation, I’ll guide you through the process of learning/using Biml, without sacrificing your daily productivity.

We’ll cover how to: 
Identify “easy” ETL patterns to BimlScript
Take incremental steps in automating these processes
Move to metadata driven BimlScript
Tie it all together into a full-fledged framework

As a bonus, you’ll leave the presentation with a completed framework which dynamically generates most types of flat files that you can use in your own environment.

## Title: What I Learned Stepping onto the Cloud
 
**Abstract**:
Previously titled Stumbling and Bumbling onto the Cloud. In this "non-technical" presentation the presenter regales the audience with the missteps, mistakes, and land mines, encountered over the past year in his role as DBA/Data Architect/Data Lackey. 
When your management says “Cloud First” and you’ve got to ask “How high”, and then work your way into actual solutions, it can lead to some real forehead smacking moments. And by “Cloud First”, they mean Azure First and foremost. 
If this sounds like a direction in which you will be headed, or you enjoy Schadenfreude…
Remember a smart person learns from their mistakes, a wise person learns from other people’s mistakes.

## Title: Managing the mystery database
 
**Abstract**:
As database administrators, we often are responsible for managing large amounts of databases so it can be difficult to understand who or what is using each of them and why. Yet we are responsible for making sure these databases are backed up, secure and cared for. As well as, we are responsible for leading projects such as upgrades and migrations where this information becomes relevant. If application owners and documentation exist, we can certainly utilize that, but what if it doesn’t or information is limited. This session will look at tips and tricks you can do to figure out what these mystery databases are so you can make better decisions on them. 

By figuring out what these mystery databases, you will be more equipped to make decisions on several items such as the following: 
•	Decommissions
•	Lower resource allocation and costs (especially for storage)
•	Better planning for database migrations
•	Troubleshoot connection issues
•	Better planning for SQL upgrades

## Title: Learn Like Your Life Depends On It
 
**Abstract**:
You have read this far, great!  I already know this session is for you. How do I know? It is exceedingly rare that today’s “9-5” job provides anywhere near what is needed to develop the career you want to have.  For the purposes of this session it does not matter if you are a newly minted, “wet behind the ears” data professional or a grizzled veteran.  What does matter is that you know that you have a career oriented mindset and a desire to grow beyond what you are today.

This session is designed to help with just that. In addition to talking about a learning plan that fits your needs, we will discuss how to execute that plan, including lab environments, as well as resources to help you execute those plans.  If you have reached this point, you simply need to be in this session, see you there.

## Title: Definitive Proof that Pluto is Indeed a Planet
 
**Abstract**:
Ever the one left out, Pluto's status as a key member of the solar system has been under scrutiny in recent years and the debate rages on.

In the age of AI, surely it's an easy problem to solve with computering. I'm sure Microsoft has a crack team of hackstars working on it right now. What toolset do you think they would use to do something like that? Probably some fancy cloud bricks or something.

Anyway, I'm sure this is possible. It has to be, we'd just need to learn about:

- A distributed analytics platfrom able to work with tons of raw planetary data
- An AI platform that is performant and allows a team of developers to collaborate and improve the product
- The ability to call the model billions and billions and billions and billions errr

I don't think this will take much longer than 75 mins. Might as well get to it.

(Psst: You're going to learn all about scalable data processing and web scale analytics using Azure Databricks, MLFlow, and Azure ML)

## Title: Revenge: The SQL!
 
**Abstract**:
Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?
Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 
This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * in ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!
Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.

## Title: Active Directory and Azure Active Directory: Authentication in a Cloudy World
 
**Abstract**:
If you're planning on deploying Office 365 or Azure, whether you know it or not, you will be using Azure Active Directory (AAD). But, you've already got on-prem Active Directory. How do these two products work together? Are they the same thing? SHOULD they work together? In this session I'll answer these questions, compare and contrast AD and AAD usage in Azure and hybrid scenarios, discuss costs, and some best practices.
This is a beginner session, but there will be some networking involved, in addition to "legacy" AD functionality and settings.

## Title: Learn History from Temporal Tables
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2016 came out with a bucket full of cool new features. One of them is Temporal Tables. SQL Server 2017 made some enhancements in this area. Temporal tables are basically history tables of the normal tables; that allows us to retrieve data from any point in time for every change such as updates and deletes. It does this all without any change to application code and without needing any triggers. In this session, we will see what the requirements of creating temporal tables are. We will see the demo on insert and update functionality and how to query historical information using new TSQL clause. We will touch upon retention of history as well. It has lots of demos and less theory.
