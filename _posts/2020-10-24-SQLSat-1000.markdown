##Title: The ins and outs of securing SQL Server traffic##
 
**Abstract**:
We are frequently hearing of an enterprise-size business being hacked, data being stolen, or data being exploited. Data security has always been important, but it should not be taken for granted. Data is information, and one of the greatest assets to a business, and when it is compromised, things go south quickly.

While there are multiple levels of security (securing data at rest, data in traffic, etc.), this session will focus on securing data that is on the move; ie., securing traffic between a client and server. We'll discuss and look at two solutions: Certificates and IPsec, exploring them in detail, outlining the pros and cons of each, how to set up and configure them, and when to use what.

##Title: Mental Health in IT: Safeguarding our most precious resource##
 
**Abstract**:
One in four Americans suffers from a mental health challenge each year. In the tech community, this number rises to 42%. The stigma associated with discussions around mental health, as well as how it can negatively impact your work and home life, make people reluctant to discuss the topic. Now is the time to start discussing mental health in tech and how to take advantage of the opportunity to safeguard our most precious resource: people. We'll discuss how mental health affects job quality, including sharing examples from my professional life. We'll discuss the four primary workplace factors which play a pivotal role in mental health challenges in the tech community. I'll provide tips on what is best to say and not say to people you know whose lives are being affected by their mental health. Lastly, we'll cover how to make your workplace a safe place where mental health can be talked about and how to encourage your company to offer resources to help maintain everyone's mental health.

##Title: 10 Cloudy Questions to Ask Before Migrating Your SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
Cloud adoption of database-related services continues to accelerate, but the choices for which service to select – IaaS, DBaaS, and PaaS – all impact the features available to your applications. Selecting a service is a critical first step in the migration process, and selecting poorly can lead to cost overruns and significant time spent going down the wrong path. The questions you do not ask or consider prior to a migration can make or break your cloud experience. The most important ten questions to answer, such as your availability requirements, database-level dependencies, migration strategies, and other critical concerns, will all be discussed so that you are ready to move to the cloud with confidence in your platform of choice.

##Title: Developing Cosmos DB for the Enterprise##
 
**Abstract**:
Azure Cosmos DB is an awesome multi-model database service that allows us to distribute our data on a global scale. It's fairly easy to get started with Cosmos DB, but when it comes to implementing it for use within our Enterprise applications, there are many things that you will want to consider when developing a Cosmos DB database.

In this session, I'll cover important topics that you'll want to consider when developing and administrating Cosmos DB for Enterprise use, including security considerations, partitioning, provisioning throughput for your databases and collections, distributing your data and much more.

By the end of this session, you should be able to take these learnings and apply them when developing Cosmos DB applications for your business.

##Title: 10 DBA Tasks for Azure SQL: Whats Different from On-Prem##
 
**Abstract**:
Adoption of Cloud is at an all time high, with no end in sight. Managing a small fleet of databases on-premises was something you used to understand. In this session, we'll cover the 10 most common tasks a DBA needs to learn to manage in Azure SQL as well as they currently manage their On Prem installs. One of the great things about Azure SQL is that the skill set your team has developed over the years translates well. The tools and technologies you're familiar with are all there. So much is the same but some of the tasks that DBAs do are different.  We'll familiarize everyone with ten of the tasks that are different including demo.

##Title: Build a Complete Azure Data Platform in 1 Hour##
 
**Abstract**:
Migrating Data and Analytic workloads to Azure gives organizations the ability to innovate faster with the Azure Data Platform. To unlock the potential, it typically takes months to architect, engineer, and deploy a Modern Data and Analytics Platform in Azure. Even with a prescriptive approach for cloud adoption, many organizations are not equipped to take on the full scope of responsibility required to leverage the all-up capabilities they have acquired as a result of the project.
Patrick Gallucci will share a service delivery approach that helps organizations move large and small data platforms to Azure. He will show you how to leverage proven cloud adoption methodologies, tools, resources, and best practices to enable your organization to simplify and accelerate their move to the cloud.

##Title: From Stutterer to Speaker: Overcoming Your Fears##
 
**Abstract**:
Are you terrified of public speaking? For 37 years of my life, I was too! That paralyzing fear of public communication held me back and kept me taking from taking advantage of career and community opportunities that came my way - and I've heard this story from many. Now, when I speak at community events, I'm often asked how I got into speaking and how I got over my fears of public speaking. In this free-wheeling session I'll tell you the tips and tricks that I took to heart to go from a kid in speech therapy to somebody that volunteers to speak in front of people and actually enjoys it. Most importantly, I'll talk about how improved personal and public communication can give your career a massive boost in this time of rapid growth in the data professional realm. I sincerely hope this session helps encourage people to overcome their fears of public and small group speaking - or that you at least enjoy making fun of pictures of 6-year-old me in speech therapy headphones!

##Title: Certification Exams Inside Out##
 
**Abstract**:
Preparing for Microsoft certification? Do you want insight into how certification exams are written, how questions are designed, and how to follow a logical process of elimination? We'll go through the process of item creation from an item writer's viewpoint, what rules item writers must follow, and why questions sometimes have strange phrasing. For any technical skillset pursuing certification, we'll review non-technical sample questions and walk through the process of using information at your disposal. You'll better understand how to deconstruct the problem statement. We'll leave time for QA with a veteran of the Microsoft certification exam writing process.

##Title: Execution plans ... where do I start?##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL (the language) is not a third generation language, where the developer tells the computer every step it needs to take. It is a declarative language that specifies the required results. SQL Server itself will figure out what steps it takes to get to those results. Most of the time, that works very well.

But sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes a query takes too much time. You need to find out why, so you can fix it. That’s where the execution plan comes in. In the execution plan, SQL Server exposes exactly which steps it took for your query, so you can see why it’s slow.

However, execution plans can be daunting to the uninitiated. Especially for complex queries. Where do you even start?

In this session you will learn how to obtain execution plans. and how to start reading and understanding them.

##Title: A Tour of Azure DevOps and TFS##
 
**Abstract**:
Learning how to orchestrate your software development process can be a challenge, and many people don't know where to start using the tools available. For Microsoft stack developers, Azure DevOps and TFS provide cloud and on-premises tooling to manage your code. 
In this session we will look at the integration of work tracking with Scrum templates and Kanban boards with version control for your code. We will discuss and demonstrate pull requests to help manage the flow of work within a team and explain the build, test, and release tools available for your database and application code. 

At the end of this session, attendees will be more comfortable getting started with their own project in Azure DevOps and using the tools with their own team.

##Title: Dynamic SQL: Writing Efficient Queries on the Fly##
 
**Abstract**:
Dynamic SQL is a powerful tool that allows for the creation of fast and efficient queries when the specifics may not be known until run-time. This tool can be used to automate complex processes, facilitate reporting on an unknown number of targets, or perform tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming to develop.

This is an often misunderstood tool that is underused in areas where it can provide immense value or abused by applications that it was never intended for. Well-written dynamic SQL can solve seemingly impossible problems while being easy to read and understand.

Applications that will be demonstrated include: mapping database relationships, schema searching, generating large volumes of TSQL, and much more. Explore the many uses for dynamic SQL as well as best practices for writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining it!

##Title: Basic Data Modeling for BI Reporting##
 
**Abstract**:
We all start using business intelligence tools by using a single dataset, like a flat file.  Then, we hit a plateau in our learning curve, or we add a second flat file into our BI product, and we get incorrect results.  One reason is that we haven't modeled our solution correctly.

In order to move to the next level of our journey along the BI learning curve, we need to understand how a tool like Power BI works.  Only then will we understand why we design our data models the way we do.

In this session, we will review how tools like Power BI work under the covers and how that impacts the way we construct our data models.  This is an introductory level course, so we will not get too technical, just enough to get us to the next level and moving back up that learning curve!

##Title: Notebooks 101 for SQL People##
 
**Abstract**:
Are you a database developer, a DBA or a data analyst? Do you find spending quite a bit of time trying to reproduce analysis or reproduce issues and the troubleshooting techniques? This Notebooks 101 session is for you!

The lack of rigor in being able to reproduce analysis in business context or to reproduce data troubleshooting can lead to confusion and time wasted on work that had been previously done. With Notebooks, Data Professionals can share their techniques and data sources used for the data analysis or troubleshooting for code review and reproducible insights/troubleshooting. 

Azure Data Studio Notebooks support SQL and KQL natively with intellisense; with easy to use charting capabilities. With Notebooks and Jupyter Book (collection of Notebooks) in Azure Data Studio, it’s also easy now for your team to build an onboarding guide (user manual) / documentation on data sources, useful sample scripts and tutorials.

##Title: Modern SQL Server CPU Architectures for Performance##
 
**Abstract**:
Modern CPU architectures are complex and misunderstood, especially as they relate to SQL Server instance configuration and database usage patterns. Default values in virtualization and the SQL Server instance can cause misalignments and improper balance in the way the SQL Server lines up with the CPUs and memory, which results in an immediate (and silent) performance penalty. Come learn as we discuss topics such as physical and virtual NUMA, hyperthreading, query parallelism, public cloud CPU selection, and SQL Server instance settings, and show you how to validate your SQL Server architecture and improve the performance of your critical SQL Servers for both on-prem and cloud-based SQL Servers.

##Title: SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters: Make SQL Server your Data Hub for everything##
 
**Abstract**:
In the realm of data storage and processing, there are two major technologies which we deal with every day. On one side, we have relational data that is stored inside SQL Server, and on the other side, non-relational or very large datasets that do not fit the relational model which are stored on big data clusters like Hadoop or Spark. 
This introduces challenges when having to combine datasets across both these technologies. SQL Server was never built to process huge datasets in a distributed fashion or to handle non-relational data very well, meaning that in many cases you would have to resort to bringing your relational data into Hadoop or Spark clusters. 
SQL Server 2019 has the answer with Big Data Clusters: it combines SQL Server with HDFS and Spark!

In this session we are going to explore the capabilities of the exciting new feature. How does it work and how can we work with datasets that are non-relational?

##Title: Proper Data Type Usage=Guaranteed Better Performance and Accuracy##
 
**Abstract**:
It’s an all too common occurrence to have table columns or variables that have been assigned less than ideal data types. 

In this demo-heavy presentation I will show you the importance of choosing the proper data type; show you some guidelines in determining what an appropriate data type would be; and once chosen, give you some tools for its usage and management. I will demonstrate several performance and accuracy issues, along with their possible solutions, caused by either the assignment of inappropriate data types or improper usage of them. In addition I will cover several data type related functions, and point out caveats in their usage. I expect even advanced T-SQL developers and DBAs to walk away with a useful nugget or two.

##Title: Every Millisecond Counts##
 
**Abstract**:
Query optimization is relatively easy when you look at a plan and find table scans, hash match joins, and missing indexes. But how do you find opportunities when all the low hanging fruit has been picked?
This session is a case study on improving a procedure that runs 350 million times per day, so any improvement is greatly magnified. We will discuss where we found opportunities to improve a procedure running in 3.1 milliseconds; how effective our attempts were, what didn't work, and the results achieved.

##Title: Jupyter Notebooks for DBAs##
 
**Abstract**:
Jupyter Notebooks were once the realm of Data Scientists. New releases of Azure Data Studio, Visual Studio Code, and .NET interactive tooling have brought this tooling into the Operational team's area. The biggest benefit of using Jupyter Notebooks is that you have your documentation, your code __and__ your results in the same source controllable document.

I will share with you all of the knowledge I have gained over the past 12 months implementing Jupyter Notebooks for Data Operation teams.

You will leave  
- with a good understanding of possible use cases for Jupyter Notebooks
- being comfortable in using the different tooling
- with many examples that you can take back to work and start being effective immediately

Enabling collaboration with your team, simplifying common tasks, improving Incident Wash-Up meetings, creating run-books, easily creating code for others to use are some of the benefits that you will take away. 
We will have fun as well.

##Title: Understanding NULLs in SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server follows three-valued logic (3VL) (instead of Boolean logic) to evaluate any condition to True or False or Unknown. Unknown value in SQL Server is represented as NULL. NULLs in SQL Server are often misunderstood and causes data inconsistency issues. In this session, we will try to go through different test cases to understand NULLs properly.

##Title: How to Troubleshoot a Slow Running Query in SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
You always wanted to troubleshoot a slow running query. But you just don’t know where to begin. In this demo-heavy session, I will show you how to troubleshoot a slow running query. You will see an end-to-end query tuning example with a slow running workload. We will capture important metrics while the workload is running and then use the captured data to troubleshoot query performance issues. The technique you will learn can be applied to production straight away. This will be a 100% demo session.

##Title: SELECT Questions FROM Diversity.Inclusion WHERE AfraidToAsk = 1##
 
**Abstract**:
In the past several years Diversity, Equity,  Inclusion (DEI) have become more important and visible in the workplace.  Studies have shown that organizations are often more successful when they are more diverse, yet the tech sector is moving slowly to improve representation and inclusion.  Many IT professionals want to improve but don't know where to start.  

This session will cover key concepts in DEI and how they apply to data practitioners.

**Abstract**:
We are going to examine a variety of oopsies MANY developers fall prey too - some obvious, some pretty subtle and some down right sneaky! Lots of code examples with the bad AND good code presented. I GUARANTEE that you will find things here that will either prevent you from getting bad data, throwing unwanted errors or vastly improving your database application's performance.  I have given this talk over 100 times now and it is always very highly rated!

##Title: Navigating Row Level Security##
 
**Abstract**:
New to SQL Server 2016 (okay, it's a few years old already, but it still feels new) is Row Level Security, which allows database developers and architects to effectively lock down tables, giving users access to a defined subset of data in the table.  It sounds easy enough, but there are a number of design considerations and pitfalls to be aware of.  This session will work through a few demos to implement RLS and dive into those pitfalls that need to be avoided.  For anyone considering implementing Row Level Security or have tried but have run into issues, this should be a session you want to attend.

##Title: Python: Turn your SQL ETL up to 11##
 
**Abstract**:
Almost everywhere you look in the data community you see Python being used (job-postings, Azure Services, AWS Service etc…). But what is Python, and why has it become such a popular tool for Data Professionals? During this discussion we will talk about what is Python, why is it being used so heavily, what benefits it provides, and what is in store for future uses of Python. There will be demos using Jupyter Notebooks doing data analysis, importing data into database (ETL), and light visualization.
