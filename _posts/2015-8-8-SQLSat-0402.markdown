## Title: Clustered Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2014
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2012 introduced columnstore indexing but with one major drawback -- columnstore indexes were not updateable.  Thus, adopting them to improve data warehousing (or other) query patterns took careful planning and quite a bit of management.  SQL Server 2014 introduces clustered columnstore indexes that are now fully updateable!  During this session, we'll take a look at how clustered columnstore indexes work, what implications exist for using them, and how the update process is handled.  We'll also take a look at what management and maintenance operations are required to keep clustered columnstore indexes performing optimally.  Anyone with a large data warehouse environment (or even an OLTP or ODS database with very large tables) will definitely want to attend!

## Title: CSI: DW -- Anatomy of a VLDW!
 
**Abstract**:
Put on your CSI caps as we delve into the anatomy of a Very Large Data Warehouse environment!  During this case study session, we'll take a look at the data warehouse environment at the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The VA is the largest healthcare organization in the US and has an extensive national DW and BI infrastructure, now in its seventh year of evolution.  We'll take a look at the database infrastructure, the data loading process, and the various reporting and analytics solutions that provide over 150,000 knowledge workers and report consumers with timely data and information.  We'll also take a look at some of the processes in place to support the myriad of extended reporting and analytics teams throughout the VA who build and manage second-tier downstream data marts and other reporting solutions.

## Title: How In-Memory Database Objects Affect Database Design
 
**Abstract**:
With SQL Server 2014, Microsoft has added a major new feature to help optimize OLTP database implementations by persisting your data primarily in RAM. Of course it isn't that simple, internally everything that uses this new feature is completely new. While the internals of this feature may be foreign to you, accessing the data that uses the structures very much resembles T-SQL as you already know it. As such, the first important question for the average developer will be how to adapt an existing application to make use of the technology to achieve enhanced performance. In this session, I will start with a normalized database, and adapt the logical and physical database model/implementation in several manners, performance testing the tables and code changes along the way.

## Title: Execution Plans for Mere Mortals
 
**Abstract**:
Abstract: As a beginner database professional, execution plans are intimidating. In this 1 hour session, I will take you through the basics of reading graphical execution plans and drill into key operators, warnings and properties.
Prerequisites: Basic understanding of T-SQL and the SQL Server Engine.
Sections:
•	You will understand how, why and when the execution plan will be created and saved to plan cache.
•	Reading the execution plan will be much less intimidating as you can talk through the flow and process of a graphical execution plan. 
•	After looking at the key operators you will be able to analyze the operators of your execution plans, the operator properties and identify common performance issues and tuning opportunities.
•	Finally, you will be able to capture the execution plan, save it for later analysis and comparison after modifications have occurred.

## Title: Getting Started With Execution Plans
 
**Abstract**:
Are you just breaking into the query tuning side of managing your SQL Servers?  In this session, we will cover the basics you need to start leveraging execution plans as part of your tuning process.  We will discuss how SQL Server creates and uses plans, and how to collect them.  Once we have the plans, we will go step-by-step through how to read them, and what the most common operators mean.  We will look at the different types of operators not just from a standpoint of what they do, but how they can impact query performance.  We will also cover how good database design and maintenance allow you to get better execution plans through having the right indexes and up-to-date statistics.

## Title: Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!
 
**Abstract**:
Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!

## Title: Right-Sizing Your SQL Server Virtual Machine
 
**Abstract**:
Virtualizing your top-tier production SQL Servers is not as easy as P2V’ing it. Sometimes allocating more resources to the VM is the wrong approach, and getting it wrong will silently hurt performance. What is the most effective method for determining the ‘right’ amount of resources to allocate? What happens if the workload changes a month from now?

The methods for understanding the performance of your mission-critical SQL Servers gathered over the past ten years of SQL Server virtualization will be addressed, and valuable processes for performance statistic collection and analysis will be displayed. Come learn how to properly ‘right-size’ the resources allocated to a VM, improve the performance of your SQL Servers, and keep it maximized well into the future.

## Title: Every Byte Counts: Why Your Data Type Choices Matter
 
**Abstract**:
Ever encounter a table consisting only of BIGINT, CHAR(255), and NVARCHAR(MAX) columns? Did your gut tell you that this is bad, but you had difficulty explaining why? Did you know that these data type choices can be a real performance killer? 

Attend this session to learn how database records are stored within SQL Server, and why all data types are not created equal. Armed with that knowledge, we will then explore several performance scenarios that may be impacting your systems right now! 

When you leave, you will be able to explain to your colleagues why data type choices matter, assess your own systems, and implement some best practices to mitigate these performance killers.

## Title: Picking the Right Fights with Your Server Team
 
**Abstract**:
Being a DBA is more challenging than ever—virtualized infrastructure, tiered storage and the cloud mean you may not know where you servers are, what disks your data is on, and you have less control than ever. In order to keep your databases performing and to provide an optimal environment you have to pick your battles. You have limited capital, and you only want to pick the most important fights.
In this session you will learn about how to choose battles and win (with data!):
•	How to configure storage and file systems for SQL Server
•	Why you should always compress your backups
•	How your virtual machines should be configured for SQL Server
•	What rights you and your servers need in Active Directory
•	Many more and more importantly—which battles NOT to fight
After attending this session, you will have a good understanding of how to talk with your peers in the infrastructure teams and make sure the key SQL Servers in your environment have the resources they need to perform great

## Title: Digging Out From Corruption
 
**Abstract**:
A "Disaster" doesn't need to be on a massive scale to cause widespread destruction in your enterprise. Simple things like failing hardware, strange storage bugs, a forgotten WHERE clause, or an angry employee can either cause devastation or be just a nuisance to the properly-prepared DBA. This session is a survey of recovery techniques that should be in every DBA's toolbox.

## Title: Flash  SQL Server— Re-Thinking Best Practices
 
**Abstract**:
Flash storage is a game changer for virtually every app in which it is used.  Whether used locally, for tiered storage, or all-flash arrays, flash is turning what we thought we knew about SQL Server best practices on its head.  Contemporary IT environments should standardize their architecture including a tier of flash.   Virtualized or non-virtualized, standardizing on in-server flash is vital for optimizing performance, scalability, efficiency (technical and cost), reliability,  availability.  Learn how flash flips the /faster bit  the significant impact flash makes not just in terms of performance, but also best practices,  the massive savings in licensing driven by consolidation on flash.

## Title: DQ What? DQ Who? DQ How?
 
**Abstract**:
Whether a company has 1 database containing 1GB of data or hundreds of databases containing terabytes or even petabytes of data, at some point they all have the same question..."What is the quality of our data?". A business runs off of it's data and if that data isn't complete, consistent, and accurate bad decision can be made. Come to this session and learn how to tell if your data is quality data worthy of making decision from. We'll learn what it means to have quality data and how you can measure the quality of your data using the Data Quality Services (DQS) component of SQL Server. Together we'll explore this lesser known part of SQL Server and learn how it works and how you can start using it to measure and improve the quality of your data and thus the decisions being made from it.

## Title: Hacking Expos#233; Too - Just How Transparent is TDE?
 
**Abstract**:
You have to be compliant, but can’t change source code, or SQL code. What’s your option? Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) of course! 
The real question though, is just how transparent is TDE?
In this, the second installment of the Hacking Expos#233; series, we will assume the role of a hacker once more and dig into our database and steal our backups and data files. We will then try to restore the files, and even dig into the files themselves and see what might be exposed.
We then go through the steps to lock down our data using TDE.
Once again we assume the role of a hacker and try to dig through the database, steal backups and data files and see just what is available to us.
*Warning - Do not try these demos at work without proper permissions as some actual hacking techniques are used.

## Title: Know Your Role(s)!
 
**Abstract**:
Developers and DBAs naturally conflict with each other over permissions since developers want to be able to fix their code and research issues, but DBAs are the gatekeepers.  In this session we will discuss Microsoft recommended best practices for setting up users and service account permissions.  We will go over common server and database roles and what they actually allow, including roles that should be avoided as potential security loopholes.  He will also look into alternatives for elevated database roles, and easier ways of setting up users across an enterprise environment, all as part of how to consolidate your development servers into fewer instances.  Serves as an introduction to default roles, explicit permissions, schemas, and security challenges for consolidated environments or database as a service.

## Title: Infrastructure level In Memory Computing
 
**Abstract**:
I/O performance and operational ease of use are key requirements for SQL Server deployments. While virtualization has delivered operational ease of use it has done so at the expense of I/O performance. This has resulted in excessive database tuning or expensive and disruptive infrastructure changes to alleviate the I/O bottlenecks. Database level In-Memory Computing while promising brings with it a slew of challenges including application rewrites. 

What if one could guarantee In-Memory performance for SQL Server without any of the challenges that contemporary approaches incur? In this  presentation Bala Narasimhan will introduce 'Infrastructure level In Memory Computing' as a bullet proof way of providing RAM performance for SQL Server without any side effects, any application rewrites or changes to infrastructure.

## Title: Data Architecture 101
 
**Abstract**:
This presentation is a quick introduction for the DBA or developer who was just told that their boss promised a major new customer a scalable, well designed database. The customer will pay a lot of cash and years of ongoing business using this database… If you deliver it this week!

You’ll get a big bonus if you build this right, but you also remember what your co-workers did to the person who bungled the last database design… and wonder if that designer ever recovered! This session will introduce you to the fundamentals of Datatypes, Relational Algebra, and Normalization to help you avoid the major pitfalls and maybe get some sleep too!

you see a database marked SUSPECT, or RECOVERY PENDING. What do you do? In this session
we'll cover the various states that a database can be in, how they get into those states, and 
learn the proper techniques to bring your data safely back online.

## Title: What's New in SQL Server 2014 OTHER THAN Hekaton?
 
**Abstract**:
When asked about new features in the SQL Server 2014 Database Engine, people tend to only think of one thing: In-Memory OLTP, commonly known by its code-name "Hekaton." While In-Memory OLTP is a great improvement, many other features may prove more helpful for day-to-day database activity. This session will investigate the other new features offered in 2014, including delayed durability, buffer pool extension, enhancements to backups, partitioning, statistics, columnstore indexes, security, and much more!
