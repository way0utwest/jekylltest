##Title: Being the Swiss Army Knife of DB Pros##
 
**Abstract**:
Being a specialist means you're really, really good at one thing. Being a generalist means you're good at a a lot of different things. The generalist has an advantage over the specialist because he or she can see and solve problems the specialists can't. In this session I'll cover why it's important to diversify your skill set, not only for career protection, but to be better as a database professional. We'll look at what skill sets to build on to expand your abilities around SQL Server to include the operating system, development, networks, and security. Remember, this saying isn't complete, "Jack of all trades, master of none." The full saying is, "Jack of all trades, master of none, though often times better than master of one."

##Title: SQL Server 2012 Columnstore index##
 
**Abstract**:
It might seem far-fetched that a company would upgrade to SQL Server 2012 “just” for a database index.  But after you see the performance enhancements gained from the new columnstore index in SQL Server 2012, you’ll see why many are calling this one of the most important features in the history of SQL Server.  In this presentation, I’ll talk about the physical aspects of  columnstore index in SQL Server 2012, how to create it, and what environments  (mainly data warehousing environments) and queries can make use of it.  I’ll show performance benchmarks between columnstore indexes in SQL Server 2012, and compare them to index strategies prior to SQL Server 2012.  I'll also show how the new Batch execution mode can improve performance as well.  Time permitting, I'll also talk about the new enhancements in SQL 2014.

##Title: Never Have to Say "Mayday!!!" Again##
 
**Abstract**:
December 1978: 10 people die in a commercial airliner. Why? Bad troubleshooting skills and poor maintenance – disaster-causing attitudes. As you'll learn in this session, the doomed airliner ran out of fuel while the crew of three wasted time troubleshooting a false alarm. We can draw some parallels in the database world. Poor troubleshooting, disaster-causing attitudes, and a lack of disaster preparedness lead to needless downtime and serious user impact across our environments. 

In this session, we'll look at case studies of real-life aviation disasters and production database downtime incidents. We'll see similarities in attitudes that cause disasters. Come learn about the importance of preparation, troubleshooting, and teamwork. This will be an interactive session where we’ll pick apart disasters, engage in discussion around case studies, and leave prepared to change attitudes in ourselves and our colleagues and avoid disasters at work.

##Title: Data Warehouse ETL Rollback with SSIS 2012##
 
**Abstract**:
Loading a data warehouse can be fraught with data quality issues, data type mismatches, and failed loads. To combat these issues and load your data quickly can be a challenge.  This session will explain step-by-step how to implement an ETL rollback framework to remove any data that was loaded incorrectly.  Based on a real-world implementation, this framework can either automatically or manually load the corrected data, making your life easier.

##Title: Using Compression to Improve Database Performance##
 
**Abstract**:
Back in the old days, compression and databases was a really bad idea. Now, with powerful CPUs we can use to both improve performance and save disk space. We will cover the basics of how all compression and deduplication works, and then we will learn how SQL Server page and row compression work, and the special compression that is used in SQL 2012 Columnstore Indexes. We will demo performance and space savings in using compression.

##Title: SQL Server Dos and Don'ts: Keys to DBA Nirvana##
 
**Abstract**:
Bad Windows builds? No HA? No backups? SQL Server considered the non-mission critical platform yet you have hundreds of instances? Over the years I've seen most, if not all of, the good, bad, and ugly of being a SQL Server DBA from being both a full time employee as well as a consultant. If you want to skip 20 years of ups and downs, come to this session to hear how you can be a better DBA for your SQL Server deployments, avoid pitfalls, and hopefully laugh at a few of my misadventures over the course of my career.

##Title: It is TEMPDB, Why Should You Care?##
 
**Abstract**:
TEMPDB is just for temporary data right? It is installed by default and gets recreated it time SQL is restarted so what does it matter right? WRONG. This session will give you great insight into what uses TEMPDB, why TEMPDB is important, what are some best practices for configuring TEMPDB, and how to determine if you have contention. If you have systems where TEMPDB hasn't been touched since the install, you need to attend this session.

##Title: Policy-Based Management and Central Management Server ##
 
**Abstract**:
Two of the most highly underutilized features of SQL Server are Policy-Based Management (PBM) and Central Management Server (CMS). PBM allows you to administer and control your SQL Server environment in a way that was very difficult or even impossible beforehand.  Simply put PBM lets you define rules or policies to govern your SQL Server enterprise. CMS among other things allows you to organize and manage your instances in groups that you define from a single point. Come see how these two features can add a whole new level of manageability and reduce the time you spend achieving your management goals.

##Title: Crazy Things That Developers Do, Part I##
 
**Abstract**:
Throughout my career, I've seen developers do some pretty crazy things to databases (and truth be told, I've done some of these myself!). Come to this 2 part session to learn what we do, why it's bad to the database server... and alternatives that can be used instead. Trust me... your DBA will love you for making these changes.

##Title: Change Data Capture  Change Tracking Deep Dive##
 
**Abstract**:
Change Data Capture (CDC) and Change Tracking (CT) have been standard features in SQL Server for a few years now but there's not really that much useful information out in the blogosphere about how they work under the hood. Kevin Hazzard will dig deep into the implementations of CDC and CT in SQL Server 2012, showing you all of the parameters you can use to make these great features serve your organization well. This will be a highly-interactive, highly-entertaining session with lots of questions answered and mysteries revealed.

##Title: Tune Queries By Fixing Bad Parameter Sniffing ##
 
**Abstract**:
Parameter sniffing is a misunderstood issue on SQL Server. Most of the time, parameter sniffing is helping performance on your servers. But sometimes, circumstances change, and what was helping you is now hurting you – bad. In this session, we’ll gain an understanding of what exactly parameter sniffing is and why it’s usually so helpful. Then we’ll explore how parameter sniffing can go wrong and look at seven different ways you can deal with it when it does. You’ll take away a wealth of knowledge that will help you identify and resolve bad parameter sniffing in your own environment.

##Title: Making Predictions with Microsoft Data Mining Tools##
 
**Abstract**:
Whether predicting customers or All Stars, the process and the tools remain the same.  Microsoft’s Analysis Services Data Mining tools enable you to quickly profile your data, identify hidden relationships and predict future outcomes based on those relationships.   Join me to see what data mining is, what data mining is not and how Microsoft's data mining tools can help you analyze your business.  During this session, I will walk us through a start-to-finish data mining prediction project.  It's easier than you might have thought.
