## Title: Business Continuity: The Real Reason for HA and DR
 
**Abstract**:
These days, I've stopped counting how many times I've been approached to help implement feature X because a customer thinks/was told it provides 24x7 for a DB/instance. These decisions often lead to more downtime and less uptme if the technology choice was not right or cannot be administered by the current staff. The secret sauce is not what gets implemented but understanding everything behind the scenes that influences the final architecture based on your actual requirements. It’s less about technology and more about understanding what it will take to keep your business going even when things seems like they are crumbling down around you. This session will cover how to approach achieving business continuity with the right amount of uptime.

## Title: Building Your First Tabular Model
 
**Abstract**:
With the release of SSAS 2012 Microsoft has introduced a new BI storage engine. In addition to the traditional OLAP engine you now have the option to build your BI models on top of the new Vertipaq engine. To use the new Vertipaq engine you build a Tabular data model.  A new query language DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is used to query the data, create calculations, measures, and KPI’s.This session is designed to introduce you to the process of building a tabular model in SQL Server Data Tools (BIDS rebranded). We will import data from a SQL Server relational database into a tabular model project and create relationships between the tables. We will use DAX to create and manage calculations, measures, and Key Performance Indicators

## Title: Dive into the Query Optimizer-Undocumented Insight
 
**Abstract**:
This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.

## Title: Database design for mere developers
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2012: Efficient and effective database design is so important that leaving it solely to the DBAs is simply not a solution. We as developers will more than likely have to create applications to access the data stores and as such must ensure that all application related considerations are taken into account within the database design.In this session, (aimed at software developers) we shall be touching upon several concepts of special importance to the developer. These include database development "patterns and anti-patterns", final proofing of design and creating versatile deployment scripts that can and will be utilized in future endeavors.

## Title: Taking BI to the Next Level: Collaboration
 
**Abstract**:
Self-service BI is usually an independent activity. But when individuals discover interesting information that they want to share, they need a centralized location to do that. When people work together, new insights are possible, and that’s what collaboration is all about. As more people see the benefits of the solution, they become more likely to use it. As individual products, SQL Server 2008 R2, SharePoint 2010, and Excel 2010 expand your options for enabling BI in your organization, but collectively they create a solid platform for collaborative BI. Knowing which tool to use for which job can be tricky. Come to this session to learn how to use these tools to foster collaboration.
