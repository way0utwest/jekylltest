## Title: Collecting Performance Metrics
 
**Abstract**:
Ever had a manager standing over your shoulder, wanting to know why an instance is running slow or if it can handle additional workload? What information would you use to answer these questions? If only you knew what performance metrics to collect and had them for your existing instances to answer these questions. 

In this session, we will be combining three open source tools - Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana - into an inexpensive system that collects performance metrics you can use to troubleshoot issues and answer important questions about your SQL Server instances, including your Linux SQL Server instances. We will learn what metrics to collect, how to use the tools to collect performance metrics and then we'll put it all together in an interactive dashboard for easy visualization.

## Title: Getting started with SQL Azure Database: What you need to know
 
**Abstract**:
Azure SQL Database offers a way quickly spin up new databases with minimal management requirements. However, the number of differences between on-premises SQL Server and Azure SQL Database can be overwhelming. Even worse, with DBaaS it’s not clear who is responsible for what anymore.
In this session, we will cover all the basic steps of getting your first Azure SQL Database instance spun up. We’ll cover common gotchas, like firewall settings and resource locks. We’ll also dive into some more advanced options with templates, allowing you to make your processes reproducible.
By the end of this presentation, you’ll understand if Azure SQL Database is the right choice for you and your needs. You’ll understand how it can simplify management and allow you to scale easily. Finally, you’ll have the confidence to go and create your own instance with ease.

## Title: DevOps: Consistent Deployments / Team Development
 
**Abstract**:
Unless you are developing code by yourself, you face challenges of working with several team members. Different people are changing code which affects the code someone else is working on. In addition, there will be teams working on different projects at the same time.  In the middle of the projects, an emergency fix needs to be deployed to Production. So where is the code, when do you shared it with others, when do you get the code that has been shared, where is the production code branch located.  How do I branch and when do merge? How do I get a release branch? Let me share with you how we are handling this area of DevOps.

## Title: The Ultimate Maintenance Plan
 
**Abstract**:
Is your SQL Server running slower and slower? Do you prefer a proactive rather than a reactive approach to managing SQL Server? Do you worry about being able to recover in an emergency? If you answer yes to any of the above this session is for you. 

We will start by exploring some of the maintenance options that are available. We will then explore the popular utility program by Ola Hallengren and how to implement. Next, we will explore the other areas of SQL Server that need to be maintained like history tables in MSDB. Finally, we will explore the different options when maintenance windows are tight. 

At the end of this session you will be able to: (1) Choose a maintenance program for your SQL Servers; (2) Program and schedule the maintenance programs; (3) Ensure that the SQL Server is running at optimum performance each day.

## Title: SQL Server Then and Now: Changing the State of Long-held Beliefs
 
**Abstract**:
We’ve all heard the rules for SQL Server like separate your data from your log, watch for a disk queue length over 2, and a low Page Life Expectancy always means memory pressure. All of these used to be true, but on today’s hardware and SQL Server versions – they are dangerously outdated. In this session, we will take on a bunch of these old “givens” of SQL Server that everybody has heard and followed, the underlying technological reasons they were true then, how today’s technology has rendered them obsolete, and what the new rules are that you need to know. So whether you are one of the old guard looking to refresh your set of working SQL Server rules or a member of the up-and-comers looking for the facts to win over the old guard, this session is for you.

## Title: Index Trek
 
**Abstract**:
When learning something new, it’s helpful to have a foundation.  Yet, indexes are often taught with only one or two sentences of explanation before CREATE INDEX.  I recall a student, exasperated by the textbook definition saying, “Will someone just SHOW ME an index!”  The goal of this high level presentation is to do just that.  In this 50 minute mission, we’ll explore nonclustered and clustered indexes as well as the strange new world of columnstore indexes.  Rather than focus on space and time requirements of indexes and index maintenance, we’ll seek out new understanding:

•	Why well-designed indexes speed up queries.
•	Why queries must be engineered carefully to use indexes.
•	Why indexes have both benefits and drawbacks.

After the mission, you’ll be prepared to further explore the galaxy of indexes.

## Title: Introduction to the R Programming Language for BI Professionals
 
**Abstract**:
The modern BI professional is taking on the challenge of operationalizing data science. Most BI developers are very strong in TSQL but their exposer to advanced statistics and visualizations were limited by what is available in the TSQL language. The R programming language allows us to clean, visualize, and apply advanced statistical methods to data. 

In this session I will demonstrate how to use R Studio to generate and test R scripts; generate R visuals in PowerBI; call R code in machine learning workflows; and execute R code in SQL Server. Additionally, I will cover these R programming fundamentals: creating and assigning variables; performing simple calculations; understanding R data types; vectors; matrices; factors; lists; data frames; and ggplot2 graphics.

## Title: Custom Auditing in SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
In order to effectively monitor SSIS performance, troubleshoot errors and understand the data linage in the production environment one needs to implement the package logging and Data auditing. SSIS already contains an Audit Transformation Component that captures information about the package metadata and the environment in which the package runs.

However, what if you encountered an error, or a package failure?  Suppose, a Data warehouse developer is performing an ETL to load a Dimension of a Data mart and would like to track the Data being processed. Audit Transformation Component cannot perform the job effectively.

So lets have an insight of how Auditing can be done by designing an SSIS  package that captures the Error information, DML operation on the table (Inserts/Updates/Deletes) along with the package metadata.

We'll create a package with an event handler that loads Data from a Staging to Dimension and creates an Audit table to track information on Data processing.

## Title: Getting your Database off to a Right Start
 
**Abstract**:
When you create a new database do you ensure you have done everything you can to give it the chance to shine when things get tough? How many times have you seen a database created with all the defaults and down the road it becomes out of control due to the size, amount of data or even activity? If you really want to ensure your database can scale and perform well at all times you need to do the proper homework before you create the database. We will walk thru the various factors that affect performance and scalability under real life conditions and help you understand how to properly configure them up front to avoid issues down the road. Scalability is all about having a proper foundation to build on.

## Title: Applying Data Warehousing Principles
 
**Abstract**:
Many data analysts typically begin to work with data as a single flat table. While this works for small datasets, as the size of the data grows these naive methods do not scale. Processing records takes longer, queries become more complex, and introducing new datasets is inconsistent at best. In order to solve these problems, we must take into account the underlying architecture of our data and how it should be modeled. During this talk we will discuss key concepts, patterns, and techniques for designing a data model that is simple to query, scales with your data, and is extendable to new datasets.
