## Title: SQL Server Reporting Services 2014 on Steroids!!
 
**Abstract**:
Reporting requests that are required ‘yesterday or sooner’, oft times necessitate working more efficiently and effectively. We have all been through this at one time or another.
In this hands on presentation we shall be looking some of the more challenging techniques of extracting our data from our Multidimensional and Tabular Models, in addition to our Data Mining Models. 
We shall be utilizing concepts of  ‘Openquery()’ and ‘linked servers’ as a means to extract data,  in addition to looking at the way that these two concepts can help us extract our data utilizing MDX, DMX and DAX expressions;  AND YET maintain the  flexibility and the ability to utilize all those wonderful techniques that may  be done with T-SQL.

## Title: RC, SI, and RCSI, Oh My! –We're off to see the Wizard -to understand how it all works.
 
**Abstract**:
I'm just going to say it straight out. I'm pessimistically optimistic that most really understand transaction concurrency in SQL Server. There is often significant confusion about transaction concurrency and contention options available to Developers -is it 'pessimistic', or 'optimistic', or in between? Everyone ‘sort of’ understands READ COMMITTED (RC). But do you sometimes feel 'dirty' as you attempt to 'repeatedly' read that phantasma? In order to reduce locking and blocking conflicts, some folks adopt SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (SI). And a few hardy stalwarts have ventured into the new world of READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (RCSI). In this session, we will explore the differences between the three, including a discussion about the positives and negatives of each option. We will discuss the effects of 'Dirty', 'Repeatable' and 'Phantom' reads, and why you may want to know which may be buried in your code. There will be code examples demonstrating the benefits and traps of each option.

## Title: Life saver - Resource Governor for applications  reporting
 
**Abstract**:
This critical situation still exists in many live production environments in various organizations. This quick Life Saver techniques will quickly enable you to provide prompt solution as a patch with Resource Governor features. This helps to manage memory, cpu resources and enables various applications  reporting to perform better by creating resource pools and allocating the memory for various groups, users, databases, applications. Also this session answers below questions.

What does Resource Governor do? What is a resource Pool? Why any basic/intermediate users are given caution before implementing Resource Governor? What is this capable of doing in terms of allocating resources to the users, databases and applications? What are the methods to implement Resource Governor  how to monitor the resource pools in terms of GUI  T-SQL?

You can take away working scripts, functions, tools to make a Resource Governor work and manage them.

## Title: A practical guide to Windows Azure SQL Database for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
What is "Windows Azure SQL Database" all about ? What does this mean for me as a DBA ? What is the process for setting up a Windows Azure database ? How would I go about migrating one of my databases to "The Cloud" ? How do I possibly leverage this new technology in my production environment ? 
If you are a production DBA and have contemplated one or more of these questions, this session is for you! Maybe, you have been tasked with finding out about "The Cloud". Join me in exploring the cloud where I will show you how SQL Server works in the Windows Azure SQL Database world. We will run through the simple process of configuring a Windows Azure SQL database.

## Title: Complex Event Processing with Azure Stream Analytics
 
**Abstract**:
Azure Stream Analytics targets complex event streams (CEP’s) to deduce meaningful patterns. Most of the typical use cases for this product is when various devices and sensors are sending data for further processing.

This technology uses a T-SQL like syntax to express its intents. A language that most data-power users will be familiar with.

The biggest advantage of Stream Analytics is when events are being published to the Stream Analytics, the only thing that event publishers needs to know is which Event Bus or Blob storage to place the data. Stream Analytics will then fetch the data.

This talk is about the main concepts and solution architecture when using Azure Stream Analytics, and also how to use this technology together with MS SQL Server, Azure SQL Database and Power BI.

What is regular Power BI look like? And what about connecting this to the cloud service/on-premise/hybrid with structured, semi, unstructured data in Haddop with statistical analysis using Machine Learning. It is really mind blowing to have one analytical tool to visualized data against various  different types of data sources.

This session helps you to explore the possibilities of how far latest Power BI  Azure lets you to stretch to visualize the future.

## Title: tSQLt - Database Unit Testing
 
**Abstract**:
Everyone writes perfect SQL code, but sometimes things happen that make your code run in weird and unexpected ways.
Or you are that lucky person that has to make changes to business critical code, where a mistake can put you on a fist name basis with the CEO.

Sure, we have testing departments that will check our code, and some of us have to test our code ourselves. 
But you might still end up lying awake at night wondering about that edge case scenario.

Testing takes time, and database tables have foreign keys and constraints and all sorts of other things that make it hard to get the system into a specific state. Then you change your code and have to do it all over again.

tSQLt allows you to prepare your database for a test, and once the test is run the database is set back like nothing happened. All that remains is whether your test succeeded.

We will go through setting up the framework, how to write tests and run them - either manually or as part of your build process

## Title: Backups? What backups?
 
**Abstract**:
That’s never something you want to hear. Unfortunately it tends to be heard far too often.
In this introductory session, we’ll look at backups, backups and more backups (because there’s no such thing as too many backups)

We’ll look at full backups, what they are and how often they should be run.
We’ll look at differential backups, how they fit into backup strategies and the pitfalls you may encounter when using them.
We’ll look at transaction log backups, at why they are an essential part of the backup strategy for important databases and at what happens when transaction log backups go wrong.

## Title: Real World Error Handling in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Every SQL developers should by now be aware of the new error handling introduced in SQL Server 2005, i.e. BEGIN TRY ... END TRY BEGIN CATCH ... END CATCH, and all of us are most likely extremely happy that we finally have "proper" error handling. 
However, in the "real world" it may not be so straight forward as just using this new error handling. As we at Derivco have seen there are quite a few "gotchas" when it comes to  how to handle errors. In this session we will take a look and see what issues we have to be aware of, in order not to be bitten by our error handling.

**Abstract**:
Next version of SQL Server is just "around the corner". In this session we will look at what a SQL Server developer may find interesting among a "sea" of new features / functionality.

Things we will look at is:  improvements to In-Memory OLTP (the "artist" formerly known as Hekaton),  Operational Analysis - how to combine OLTP processes together with the ability to analyse the data at the same time, new JSON support and other odd and "sundry" things

## Title: They said Select * was bad but...
 
**Abstract**:
So speaking to any smart database people they will generally tell you that the SELECT * FROM ... is a bad idea and should not be used. In this session we'll see some reason why this specifically focused on using them in views. Including an example of where this could go extremely wrong in the real world

## Title: Dynamic SQL, not so scary?
 
**Abstract**:
A look at how dynamic SQL can be used in BAU tasks as a tool and also its use in applications.

I will be looking at the specific example of an application runtime need to import all or a subset of database objects tables, views, functions, procedures, triggers from one database to another.

I will also look at how to store the result of a SQL select into a .NET Data Table object and then to XML and then the reverse of picking up the XML and then recreating the dataset back to SQL.
