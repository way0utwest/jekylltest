## Title: Accelerating SQL with Solid State Technology
 
**Abstract**:
Solid-state technologies are changing the way that MS SQL users run their databases. DBA’s are achieving significant TCO savings through performance enhancements, reliability improvements, and reduced energy and real estate costs using solid-state technologies.  Solid state is changing the way datacenters look and how MS SQL Servers perform.

This session will address:

1)	On overview of solid state technology options for SQL Server
2)	Why solid state makes a difference?
3)	An comparison of the different types of NAND Flash-based products and the advantages and disadvantages of each:
a.	Disk-based SSDs
b.	Onboard/Embedded PCI Express devices
c.	Host-based PCI Express devices
4)	Customer proof: Wine.com case study

## Title: SQL and SEO - Database Design and Web Marketing
 
**Abstract**:
Bringing marketing together with technology is a fine art that involves high tech tools, real life solutions, and most important human buy-in from the marketing and IT departments.  This lecture will delve into the use of the latest SQL Server 2005 and SQL Server 2008 technologies including recursive common table expressions (CTE), hierarchical data models, and CLR stored procedures for the IT side of the house while also delving into the use of analytics, webmaster monitoring tools, web marketing tactics and search engine optimization techniques for the more marketing minded.

Neither SQL nor SEO are four letter words and they go together perfectly!  So too can your IT and marketing departments as you tackle the new age of IT Marketing.
