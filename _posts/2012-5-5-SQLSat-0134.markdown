##Title: SQL Server Internals:  It's What's for Dinner!##
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wondered what happens under the hood when you query your SQL Server database? Well, it’s somewhat like asking for a special meal for dinner. During this session, I will use a cooking analogy to describe the life cycle of a query and the journey it takes through SQL Server’s working parts. By comparing the concepts of SQL Internals to a familiar idea, you will have a clear understanding of the underlying processes involved in returning data from a SELECT query. Once we’ve established a frame of reference for a simple read operation, we’ll look at an UPDATE statement and consider the additional factors associated with a write operation.  By session's end you should have a clear overview of what happens when a query hits your server.

Working on SQL for a long time, started on V6.5.

##Title: PowerPivot with NASA data##
 
**Abstract**:
Power Pivot is an amazing tool for mashing up data from a variety of sources ~ in this session, we will combine data from NASA, OpenGOV, and other publicly available sources, as well as from a prebuilt cube, to show the power of user driven analysis, and visualisation in Excel.
Using DAX, you will see how to create time-intelligence driven visualisations, and then dive into the new enhancements for the date table, relationshios, perspectives and KPIs.
As an added bonus, you will see how to pull the model into Visual Studio, decorate it with new attributes, and show the visualisations in other tools such as Performance Point and Crescent (PowerView)

##Title: Bad plan! Sit!##
 
**Abstract**:
Bad execution plans are the bane of database performance everywhere they crop up. But what is a bad execution plan? How do you identify one in your system and, once identified how do you go about fixing it?

In this session we’ll look at some things that make a plan ‘bad’, how you might detect such plans and various methods of fixing the problem, both immediately and long-term.

##Title: Data has "R" value##
 
**Abstract**:
Many companies take data for granted, and see it as a liability instead of an asset. In this session we will discuss some of the elements of how you can start to measure the “cost” of your data and if that data was lost what would it cost the company to recover. Your companies data must be a measurable asset.

I am a Specialist SharePoint Consultant at Mint Management Technologies South Africa, and have been in the industry for about 10 years.
I have been dabbling in the dark and mystical art of SharePoint for many a year and have learnt many tips and tricks, Do#39;s and Do not#39;s!!
I enjoy new tech toys and anything radio controlled especially monster trucks  and quad copters.

I have over 29 years in the world of RDBMS.  I have in-depth knowledge of Microsoft SQL Server and the Azure platform (Data Factories, Logic Apps, Functions,Event Grids...) .  I am fiercely passionate about my work.

I am currently developing a new Azure ecosystem for Penguin Random House. This includes moving load processes to Azure Logic Apps and Data Factory pipelines, leveraging Azure Functions, and pushing the new SQL Services to the limit. 

I am the creator of the Enhanced Threading Framework (ETF) for SSIS.  I presented at PASS 2013 on advanced SSIS techniques:  http://www.sqlpass.org/summit/2013/Sessions/SessionDetails.aspx?sid=4845
and was awarded '2009 Exceptional DBA of the Year', by RedGate and my peers.
