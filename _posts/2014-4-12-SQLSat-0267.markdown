## Title: SQL Server and XML Query
 
**Abstract**:
XML was added to the collection of SQL Server native data types in SQL Server 2005. Being a complex data type, not only is XML accompanied by a set of dedicated T-SQL functions, but also with a complete querying language. In this session you will learn about the Microsoft SQL Server 2008 implementation of the World Wide Web Consortium's XML Query Recommendation, and learn how to compose XML data – from existing SQL Server data or simply "from scratch", how to retrieve (relational) data from XML Documents to be used in a SQL Server database, and how to manipulate XML data using Transact-SQL and the XML Data Manipulation Language (XML DML). You've already mastered all the primitive SQL Server data types, why would XML be an exception?

## Title: Analytical Data Mining - Using Data Mining to Understand Data
 
**Abstract**:
Data mining is a technique used to derive previously unknown information from large amounts of data. The process of this knowledge discovery can help uncover new patterns within data and help analysts better understand the large datasets. Additionally, once these patterns have been defined, you can use them as part of predictive modelling estimating the likelihood of some event occurring.

SQL Server Analysis Services includes a data mining engine that can be used at various levels within an organization, from analyst to developer. This session will look at data mining as tool for data investigation by the business analyst.  We examine the business case, requirements and outcomes of data mining so that it can enhance our understanding of datasets. We will look at both simple and complex implementations of data mining that allow new information to be extracted from data and used in novel ways within the MS Stack.

## Title: Handling Errors and Data Anomalies in SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
Even in the most reliable ETL system, it's eventually going to happen: A package will fail, an output row count won't match what is expected, a data anomaly will force a forensic search of the package infrastructure... In this session, we'll talk about some of the things that can go wrong during package execution - and some of the defenses that can be built into SSIS to help head off those errors (or at least make the errors easier to troubleshoot). From error handlers to package restartability, and from logging methods to row count validation and remediation, we'll cover various ways to keep your ETL flowing when problems arise.

## Title: MDX, it is not that hard!
 
**Abstract**:
My first experience with MDX was: good, it looks like SQL: SELECT .. FROM .. WHERE. On my second glance it turned out to be completely different than SQL. But after a while SQL and MDX started to feel similar. In this session I bring you to the point of seeing the similarities instead of the differences. We will use your SQL experience to give you a head start with MDX. The session is also good for those with a bit of experience who want to know a bit more about the background. Of course all theory is backed by demo’s.
