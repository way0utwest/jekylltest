## Title: BI For (Almost) Everyone
 
**Abstract**:
Business Intelligence was for a long time considered something only the "big" companies could do or afford. However in the recent past with shifts in technology paradigms, BI has become a commodity affordable by many. You too can do BI if you have the right edition (and version) of SQL Server.
This session will showcase how data in an OLTP database can be converted into BI-worthy data: using the SQL Server 2012 Database Engine, Analysis Services and finally visualizing with Excel; along with references to SSIS, SSRS, PowerPivot and PowerView on the way.
