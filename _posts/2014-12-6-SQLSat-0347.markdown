## Title: Performance Tuning Pit Stop for DBAs
 
**Abstract**:
Our users are in constant demand of faster running servers that spill out data before they can blink. Performance can be hard to measure and improve.  Before we get in the race we will cover how to get a Performance baseline using the PAL Tools. The first Pit Stop will be to review TempDB setup to improve performance. Before getting into high gear we'll pull over to refuel on some Log File best practices and performance implications of VLFs. Finally before passing the checkered flag we'll make one more stop to talk about Data Files and improving your mileage from there. After this session you'll have a good idea of how to make changes transparent to any application to get your server crossing that finish line in style!

## Title: Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2014: Flipping the DW /Faster Bit
 
**Abstract**:
Columnstore indexes were introduced in SQL Server 2012  have been wholly re-architected  optimized in SQL Server 2014.  Columnstore indexes are optimized for data warehouse workloads  are a hybrid technology leveraging the best of off-disk  in-memory capabilities. Transparent to the app, columnstore has been shown to render queries at subsecond response times which heretofore took many minutes or longer. This presentation includes an overview of SQL Server 2012  a deep dive into SQL Server 2014 columnstore indexes, including a review of the architecture, as well as the challenges, workarounds, travails,  big wins at customer sites  inside MSIT. The presentation is rich in demos, including leveraging IaaS—Columnstore in The Cloud.  Learn whether columnstore can change your users' world  why columnstore may be a compelling reason to upgrade. Learn how columnstore indexes flip the DW faster bit  why columnstore manifests my motto, “Change the world or go home!”

## Title: Performance Tuning - Analyzing Execution Plans
 
**Abstract**:
Did you ever get woken up at night from a call from a user screaming about poor query performance, but didn’t really know how to begin attack the problem?  In this session, we will explore the basics of execution plan analysis and how to single out issues that pertain to base table operations.
In this presentation, we will identify what indexes are being used by the SQL Optimizer, the different type of index operations that are performed by SQL Server and which operations are generally considered the preferred method of data retrieval. We will discuss how to determine if the indexes used by the Optimizer are optimal, according to best practices, and the exceptions to those cases.   Finally, we will cover the relationships between different types of index operations and joins within SQL Server, including how the SQL Optimizer determines which join type it will use, along with the pros and cons of each join operation

## Title: SSIS Data Flow Engine: Under the Hood
 
**Abstract**:
A data flow task moves data from point A to point B, but how does it work behind the scenes? Understanding the internals of data flow engine can help you make correct package design choices in the first place and identify issues when your data loads run forever.

Using simple analogies, you'll see how data flow engine moves data through each component, uses buffers, builds execution trees, and transforms data in the pipeline. Along the way, you'll learn corresponding options and tips that make your packages run as fast as possible. This demo-filled session is for SSIS developers who're comfortable with creating packages but not so comfortable figuring out why data flow is slow and when or how to parallelize the data flows. Open the hood, you need to know how data flow engine works to make it 
work for you in an efficient and optimal way.

## Title: Dealing With Errors in SSIS 2012 
 
**Abstract**:
Errors can occur anywhere within an SSIS package and the cause and error message can be somewhat cryptic. This session focuses on identifying error causes and handling them dynamically and proactively. The means of dealing with errors is defined by where the error occurs and we will cover error handling in control flow, data flow, and script tasks in great detail. 

You will learn:
•To identify the different error handling methods in control flow, data flow, and script tasks 
•Be able to utilize event handlers to proactively handle errors 
•Be able to redirect data error and proactively handle data flow errors 
•Be able to identify error descriptions and log error details

## Title: Not So Basic Backup and Restore
 
**Abstract**:
You’re taking basic backups and you know how to restore them. Things have been running smoothly in your environment but you want to be confident that you’re equipped with the backup and restore tools, techniques, and options that you’ll need to adapt your strategies as business needs change. You’ve heard about piecemeal restores, filegroup backups, and backing up to multiple files, and now you’re ready to dig into learning more about these topics. In this demo-rich presentation, we’ll review scenarios using these options and you'll gain an understanding of some intermediate and advanced options related to backup performance, corruption detection, and the new SQL Server 2014 hybrid backup scenarios. You'll return to the office inspired to validate your backups and test your restore processes regularly, and you'll have references to great tools the SQL community has shared to help you get started.

## Title: Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations
 
**Abstract**:
With the introduction of in-memory based tables in SQL Server 2014, it’s natural to expect  significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  In this session, we are going to take a look at the changes to the indexing design for in-memory based objects and how it differs from existing disk based table indexing. Also, we are going to cover how to choose the appropriate indexes for your in-memory object to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.

## Title: SSMS Tips  Tricks
 
**Abstract**:
Almost everyone uses SSMS to write queries and to browse around on the server - but do you use all of the features that SSMS offers to increase your productivity? Come to this session, consisting mostly of demos, to see features built-in to SSMS that will improve your experience and productivity. Time permitting, we'll also go into some 3rd party products that also increase your productivity in SSMS.

## Title: Getting Started Reading Execution Plans
 
**Abstract**:
The best way to understand why your query is running slow is to look at the execution plan. But, knowing how to get started in execution plans, what to look for, what's important, can all be terribly confusing. This session will provide you with a simple set of tasks to get you started reading execution plans. You'll learn where to start, what to look for first, and you'll be better prepared to tune your queries. We'll also look at some methods you can use to write queries against the plans themselves in order to more easily and quickly identify potential issues within your plans. The information presented will be immediately applicable on the queries you have running back in the office.

## Title: "I Know What You Did Last Query" --SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Starting with the 2005 release, SQL Server captures information about the workload on an instance, which you can use to monitor the system, gather performance metrics, and validate system settings.  This information is available via Dynamic Management View and functions and officially they "return internal, implementation-specific state data." This session gives an introduction to these concepts, how they make DBA life much sweeter and we discuss many of the different community queries available to help you get jump started in your environment.  We also open up the floor for ideas of how you are using these views/functions.

## Title: Securing a Multi-Database Application
 
**Abstract**:
It is difficult enough to implement database security when dealing with only a single database. If multiple databases are involved, the task of providing a security model that follows industry best practices seems insurmountable.

In this session, we will do a quick review of access security best practices and then dive into the four different methods a DBA can use to tighten cross database access security. For each one we will walk through a demo and talk about how to implement it in your own environment. We will close the session with a discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of the four methods.
