##Title: Analyze and solve common wait stats scenarios##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a high frequently used piece of software which need to serve single requests and/or hundreds of thousands of requests in a minute. Within these different kinds of workloads Microsoft SQL Server has to handle the concurrency of tasks in a fashion manner. This demo driven session shows different scenarios where Microsoft SQL Server has to wait and manage hundreds of tasks. See, analyze and solve different wait stats due to their performance impact:
- CXPACKET: when a query goes parallel
- ASYNC_IO_COMPLETION: speed up IO operations (Growth / Backup / Restore)
- ASYNC_NETWORK_IO: What happens if your application refuses data?
- THREADPOOL starvation: crush of requests for Microsoft SQL Server
- PAGELATCH_xx: How does Microsoft SQL Server protects data?
 
**Speaker(s):**
- Uwe Ricken
 
*Track and Room*: Data Platform Administration, Performance Tuning  Optimisation - WK239

##Title: Back to the Future: Accelerating the Cloud Migration of Legacy SSIS with Azure Data Factory##
 
**Abstract**:
This session focuses on the new features to unblock/accelerate cloud migration of legacy SSIS, such as 2008 or earlier versions, with Azure Data Factory (ADF). We will first show you how to provision Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime (IR) – dedicated ADF servers for running SSIS – and extend it with custom/Open Source/3rd party components. We will next show you how to enable the following scenarios: running SSIS packages stored in Azure Files as first-class activities in ADF pipelines, accessing Azure SQL DB/Managed Instance with OLEDB connectors that are configured for Azure Active Directory authentication with ADF managed identity, testing SSIS packages in ADF from SSDT, scheduling SSIS jobs in ADF from SQL Server Agent/3rd party orchestrators that invoke Azure-enabled dtexec.exe, etc. We will finally show you the complete SSIS Migration Playbook to perform batch package assessments and batch package/job migrations using Data Migration Assistant/Service, dtutil.exe, scripts, etc.

##Title: Developing Cosmos DB for the Enterprise##
 
**Abstract**:
Azure Cosmos DB is an awesome multi-model database service that allows us to distribute our data on a global scale. It's fairly easy to get started with Cosmos DB, but when it comes to implementing it for use within our Enterprise applications, there are many things that you will want to consider when developing a Cosmos DB database.

In this session, I'll cover important topics that you'll want to consider when developing and administrating Cosmos DB for Enterprise use, including security considerations, partitioning, provisioning throughput for your databases and collections, distributing your data and much more.

By the end of this session, you should be able to take these learnings and apply them when developing Cosmos DB applications for your business.

##Title: Introducing SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters##
 
**Abstract**:
In the realm of data storage and processing, there are two major technologies which we deal with every day. On one side, we have relational data that is stored inside SQL Server, and on the other side, non-relational or very large datasets that do not fit the relational model which are stored on big data clusters like Hadoop or Spark. 
This introduces challenges when having to combine datasets across both these technologies. SQL Server was never built to process huge datasets in a distributed fashion or to handle non-relational data very well, meaning that in many cases you would have to resort to bringing your relational data into Hadoop or Spark clusters. 
SQL Server 2019 has the answer with Big Data Clusters: it combines SQL Server with HDFS, further scale out capabilities and Spark! 

In this session, you'll get an overview of the architecture as well as the capabilities of this amazing new featureset!

##Title: PowerApps and Flow Best Practices – Working with Data##
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft PowerApps and Flow have seen tremendous adoption in recent years. With an ever-growing need for rapid and agile solution development, these two products have the potential to solve business problems with very minimal development efforts. However, as with any product, with great simplification comes greater problems. As a data professional, it is our responsibility to make sure the data layer is accessed with proper security and efficiency. In this session, I will explore different methods to connect to the data from PowerApps and Flow. In this demo filled session, I will cover different scenarios for sending and receiving data in PowerApps using Flows.
Key Learning: The attendees will learn design best practices in PowerApps and Flow while working with data layer. 
Demos: 
1. Connecting to SQL Server databases 
2. Receiving data into PowerApps using Flow 
3. Sending data from PowerApps using Flow and receiving a response

##Title: Revealing the many Azure ML development and release processes##
 
**Abstract**:
Machine Learning in Azure ML incorporates a number of different products which can be used to to create and implement a Machine Learning solution. Which product do you want to use, when? Which is the appropriate tool for integrating with SQL Server or data in Azure? 
AML Studio, Workspace and Pipelines are different products which you can use to create or deploy a solution and they all start with AML. Understanding the differences between these products provides the information needed to be able to architect the appropriate solution in your environment. These session demos show how to create an end-to-end AML workflow to prepare data, create ML models, deploy models, and use data contained within SQL Server by integrating a number of tools including Databricks, Python, and Jupyter notebooks. Learn why you want to use AML Workspace for ML development collaboration, scaling, and management.

##Title: How to Deploy SQL Server Containers on Kubernetes in Azure##
 
**Abstract**:
When Microsoft released SQL Server 2017, it allowed us to run SQL Server in docker containers. This radical change provides a wider and open platform that data professionals can choose how to deploy and run SQL Server. 

This session will demonstrate how containers are a game changer for deploying and managing SQL Server. It  will also showcase how the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a scalable and highly available platform for SQL Server running in containers. 

Demonstrations will show how easy it is to create containers, deploy SQL Server in them, and how to automate and manage your SQL Server containers using Kubernetes on the Azure platform.

This session will show you the exciting future of SQL Server and you will walk away with knowledge of practical scenarios where SQL Server running in containers on Kubernetes may be the right deployment model for you.

##Title: Data Privacy, Security, Ethics and Compliance in a Data-Driven World##
 
**Abstract**:
New advances in technology coupled with the rate of change in the data-driven world are placing the issue of Privacy and Ethics at the forefront of public consciousness – forcing a discussion around the ethical use of data within business and the role that each data professional must play in ensuring that the highest standards are reached, maintained, and constantly evaluated. Technologies such as machine learning, artificial Intelligence, and big data processing are providing new business opportunities that must also account for privacy and ethics issues while maintaining a balance with compliance, security, and integrity of data. 
But what are the issues that individual data professionals should be aware of to avoid reputational damage to their companies and themselves? And what are the tools that can help them in their endeavors? 

This session will take a close look at some of these challenges and the tools that are available to help mitigate these issues and risks.

##Title: Get Comfortable with Query tuning and Execution Plans##
 
**Abstract**:
Even as many of the traditional DBA activities become automated or managed by Cloud providers, the ability to tune and optimize database query performance remains a desirable and marketable skill.

Central to ability to tune queries is an ability to use information provided from Execution plans, DMVs, Query Store and Extended Events.

In this demo based session we will look into:
- What information is available 
- How it can be used.
- Techniques to improve performance. 

Attendees will leave with an understanding of possibilities of turning queries and a roadmap for further learning.

This session will assume a basic knowledge of T-SQL and execution plans.

##Title: From AI to BI, how to do it all in Azure Synapse Analytics##
 
**Abstract**:
Azure Synapse was just announced at Microsoft Ignite and PASS Summit in November 2019. It aims to join the two large requirements of the evolving data world - relational data and big data. To fully unleash the power behind your data, you need to be able to leverage both these types of data and apply machine learning and business intelligence on top of it. Azure Synapse combines ingestion, preparation and analytical capabilities with Azure Machine Learning and PowerBI.

Join me in a session to walk through what an end to end solution might look like for you in this brand new product. We will go through how Synapse enables you to prep the data, train models and generate reports without having to leave the workspace. You will leave with a better understanding of the product, it's capabilities and guiding principles on using it.

##Title: Introduction to Dimensional Modeling for the Excel/Power BI Pro##
 
**Abstract**:
As an Excel user, you've probably been building Pivot Tables for years… but do you know the difference between a Fact and a Dimension? The reality is that PivotTables have done a great job of protecting us from needing to understand proper data modeling, but in modern Excel and Power BI that has changed.
In this session we will look at understanding the benefits of dimensional modeling. We will define and review key terms and best practices, and show you how to use Power Query to reshape, split and combine tables into their proper tabular formats for a model.

##Title: The road to hell is paved with good intentions##
 
**Abstract**:
AI and Machine Learning are the current leading trends in data and more developers and data scientists are getting involved in the next level of delivering knowledge and insight from the masses of data around us. Are we actually doing it correctly? Are we thinking about how biases in the training data sets (and the human biases that are part of the development of the algorithms) are affecting the results? Are we actually delivering insight? This talk walks through some real life examples and examines our role as data professionals in ensuring sound results.

##Title: Indexes: Under the Hood##
 
**Abstract**:
I’m sure we all have heard that using indexes is one way to tackle and solve those troublesome resource-heavy queries. In this talk we will be going through how indexes improve and sometimes hinder query performance. We will also look at a few different types of indexes and some use cases where they play best in query optimization. Will also be covering how indexes are structured, read by SQL Server and index fragmentation.

##Title: Automation for the DBA: Embrace your inner sloth##
 
**Abstract**:
DBAs and sysadmins never have time for the fun stuff. We are always restoring a DB for a dev or setting up a new instance for that new BI project. What if I told you that you can make all that time consuming busy-work disappear?
In this session we will learn to embrace the power of automation to allow us to sit back and relax..... or rather focus on the real work of designing better, faster systems instead of fighting for short time slots when we can do actual work.
Along the way we will see that we can benefit from the wide world of automation expertise already available to us and avoid re-inventing the wheel, again!
