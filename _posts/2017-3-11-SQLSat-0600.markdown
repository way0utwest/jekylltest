##Title: Tips that have saved my bacon##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, I propose to share some of the tricks I've used on the operational side of being a DBA.

There's saying, never perform small miracles, people to rely on them, but isn't it useful to have a few in your back-pocket. 

Everyone knows log-shipping is great for DR recovery, but what about using it for minor issues, like a delete or update gone bad? Want to move a large table someplace else (like that "oh it'll just be a small audit table, it won't grow large because we'll write the functionality later to keep it small" and they never do? UNC backups... an often overlooked but useful option for making a backup AND getting it off your server. Run a small operation where too many fingers have access to the operational DB and you want to catch them? These are some of the tricks I've picked up over the years and used more than once to perform small miracles and have saved my bacon or the bacon of others

##Title: Networking Internals for the SQL Server Professional##
 
**Abstract**:
Once data leaves your SQL Server do you know what happens or is the world of networking a black box to you? Would you like to know how data is packaged up and transmitted to other systems and what to do when things go wrong?  Are  you tired of being frustrated with the network team? In this session we introduce how data moves between systems on networks and TCP/IP internals. We’ll discuss real world scenarios showing you how your network’s performance impacts the performance of your SQL Server and even your recovery objectives.

##Title: Build ETL efficiently (10x) with Minimal Logging##
 
**Abstract**:
This session is designed to teach DBAs and developers the best strategy to transfer large data. 

We will first analyze how data gets accessed from the source and how data gets updated or inserted to the target server: index access patterns in read operation and minimal logging in wring operation. I will introduce TF610 and cover its benefit for minimal logging even in full recovery mode.

##Title: Power BI with Narrative Science: Look Who's Talking!##
 
**Abstract**:
You’ve created many Power BI reports and have become very skillful in connecting different data sources; your data model is filled with all necessary measures, calculated columns and eventually your Power BI report with various powerful visualizations is presented to your customers. What’s next? What if you can add some artificial intelligence to your report? 

There is a Chicago-based company Narrative Science that has developed a very unique component that can consume your report model numeric data and automatically generate textual narratives within your Power BI report. Such natural language descriptions can provide you with some unexpected insights and extend your common data interpretation. 

Let’s go together though this interactive data adventure and explore different scenarios of how this Narrative Science component can be used with your Power BI reports and check if it can also be used for Predictive Analytics.

##Title: Don't Let History Be a Mystery! Temporal Data in SQL Server 2016##
 
**Abstract**:
It's been said that the only constant is change, and no truism better defines the average database workload. With data constantly shifting in form and focus, DBAs and developers find themselves fielding myriad questions about whens and whys: When did this fact get updated? Why is data quality lower than it was last week? And where did my sales figures go?!? Solutions such as Change Tracking, Change Data Capture, and hand-rolled triggers can each be leveraged to help in this scenario, but with various ugly tradeoffs. SQL Server 2016 introduces Temporal Tables, a new technology that finally gets us what we've needed all along. In this session you'll learn how to enable seamless and automatic history collection, take control of a great query experience, and build on a solid platform to help your users understand data history. By taking advantage of this fantastic feature, you'll approach your next project ready to answer all of the questions that constant change brings to the table.

##Title: Designing Stored Procedure Solutions##
 
**Abstract**:
With a little T-SQL experience, you can create a stored procedure that completes a task. But it's harder to formulate a stored procedure solution with the big picture in mind. In this session, we will work through a real world scenario to develop a thorough solution. You will learn about: 

Asking the right questions to set yourself up for success
Making the case for stored procedures over ad hoc code and other objects
Pro tips for standardization and cross-version compliance
Reevaluating and expanding on your solution
Limiting inputs to reduce unexpected behaviors and errors
Choosing between alternate solutions
Evaluating for performance

This session is for data professionals who can write T-SQL, but haven't spent a lot of time in SQL development.

##Title: SQL Server High Availability in Azure IaaS##
 
**Abstract**:
Deploying mission critical SQL Server in Azure IaaS requires an in-depth understanding of storage, virtual networks, load balancers, SQL Server AlwaysOn and more. To qualify for Azure’s SLA of 99.95% availability, steps must be taken to mitigate downtime by leveraging Fault Domains and Update Domains in conjunction with traditional HA options.

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) replaces Azure “Classic” as the preferred deployment method in Azure. New features such as Deployment Templates and Resource Groups introduced in ARM make it a powerful tool in managing the entire life-cycle of SQL Server in Azure.

In this session attendees will learn how to leverage ARM to deploy SQL AlwaysOn Availability Groups and Failover Cluster Instances. Template Deployments and manual configurations using the Azure Portal and Azure PowerShell will be demonstrated.

##Title: Relational Data Architecture 101##
 
**Abstract**:
This presentation is a quick introduction for the DBA or developer who was just told that their boss promised a major new customer a scalable, well designed database. The customer will pay a lot of cash and years of ongoing business using this database… If you deliver it this week!

You’ll get a big bonus if you build this right, but you also remember what your co-workers did to the person who bungled the last database design… and wonder if that designer ever recovered! This session will introduce you to the fundamentals of Datatypes, Relational Algebra, and Normalization to help you avoid the major pitfalls and maybe get some sleep too!

This presentation is a survey of Data Architecture for the Intermediate DBA, it is not intended for experienced Data Modelers.

##Title: TempDB- More permanent impact than you think##
 
**Abstract**:
As a DBA you hear different theories and "gospel truths" about TempDB from many people. Frankly there is no single version of the truth except that if you don't use and manage it well, it will make your life a real h*ll.
What works for you in one situation may not work for you in another situation. What works for a situation today, might not guarantee its success for a similar situation tomorrow.

We will talk about 
Temporary User Objects, 
Work Tables, Interim Results
Version Store for Data
Standards for its configuration
Contention
Data Files Per CPU - Myth or Reality?
Dynamic Growth or Pre Sized?
Trace Flags to Manage Tempdb?
Should we store the entire Tempdb on SSDs?
Should we shrink TempDB or not?

Hopefully at the end of the session your knowledge on Tempdb won't be Temp.

##Title: Loading SQL Server Data with Powershell##
 
**Abstract**:
Powershell has become the defacto standard for scripting Microsoft products.  However, putting data in text files doesn’t scale.  Here I’m going to show you the ins and outs of loading data into SQL Server using Powershell for the purpose of centralizing collections.  We’re going to cover RBAR as well as bulk operations and the types of things you need to take into consideration in an enterprise setting.  This is a no holds barred session taught by an enterprise SQL Server scripting expert.  You can’t afford to miss this session if you do any level of scripting in your shop.

##Title: Introducing SQL Server on Linux##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is from Microsoft, and has been running exclusively on Windows since the early 90s! However, with the increasing usage of cloud computing and wide adoption of Linux in data centers and cloud service providers, Microsoft has decided to bring SQL Server to Linux.

In this session, I'll demonstrate how to set up and test SQL Server on Fedora/Red Hat and Ubuntu/Debian based systems. You'll gain practical insights on how to create your own SQL Server running on Linux and test its usage. I'll compare and contrast of its similarities and differences of SQL Server on these two vastly different operating systems. Come to my talk to keep abreast of this interesting development.

##Title: Visualize Your Transaction Log##
 
**Abstract**:
The SQL transaction log can be a mystery to many DBAs.  We live in the age of visualizations, so let#39;s visualize the log!  In this session, we will examine the purpose and organization of the transaction log and will explore the log through a unique visualization tool.  We will consider common performance issues that are related to the logging mechanism and how to overcome these problems.  Finally, we will discuss some techniques to monitor the log so that potential performance problems can be addressed pro-actively.

##Title: The Optimizer Secrets of 860X##
 
**Abstract**:
Debugging SQL using the 8600 Series of Trace Flags: You already know a thing or two about tuning a SQL query on Microsoft SQL Server. You can read an execution plan and know the most significant red flags to look for. And you have also learned about the important information revealed by SET STATISTICS statements. But you want to take it up another level! In this session, go even deeper with query tuning with three new lessons. First, we’ll examine a few new and seldom used features inside of SSMS specifically for query performance. Second, we’ll spend a bit of time learning query related DMVs and how to read query plans in directly within XML. Finally, we will discuss and demo a set of powerful Trace Flags, the 8600 series, that reveal additional details about how the query optimizer behaves as it processes a query.

##Title: Zen and the Art of Perfmon##
 
**Abstract**:
If your boss asked you for the list of the five most CPU-hungry databases in your environment six months from now for an upcoming licensing review, could you come up with an answer? Performance data can be overwhelming, but you can make sense of the mess. Twisting your brain and looking at the data in different ways can help you identify resource bottlenecks that are limiting your SQL Server performance today. Painting a clear picture of what your servers should be doing can help alert you when something is abnormal. Trending this data over time will help you project how much resource consumption you will have months away. Come learn how to extract meaning from your performance trends and how to use it to proactively manage the resource consumption from your SQL Servers.

##Title: Stretch Database and Managed Backups: Cloud Services for your SQL Servers##
 
**Abstract**:
Utilizing Azure cloud services does not mean moving all of your data or control away from your on-premises SQL Servers.  In this session we will cover the new SQL 2016 Stretch Database and the SQL 2014 Managed Backups to Azure features.  We will look at use-cases and limitations of both features to illustrate how these cloud services may fit into your current SQL Server environment.

##Title: Strategies for SQL Server Index Analysis##
 
**Abstract**:
Properly managing indexes for a database is a common usse in many environments. When reviewing an index, should it have a single or multiple columns? Should the table be a heap, a clustered index or clustered columnstore index? These considerations are often at the forefront when analyzing your indexes. In this session, we#39;ll look at easy methods for identifying new indexes, we'll review patterns for index consolidation, and discuss how and when to remove indexes. At the end, you'll have a strategy that helps design indexes to improve performance.

##Title: Let Her Finish: Supporting Women's Voices from meetings to the board room##
 
**Abstract**:
Next time you attend a meeting, watch what happens when women at the table offer ideas. If your office is like most in America, you’ll notice women are interrupted almost three times as often as men. Some interruptions are to assert dominance but sometimes people do it to be helpful  offer affirmation. Regardless of the intent, the results are the same. Women are being left out of the conversation. The consequences are real. Male executives that speak more frequently in meetings are rewarded with 10% higher competence ratings from peers  better performance reviews from bosses. This translates into $ when raises and bonuses are handed out.
 This discussion will cover positive solutions that help women’s voices be heard. Women need to be more assertive. We need to learn to say “Stop interrupting me.” and “I just said that.” However, men can be, no HAVE to be, part of the solution. They can help women become part of the conversation.

##Title: Why are you still taking backups?##
 
**Abstract**:
Keep doing things the same way because they have always worked in the past is a very comfortable mistake we all make in many areas. That includes backup strategies and service account administration. In this one hour presentation full of demos I will explore many options available in SQL Server 2016 and Azure that can potentially reduce the amount of data and time required for backups and even eliminate the need all together. It sounds scary but it will be really fun.

##Title: A Closer Look at Distributed Availability Groups##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2016 introduces a new way of deploying an availability group: Distributed Availability Groups. This new form of an AG allows you to span different underlying Windows Server Cluster topologies which can enable both disaster recovery and migration scenarios. This session will cover how Distributed Availability Groups work, how you need to think about them in a possible deployment scenario, as well as show a demo of one in action.

##Title: Protecting Your Data with Encryption##
 
**Abstract**:
We’ve all seen the recent news stories about companies whose data has been stolen by hackers.  What was once a rare event has become all too common, and companies large and small are at risk.  While it isn’t always possible to prevent intrusions, you can reduce the risk by encrypting your data.  In this presentation, I’ll show you the four ways that SQL Server provides to encrypt data: hashes, cell-level encryption, database-level encryption (also known as transparent data encryption), and backup encryption.  We’ll also discuss the keys required for each type of encryption and discuss how to protect the keys themselves.

##Title: Emergency! Are You Ready for Disaster to Strike?##
 
**Abstract**:
Most of the time pilots are learning to fly, they're actually learning how to recover from emergency conditions. While we as Database Administrators focus on taking backups, how much time do we actually spend practicing recovering with those backups? This session will focus on the kinds of situations that can dramatically affect a data center, and how to use checklists to practice recovery processes to assure business continuity.

##Title: Digging Out From Corruption##
 
**Abstract**:
A "Disaster" doesn't need to be on a massive scale to cause widespread destruction in your enterprise. Simple things like failing hardware, strange storage bugs, a forgotten WHERE clause, or an angry employee can either cause devastation or be just a nuisance to the properly-prepared DBA. This session is a survey of recovery techniques that should be in every DBA's toolbox.

##Title: Introduction to SQL Server Indexes##
 
**Abstract**:
Having the right indexes supporting your databases is a critical need. But how do you determine what indexes are most effective? Should you have single or multi-column indexes? Should the index be filtered? What are included columns and columnstore indexes and when should they be used? In this session, we explore various ways to implement indexes and provide the performance expected out of your databases.

##Title: Learn History from Temporal Tables##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2016 came out with a bucket full of cool new features. One of them is Temporal Tables. They are basically history tables  of the normal tables; that allow us to retrieve data from any point in time for every change such as updates and deletes . It does this all without any change to application code and without using any behind the scene triggers. In this session, we will see what the requirements of creating temporal tables are. We will see the demo on insert and update functionality and how to query historical information using new TSQL clause. It will also cover some security concerns around theTemporal Tables.

##Title: The Lost Science of Set Theory##
 
**Abstract**:
Many database developers today do not have a Computer Science degree and may also have begun their career developing software using procedural programming languages (Java, C#, etc.). As a result, they may not have the background needed to conceptualize solutions in terms of sets of data and therefore may not be able to develop efficient set-based queries. In this session, we will review the basics of set theory and how it applies to database development to enable you to turn cursors, loops, and other procedural programming practices into efficient set-based operations that make the most use of a relational database engine.

##Title: Wait Statistics - The Top 5 Waits You Should Know##
 
**Abstract**:
Wait statistics are a great tool for troubleshooting performance problems in SQL Server. However, there are so many different wait types in SQL Server, it can be challenging to determine what to focus on and what can be ignored. Even after discovering that SQL Server is waiting for something, most DBAs don't know where to look next. In this session, we'll examine 5 of the most frequently seen wait types in SQL Server and how to troubleshoot each of them. You'll learn how to determine the root cause of a particular wait type, and how to avoid common mistakes made when troubleshooting with wait statistics.

##Title: Isolation Levels – Understanding Transaction Temper Tantrums##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will review Isolation levels and how they affect applications that run on SQL Server.  We will explore what happens when multiple applications accessing the same data use different isolation levels, and how that effects the server as a whole.   We will also explore different ways to relieve these tantrums, and make your applications play nice together.

##Title: Welcome To the 2016 Query Store!##
 
**Abstract**:
One of my favorite new features in SQL Server 2016 is the Query Store. The Query Store houses valuable information on performance of your queries as well as gives you great insights into your query workload. This presentation will take a look at the Query Store, how it works and the type information it holds and how you can use it to analyze performance issues.  New DMVs will be introduced and the performance impact of enabling the Query Store will be discussed. Both DBAs and developers can increase their performance tuning skills by attending this session.

##Title: How SQL Monitor speeds YOU up!##
 
**Abstract**:
Are you a lone DBA shop or a big shop with too many servers to handle?  If so, how do you keep up with the availability and performance of your SQL Servers? Have you rolled your own monitoring solution…even that’s hard to keep up with. It’s time for a professional grade monitoring tool to help YOU do your job…more efficiently. In this session we’re going to discuss why you should monitor your SQL servers, and specifically why you should use a monitoring tool. We’ll introduce Redgate’s SQL Monitor and demonstrate how you can use this tool to make YOU faster and your SQL Servers!

##Title: Parameter Sniffing the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly##
 
**Abstract**:
Parameter sniffing is something that more than often helps performance on your servers; however, there are times when it can hinder performance as well. In this session we will define exactly what parameter sniffing is, and examine when it is good and when it is bad. Lastly, we will explore the different options available to fix bad parameter sniffing. After this session, you will be able to locate and fix bad parameter sniffing when it occurs on your servers.
