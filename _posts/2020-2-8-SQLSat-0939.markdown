## Title: More Common Than You Think: Mental Illness in Tech
 
**Abstract**:
Mental illness is more common than you think.  One in four Americans suffers from a mental illness each year.  In the tech community, this is often not talked about.  Many times, people feel alone and isolated in the tech community with us mostly being introverted people.  It is time to start talking about mental illness out in the open and honestly about how it affects us and those around us.

In this session, we will talk about what mental illness is and what it is not.  How my mental illness has affected me.  How it effects the tech industry.  How mental illness can affect you and how you can tell if you are starting to have issues.  What to say and what not to say to people you know that are affected by mental illness.  Finally, how to get help and where reach out for help.

## Title: A metadata approach to fixed width files
 
**Abstract**:
Face it, using SSIS to work with fixed width flat files is a pain.  The SSIS interface has you clicking around to mark each column. Then you use another interface to set each columns data types, etc.  And when you are done, you still need to document the file structure for your users.  What if you could simply document the file structure and then generate the ETL from the document?
To demonstrate such an approach, I build an Excel file describing US census data that has more than 300 columns of fixed width data.  After demonstrating how this file communicates to business users, I will generate an SSIS package from that metadata using BIML Script.  Then I will also look at how you can generate a SQL Server bulk insert format file from the same metadata.  A small amount of C# code can generate quite a large extract.

## Title: Make Your Company Conversational using Azure Cognitive Services
 
**Abstract**:
Customers and users increasingly demand more personal and prompt communication from companies and brands with which they interact. How can data professionals help fill that need? The incredible power and instant accessibility of the Azure Cognitive Services Language and Speech APIs, combined with other Azure services, put the power in our hands. From translating between languages to make communication more efficient to analyzing support communications to ensure customers are happy, Azure Cognitive Services allows data professionals to enhance a brand's interaction with and impression in the customer community. This demo-heavy sessions walks through practical applications of these APIs that you can apply at home or at work immediately after the session.

## Title: Do I Need To M?
 
**Abstract**:
Power Query is an powerful tool enabling the data analyst in creating usable data. It is one product that can truly claim to be user friendly, as so much of the functionality is available within the UI.

But, and there is always a but, sometimes you need to do things that are just not available through the UI. This is where you need to get down and get dirty, and manage the M code directly (M being the language that drives Power Query).

This session is all about the value of developing skills in M. Starting with a brief intro to M and some references to resources to help develop those skills further, we will then demonstrate a number of things you can do by directly coding in M, things that are not as simple or just can't be done through the UI.

The session will be using Power Query in Excel as Excel is still the most used BI delivery tool, but all of the techniques and code also apply to Power BI.

## Title: Change Tracking: A Near Bullet-Proof ETL Synchronization Control
 
**Abstract**:
Change Tracking came out with SQL Server 2008, but SS2012 almost eclipsed it with Change Data Capture. Change Tracking is now the red-headed stepchild, but in many cases may be the best solution for data ETL movement from an SQL Server OLTP database to a data warehouse or reporting database. This session will provide a review of change tracking syntax and implementation with detailed demos. It will then dive into an actual ETL subset implementation from the AdventureWorks database to a data warehouse solution (modified AdventureWorksDW) with detailed code discussion and demos using TSQL only (no SSIS).  A variation of this implementation has run every 5 minutes with never a failure in over 7 years.  Come learn how you can adapt the supplied code to have near real-time in your data warehouse (or reporting database).

## Title: Getting Started with Apache Spark
 
**Abstract**:
As companies work to gain insight from ever-increasing amounts of data, data platform practitioners need tools which can scale along with the data. Early big data solutions in the Hadoop ecosystem assumed that data sizes overwhelmed available memory, emphasizing heavy disk usage to coordinate work between nodes. As the cost of memory decreases and the amount of memory available per server increases, we see a shift in the makeup of big data systems, emphasizing heavy memory usage instead of disk. Apache Spark, which focuses on memory-intensive operations, has taken advantage of this hardware shift to become the dominant solution for problems requiring distributed data. In this talk, we will take an introductory look at Apache Spark. We will review where it fits in the Hadoop ecosystem, cover how to get started and some of the basic functional programming concepts needed to understand Spark, and see examples of how we can use Spark to solve issues when analyzing large data sets.

## Title: Using calculation groups in DAX
 
**Abstract**:
Calculation groups are the most important feature introduced in DAX after variables in 2015. By using calculation groups, you can apply transformations to existing measures without having to create new measures in the model. For example, you can define the year-over-year calculation once and apply it to all the measures you want. Yet, calculation groups can do more than that.
This session introduces the syntax of calculation groups, when they should be used and several examples of use cases. You will also learn how calculation groups work internally and what are the limits of this amazing tool.

I am an independent consultant based in the UK, specializing in all things Excel, especially delivering BI within Excel. 

I came to appreciate the power and versatility of Excel as an enterprise tool in the mid-90s when managing the delivery of a data warehouse project. 

Now a freelance consultant, I specialize in Excel automation and BI delivered via Excel. An 11 year veteran of Microsoft#39;s MVP program, my life mission is to persuade small and medium corporates that data analysis and BI is important to them too, and that Power BI can help then find that information, in a straight-forward and cost-effective manner.
