## Title: SSIS-restart, scale up/out, load balance.
 
**Abstract**:
This presentation is a journey through some of the common challenges facing DBAs and SSIS developers: scaling up and/or out to increase throughput, load balancing, recoverability and restartability, basic process auditing, multiple job dependency checking.  Next we will review the essential elements to building a framework based on the work pile design pattern that will help resolve many of the issues these challenges may bring. The end goal is a framework that will manage a set of jobs that can recover from common errors, be spread across multiple servers, check load consistency and make sure that nothing runs unless the appropriate upstream data is available.

## Title: Building an Effective Data Warehouse Architecture
 
**Abstract**:
You’re a DBA, and your boss asks you to determine if a data warehouse would help the company. So many questions pop into your head: Why use a data warehouse? What’s the best methodology to use when creating a data warehouse? Should I use a normalized or dimensional approach? What’s the difference between the Kimball and Inmon methodologies? Does the new Tabular Model change things? What’s the difference between a data warehouse and a data mart? Is there any hardware that is optimized for a data warehouse? Join this session for the answers to all these questions. You’ll leave with information that will amaze your boss and lead to a big raise… – or at least lead you down the correct path to adding business value to your organization!

## Title: The Modern Data Warehouse
 
**Abstract**:
Current models of data warehousing are being challenged by data that is coming at us bigger, faster, and more variable that it ever has before. In traditional models we would throw out much of the data or aggregate to a course grain so that we could gain query performance but may loose some of the nuance needed for deep analytics. How is Microsoft bridging the GAP between the need for speed in both data ingestion and query performance? How is Microsoft integrating the worlds of relational and non-relational data? This session will discuss aspects of Microsoft's data warehouse vision ranging from traditional SMP, our MPP appliance, what we are doing in the cloud and how it all works together.

## Title: SQL Server 2014 Data Access Layers
 
**Abstract**:
How often have our SQL Servers been bogged down with a myriad of users issuing lengthy and poorly constructed or poorly performing queries against our tables and views.More often than not,nearly bringing our systems to their knees.Nowhere is this truer than within the financial world where heavy number crunching is par for the course.This beginners to intermediate level hands-on presentation is aimed at the SQL Server developer and business analyst alike and will show the attendee how we had managed to eliminate 90 % of our poorly performing queries by creating a data access layer which provides our end users with a suite of well developed and tuned SQL Server FUNCTIONS and UDT's with which to render their data.

## Title: See the Future with SQL Running Totals - Never Run Out of Anything Again
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever run out of something?  Do you need to order things now that you know will be needed by a certain date?  
This seemingly simple problem can get complicated, whether you are making a shopping list for a party, or doing supply chain planning for a factory.
Special functions in T-SQL and SSRS can help you build a visual model of future supply and demand, so you will know if all your bases are covered.
We will demonstrate algorithms for tracking running totals and check that they scale well to handle big data sets, and build a flexible report to answer "what if" scenarios.  Come learn how to use SQL Server tools to build a looking glass to the future!

## Title: A dive into Data Quality Services
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2014: Data quality and data cleansing have always been major challenges to any enterprise that deals with data. For those of us who have dealt with Data Profiler Tasks in SQL Server 2008, we were shocked yet pleasantly surprised with the great advances that Microsoft has made with the advent of Data Quality Services, in the SQL Server 2012 release. In this hands-on presentation we shall be looking at how to set up a new knowledge base, based upon an existing one, set up rules, do knowledge discovery within the new knowledge base and finally cleanse the data through a data quality project. The end results being more effective data, guaranteed to keep end users and management happy.

## Title: Best Practices to Deliver BI Solutions
 
**Abstract**:
If your company is planning to build a data warehouse or BI solution, you need to be aware that BI projects have high failure rates. Gartner says between 70% to 80% of corporate business intelligence projects fail. And with “big data” adding more complexity you can expect even more failures. However, the major causes of these failures are well known and can be avoided by implementing a set of best practices.

I have worked on dozens of end-to-end BI projects and have seen my share of successes and failures. I will talk about the reasons BI projects fail and share best practices and lessons learned so your BI project will fall into the “successful” category.
