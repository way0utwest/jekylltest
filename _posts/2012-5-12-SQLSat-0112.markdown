##Title: Introduction to FileTables##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2012 introduces the first significant enhancement to FILESTREAM: FileTables. FileTables use the underlying FILESTREAM storage, but expose the stored data using traditional Windows file I/O APIs. In addition, they also support hierarchical data storage (read "folders"). This session will show how to set up your SQL Server instance to support FileTables, how to create a FileTable and how to access it using standard Windows file APIs.
It may be valuable to attend the Introduction to FILESTREAM session also.

##Title: Best Practices for Monitoring Databases on VMware##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server on VMware???  Many of our customers are either virtualizing databases or planning to do so soon. I hear from many groups that attempted running their database on VMware but went back to physical hardware because of performance issues. There are many reasons this may have happened, but quite often the decision to go back to physical was not based on hard facts. This presentation will explore the fundamentals of monitoring databases running in a VMware environment. If you are using classic O/S monitoring tools, you may be getting misleading data. Understand what metrics are important and how to get to that data.

##Title: Become a PowerShell Pop Star##
 
**Abstract**:
So you've heard about this cool scripting language from Microsoft called PowerShell. Maybe you've even thought "I need to learn something about that." Well today is your lucky day, in this session we'll take you from a PowerShell "noob" to Pop Star in one fast paced demo filled session. We'll start with the basics, cmdlets, variables, and providers. Then we'll look a quick look programming fundamentals, such as as branching, looping, script blocks and variable scoping. Finally we'll get into the advanced, fun stuff like functions, error handling, working with file types and wrap it up with creating a spiffy user interface. They'll be rolling out the red carpet when you get back to work Monday for the newest PowerShell Pop Star.

##Title: What Sequence objects are (and are not)##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2012 adds a new object to our arsenal called a sequence that can will give us the capability to implement automatically incrementing values. However, it cannot replace a lot of functionality that we have used a numbers table and windowing functions for (though they can be complimentary to one another). In this session I will demonstrate the uses and performance characteristics of sequences, including how they compliment the use of number tables and windowing functions to create surrogate key and sorting values, and more.

##Title: Moving Day - Successful SQL Migrations##
 
**Abstract**:
Moving day is one of life's most stressful times.  Details drown you, critical items consume time and attention, and there is always someone demanding you get something done now.  This is true whether you are moving your home or your data platform.  SQL Server migrations are a core competency for a DBA.  This presentation will give you a strong structured process for a successful migration using examples focused on SharePoint workloads.

##Title: STOP! Consolidate and Listen!##
 
**Abstract**:
In today's economic times, we are being asked to do more with less. Less budget, less hardware and yet our data needs keep growing! So how do we keep our database infrastructure humming along given these restrictions? In this session we will talk about different options of consolidation including: database-level consolidation, instance-level consolidation, and virtualization. Additionally we will also talk about some of the tools and methods you can use today to help you consolidate your SQL Server environment and do more with less!

##Title: Windowing Functions: THE Reason to Upgrade to 2012##
 
**Abstract**:
For the first time since SQL 7 there is a compelling reason for EVERY SQL Server user to upgrade to the next version and this time around the reason is Windowing Functions.   And these are NOT limited to Enterprise Edition, like so many other really useful and important features!  The range of data processing needs that can be very efficiently and cleanly solved with these tools is stunning. In this demo-packed session we will cover as many features as we can pack into an hour's time, and you can take the demo code back home with you to review at your leisure!

##Title: Time Saving Tips  Tricks for SSMS 2012##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Management Studio can be really annoying sometimes.  Over the years a few really nice features have been added that you may have overlooked or just couldn’t find.  This session will focus some time saving tips and tricks for SSMS 2008 R2.  We’ll also cover a few great new features being introduced in SSMS 2012.  Since I can’t provide scripts for this session I guess I better get started working on some screen shots on where they hid all this stuff!
