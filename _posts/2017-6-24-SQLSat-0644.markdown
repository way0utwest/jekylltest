## Title: Mobile BI with Microsoft tools
 
**Abstract**:
In SQL Server 2016 Microsoft added support for mobile reports to Reporting Services.
They also released the Mobile Report Publisher for authoring and creation of mobile reports. This application is based on Datazen technology, a company that Microsoft acquired in 2015.
As Microsoft stated, using only one mobile BI app users will access dashboards and reports on mobile devices.

Now developers must choose a tool  for developing BI optimized for mobile devices: SSRS,  Mobile Report Publisher (former Datazen) or Power BI? The question is: which one to choose? What are the key factor for supporting the correct decision? 
We will provide a clear and understandable overview of each product, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.
Based on some real examples we will set out a comparison matrix to find the best way to meet your needs with the right mobile reporting tool.

## Title: T-SQL User-Defined Functions, or: How to kill performance in one, easy step
 
**Abstract**:
User-defined functions in SQL Server are very much like custom methods and properties in .Net languages. At first sight, they seem to be the perfect tool to introduce code encapsulation and reuse in T-SQL. So why is this feature mostly avoided by all T-SQL gurus?
The reason is performance. In this session, you will learn how user-defined functions feed the optimizer with misleading and insufficient information, how the optimizer fails to use even what little information it has, and how this can lead to shocking query performance.
However, you will also see that there is a way to avoid the problems. With just a little extra effort, you can reap the benefits of code encapsulation and reuse, and still get good performance.

## Title: In the name of the resources: Aggregating data
 
**Abstract**:
The queries that are used for reports are usually the least efficient because you are dealing with huge amounts of data from tables sometimes joined many, many times. In this session we will go through good and bad examples of aggregating the data from your relational database. You will see tips on how to get good use of the indexes, how to lower the number of actual table queries and other  tricks that will make your queries run faster.

## Title: Doing Hadoop with Azure HDInsight
 
**Abstract**:
Hadoop is everywhere. Growing from a project within Yahoo, it soon became a very popular tool for data analytics. Today, there are a lot of Hadoop installations in major companies and Hadoop is capable of analyzing large amounts of data. In this session, we will have a look at what Hadoop by outlining different tools such as HCatalog, Hive, Pig, Storm, Spark and HBase and will then look at HDInsight and its benefits.

## Title: String Concatenation Done Right
 
**Abstract**:
Numerous techniques for concatenating string data can be found online, and even in some books. In this session you will learn two of them that are reliable, and fairly easy to understand, implement, and deploy. You will also learn how to control the order of the values being concatenated, a feature that is not natively provided by SQL Server.

## Title: Building Disaster Recovery solution with AlwaysOn
 
**Abstract**:
This presentation will cover generic issues and challenges involved in building a Disaster Recovery site, and then show you how you can build a hot DR site using the AlwaysOn Availability Groups technology in SQL Server 2016. It will provide tips and recommendations based on real life implementation. While the focus of the session will be on building a remote DR solution, much of the content will also be applicable to maintaining a local standby server using AlwaysOn.

## Title: Beginning Data Science-From Novice to Professional
 
**Abstract**:
Where to begin the step 1 of data science to become a Data scientist? What are these Data Scientists up to? This is an initial data science session, for a novice and learn how easily you can step in to Data Science and start to become a professional.

 How can we see and try using a data scientist statistical model in our day to day familiar tool like Microsoft SQL Server?

 Thanks to Microsoft for integrating R Revolution within SQL Server 2016. We all now have the opportunity to use R packages and see the results within SQL 2016 and also to utilize it for any applications and/or Reporting services.

## Title: Window functions are your friends
 
**Abstract**:
What does SUM(Salary) OVER (ORDER BY EmployeeID RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) do exactly? Did you know that you can delete all duplicates in a table with just one query?

Window functions are great! They open a whole new world of elegant data analysis. Their only problem is that they seem complicated at first glance. In this session we will get OVER() them and see how can we use them together with aggregation, analytic and ranking functions. After this session creating queries with things like running totals will be a piece of cake!

## Title: Parameter Sniffing Problem with Stored Procedures
 
**Abstract**:
Your stored procedure is slow in the application, but works perfect in SSMS! In this presentation it will be clarified why this happens and why parameter sniffing is a problem in SQL Server stored procedures. Of course, several solutions will be presented  and it will be discussed which solution is applicable in which scenario.
