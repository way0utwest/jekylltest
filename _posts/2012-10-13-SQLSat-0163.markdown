## Title: Automating SSIS Development with Biml
 
**Abstract**:
SSIS is a great tool for transferring data from one data source to another, and for implementing complex ETL processes. However, there are some painful shortcomings that make it difficult to automate package creation, easily reuse patterns and templates, and create packages directly from schema information and other metadata.  The free and open source BIDS Helper Add-In offers support for automatically generating SSIS packages using the Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml). 
In this session we will start by showing the power of Biml.  We will then step back, and start from the beginning of using BimlScript.  Once we cover the basics, we will cover practical examples using the BIDS Helper add-in to automate SSIS development.
