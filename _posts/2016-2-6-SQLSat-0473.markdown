## Title: Inside the Black Box - Making Sense of Service Broker
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Service Broker is often seen as a black box. Messages go in, and hopefully they come out on the other side.  But when they don't, DBAs typically don’t know where to look. Trying to figure out what’s wrong quickly turns into a guessing game.
It’s not that complicated once you understand how it all works. 
Service Broker is an asynchronous messaging technology built into SQL Server that allows you to scale out your application, replicate data or perform ETL, all while guaranteeing messages are delivered and processed in the right order.   In this session, we'll discuss the basics of the Service Broker architecture, its components, and deployment options.  We will discuss troubleshooting tips and performance best practices to help you deploy a Service Broker solution in your own environment.

## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from t
 
**Abstract**:
Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. "Virtualize First" is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too "critical" to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments. Got an SQL virtualization or performance question? Bring it!

## Title: Every Byte Counts: Why Your Data Type Choices Matter
 
**Abstract**:
Ever encounter a table consisting only of BIGINT, CHAR(255), and NVARCHAR(MAX) columns? Did your gut tell you that this is bad, but you had difficulty explaining why? Did you know that these data type choices can be a real performance killer? 

Attend this session to learn how database records are stored within SQL Server, and why all data types are not created equal. Armed with that knowledge, we will then explore several performance scenarios that may be impacting your systems right now! 

When you leave, you will be able to explain to your colleagues why data type choices matter, assess your own systems, and implement some best practices to mitigate these performance killers.

## Title: DBA 102: Now What
 
**Abstract**:
Things happened, you got a knock on the head and when you awoke your boss said “congratulations” you are our new DBA, perhaps you came to the role in a more intentional manner or are just DBA curious.  Your environment is running but you are wondering “now what” or “what’s next”.  In this session we will give an overview of a few things that could, perhaps even should be next and give some recommendations as to where you can find more resources on-line and maybe even suggest a few sessions to attend at this very SQL Saturday.  So, what will be covered, recovery strategy (you think I mean backups, I don’t, you’ll see why), a touch on performance tuning with a hint of indexing thrown in, add a pinch of high availability and a smattering of security all of which will give you some idea how to answer “now what”.

## Title: The SSIS Catalog - What is it and Why should I use it.
 
**Abstract**:
The SSIS Catalog was introduced in SQL Server 2012.  This session is going to explore what the catalog is and how it can improve the scheduling and tracking package executions.  One of the biggest advantages to the SSIS Catalog is that it allows a single package to be ran with multiple environments without having to make any changes to the package.  First, we will review some bonus material with SSIS project parameters.  Then review their use with the catalog's environments.  Next, the fun will begin with examining the catalog and using it to execute packages in different environments.  Finally,  we will take a look that the catalog's logging and database to monitor and review the packages executions.

## Title: Flying Through the Clouds--Performance Tuning in Azure
 
**Abstract**:
So between your management and Microsoft, it’s been decided that you are moving your SQL Server workloads to the cloud. Whether it’s Microsoft Azure SQL Database or running SQL Server in a VM, there are unique performance tuning challenges that are different in a cloud environment. Just like when you moved your SQL Servers from physical to virtual environments, you will learn new techniques for tuning workloads. In this session you will learn about:

•	Optimizing TempDB in an Azure VM
•	Reducing latency between application VMs and database VMs
•	Right sizing Azure VMs for performance and cost
•	Striping I/O across devices in Azure VMs
•	Performance Tuning in Azure DB

You will learn about techniques that will not just improve your system performance, but save you company money, which can be easily quantified just in time for your performance review.

## Title: Maintain SQL Server Performance Baseline w/PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
Maintaining a solid set of information about our servers and their performance is critical when issues arise, and often help us see a problem before it occurs.  Building a baseline of performance metrics allows us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.

## Title: Answering the question, "What happened?" with Query Store
 
**Abstract**:
One of the most highly anticipated new features in the SQL Server 2016 release is Query Store.  It's been referred to as the "flight recorder" for SQL Server because it tracks query information, namely plans and runtime statistics.  If you've ever had to drop everything and try to troubleshoot a sudden drop in performance, then you've probably already realized the value of this feature.  In this session we'll explore the Query Store feature using the latest CTP of SQL Server 2016.  We'll review the different options for Query Store, look at examples of what gets collected, dig through the included reports, and see how you can force SQL Server to use a specific plan for a query.

## Title: TSQL Coding Techniques - Are You Playing with Fire?
 
**Abstract**:
The good news? T-SQL is one of the easiest coding languages to learn.  The bad news? Writing scalable T-SQL that performs optimally is an art that takes years to master. In this session, learn about some common T-SQL Troublemakers - Looping, Scalar Functions, Implicit Conversions, Non-Parameterized SQL and Parameter Sniffing.  Through examples and demos in this session you will witness the situational pitfalls of the techniques above.  With each demo, you will be given an alternate T-SQL solution that solves the same problem in an efficient and scalable manner.  Let's get things moving!

## Title: Something Stinks: Avoiding Parameter Sniffing Issues
 
**Abstract**:
Some of the most painful database problems involve queries that have inconsistent performance. These queries can run fast on your dev box, but not in QA. These queries can be fast in the morning, but not in the afternoon. I take an in-depth look at the causes of this variable performance. How to recognize such queries at development time and what you can do about it. When we're done, developers who write SQL will have a solid set of tools to help write consistent, predictably fast SQL.

## Title: Diagnosing SQL Amnesia: Where is Your Memory Going?
 
**Abstract**:
Memory problems in humans can be caused by injuries, traumatic events, or physical deficiencies. Interestingly enough, the same holds true for SQL Server. In this session, learn about common patterns and problems that affect SQL Server memory usage and how to solve them, based on real-world scenarios. We start with an overview of the SQLOS memory manager and the internals behind the memory components that are necessary to troubleshoot problems. We then move straight into sample scenarios. From incorrectly sized hardware for a specific workload to code and schema design challenges that tax SQL Server memory usage, this session gives you the practical tools necessary to tackle even the most challenging memory problems.

## Title: The Secret to High Performance Code...The Devil’s in the Data
 
**Abstract**:
You found code you need in a “Holy Grail” article complete with test data and tests across several methods “clearly” identifying the best one to use.  Excited at your good fortune, you quickly download the code, rerun the tests on your Dev box . It “passes” with flying colors.  You promote the code to production and go home on time for a change.

The next day, your boss and the DBA are waiting for you in your cube and, look, the DBA has a bat with your name on it because your code brought the server to its knees and the code failed.

How is that possible?  The answer is, “The Devil’s in the Data”.

Whether you’re an SQL “Newbie” or seasoned veteran, this “Black Arts” session will teach you most of what you need to know to build large quantities of just about any test data you might imagine and more quickly than you ever dreamed.  It’ll also show you how to avoid the pitfalls that lead to the DBA with the bat. ;-)

## Title: Hacking Expos#233; - Using SSL to Secure SQL Server Connections
 
**Abstract**:
You know all the ways to protect your database when it is at rest, but what about when someone connects and starts running some queries? What if they connect and don't do anything? Just how exposed is that data? 
We will assume the role of a hacker and, by using a simple technique, we will sniff packets on a network to reveal what data is being sent. You may be shocked! 
We will then secure our database connections with a simple self-signed SSL certificate. 
Once secured, we will resume the role of the hacker and look inside the packets to see what has changed. 
*Warning - Do not try these demos at work without proper permissions as actual hacking techniques are used.

## Title: Troubleshooting SQL Server Performance Using Wait Stats
 
**Abstract**:
Sometimes the hardest part of diagnosing performance issues is determining where to start. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could just ask SQL Server what’s slowing it down? Good news: you can! Every single time SQL Server has to wait on a resource it keeps track of it in its Wait Stats. That valuable data can be used to narrow down your troubleshooting efforts and help you get to the root cause quicker. This session will provide an introduction to Wait Stats and explain how they can be leveraged to improve your performance tuning skills.

## Title: The Lost Science of Set Theory
 
**Abstract**:
Many database developers today do not have a Computer Science degree and may also have begun their career developing software using procedural programming languages (Java, C#, etc.). As a result, they may not have the background needed to conceptualize solutions in terms of sets of data and therefore may not be able to develop efficient set-based queries. In this session, we will review the basics of set theory and how it applies to database development to enable you to turn cursors, loops, and other procedural programming practices into efficient set-based operations that make the most use of a relational database engine.
