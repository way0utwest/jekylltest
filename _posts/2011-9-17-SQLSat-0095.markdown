##Title: Unleash the Tablix##
 
**Abstract**:
Tablix = Table + Matrix. Got it? Good. But wait, what exactly is a Tablix good for then? And where is it in your SSRS Toolbox? Not to worry. Angel will show you how to wake up the Tablix control introduced in SQL Server 2008 R2 using some real-world examples. In this session, you'll learn why the Tablix features help solve many common reporting scenarios such as Timelining, Summarizing, and Subtotaling. Important takeaways from this session are how to aggregate everywhere in your Tablix with single formulas and condensing very wide reports. We’ll also cover some visualization  reporting techniques to help solve some pretty common reporting requests such as Exporting to Excel. Please welcome: Table, Matrix, and List.

##Title: Virtualizing your SQL Server Environments##
 
**Abstract**:
If you are a DBA, and you are hearing from your management team "Everything else is being virtualized, when can we virtualize your SQL Servers?", then you need to come to this session. In it we will discuss the concepts required to properly virtualize SQL Server. You can take control and lead the virtualization conversation by building a fact based plan for when to virtualize, and when to go with a physical infrastructure. You need ammunition and hard evidence to push the server and virtualization teams to consider your SQL Server environments in a different light. What metrics are important for you to capture before go live, and what metrics you must monitor proactively for success.

##Title: Problem Solving with Common Table Expressions##
 
**Abstract**:
Are you looking for an easier way to de-duplicate your data? Do you need to join a SELECT statement to itself six ways to Sunday? Common Table Expressions (CTEs) can make these tasks (and many others) so much more manageable, you'll wonder how you ever got along without them. CTEs are a very useful method for abstracting data access in most of the popular relational database platforms (MS SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, DB2). This session will walk through syntax and implementation of CTEs in MS SQL Server. We will then focus on their practical uses, including self-joins, taking advantage of windowing functions, removing duplicates from data sets, and recursion.

##Title: Reducing the impact of database changes on an app##
 
**Abstract**:
The session is about domain driven development. It seems most ORM frameworks being out there do not really solve the abstraction problem between the two as these are table centric. Do such really follow SOA principles when it comes to treating the db? Empower your next project with... server side ORM. I will let you deeply rethink what you've done so far. My approach let me save days or weeks of otherwise wasted development hours when it comes to "make a change". You might feel ORM of your choice seem let you kickstart the project faster, but then... every major change and tweak here and there is a nightmare (refactor, recompile, retest, redeploy). Rewriting an app after every change is like working one step forward, two step backwards.

##Title: Technical Debt with Woody Pewitt##
 
**Abstract**:
Technical debt is the cost of putting off good development practices. This debt must be paid back to avoid the “interest payments” becoming crippling. This presentation will focus on a number of common developer (and project) anti-patterns that can lead to the buildup of technical debt in a project and, having identified these behaviors, we’ll look at techniques to firstly quantify and then to mitigate against them.

##Title: Address Quality – What you don’t know can cost you##
 
**Abstract**:
Address data is one of the most common type of contact information found in databases. In this session, we will examine some underlying factors that affect address correctness and build the business case for having good address data. We will touch on how having correct addresses affects all aspects of data quality from matching to enrichment. Handling data is one thing, but knowing your data and understanding the risks are the first step to managing good quality data. Come hear about what you don’t know on Address and Data Quality – it might be costing you.

##Title: 10 Things all BI Administrators Should Know##
 
**Abstract**:
Conversations about SQL Server administration tends to be all about administering OLTP systems. If you administrate BI systems, you can't apply everything you know about administering OLTP systems to BI systems. BI systems usually end up being administered by OLTP DBAs or by BI developers and architects. Where does one even find a BI Administrator? Fortunately, I've been administering BI systems for several years, and I have learned the hard way the difference between administering OLTP and BI systems. This session will cover the top 10 things that I think an administrator of BI systems need to know.

##Title: Find Bad Queries: Profiler, DMVs, Extended Events##
 
**Abstract**:
Learn how I find high cost queries using the SQL Server 2008 tools. DMV's are great for finding a lot of problems fast. But, sometimes you still need Profiler. I will discuss cases where the DMV's are all you need. I will also discuss how to get information from Profiler that is missing from the DMV data. Extended Events are powerful and will be a major tool in the future of troubleshooting. I will explain why we need Extended Events to solve problems in addition to DMV's and Profiler.

##Title: Avoid Errors on Errors##
 
**Abstract**:
Did you know that when SQL encounters an error of Severity 11 (or higher), there a 4 different ways it can react? Learn how to predict the Error Action or control it. This is possible with or without structured error handling. See both ways to control the outcome. This is a very common workplace faux pas and a Microsoft Certification topic for Dev and Admins. We will use lessons from SQL Programming Joes 2 Pros Vol4.

##Title: Basic Performance Tips and Gotchas##
 
**Abstract**:
Forget Profiler for a second, I have seen one poorly placed index bring an enterprise database to its knees. We will cover the basic tips of performance which always work and the ones which always fail. What can you do – and what should you do –when it comes to the most common types of indexes so you always make the right move. We will use lessons from SQL Architecture Joes 2 Pros Vol3.

##Title: Replication Magic: Initializing From Backups##
 
**Abstract**:
If you work with very large databases (VLDBs) that must be replicated, you should be using initialization from backup. There are a some misconceptions the have caused DBAs to assume that they could not use initialization from backup. In this session I will explore those misconceptions and prove that they are incorrect.

Demos will include initializing a subscriber from a transaction log backup and performing a partial restore of a database and initializing the subscriber from the partial backup.

##Title: Understanding Parameter Sniffing##
 
**Abstract**:
Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.

##Title: Inside the SQL Server Query Optimizer##
 
**Abstract**:
The SQL Server Query Optimizer is a cost-based optimizer: it analyzes a number of candidate execution plans for a given query, estimates the cost of each of these plans, and selects the plan with the lowest cost. In this session I will go into the internals of the Query Optimizer and will show you the steps that it performs in the background covering everything from the time a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated. Why query optimization is an inherently complex problem and why challenges in some of its most fundamental areas are still being addressed today will be covered as well.

##Title: SQL Server Clustering 101##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will cover the basics and delve into the advanced techniques which can be used to cluster Windows servers using the Windows Cluster Service, what sort of protection this provides you, and how to properly set up your clusters for a rock solid environment which will last you for many years to come.  We will start with planning our cluster configuration, selecting our software, and walk through the process of clustering two servers together into an active passive cluster.  We will cover the differences between a standalone machine and clusters with regard to licensing and multiple instance configurations.

##Title: Working with spatial data in SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:

##Title: SQL Server Analysis Services: a 10,000-foot view##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) began life as OLAP Services in SQL Server 7, over a decade ago. Since then there have been major architectural enhancements and SSAS now plays a central role in Micorosoft's Business Intelligence (BI) platform.

This session will describe major SSAS functionality, with demos to illustrate key features. We'll also examine the new SSAS features in SQL Server 2008 R2 and preview the SSAS Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) being introduced in "Denali", the next version of SQL Server.

##Title: Aspect EntityFramework for SqlAzure best practices##
 
**Abstract**:
When talking to Sql Azure there are some best practices you are supposed to follow.  Things like batching and retrying on connection failure.  There are well documented ways to do this using ADO.NET.  However more and more applications are being written using Entity Framework rather than ADO.NET.  If we are using Entity Framework how do we follow those best practices?

##Title: SQL Server on VMware, what a DBA should know##
 
**Abstract**:
Many of our customers are either virtualizing databases or planning to do so soon. I hear from many groups that attempted running their database on VMware but went back to physical hardware because of performance issues. There are many reasons this may have happened, but quite often the decision to go back to physical was not based on hard facts. This presentation will explore the fundamentals of monitoring databases running in a VMware environment. If you are using classic O/S monitoring tools, you may be getting misleading data. Understand what metrics are important and how to get to that data.

##Title: What is "Project Apollo"?##
 
**Abstract**:
Project Apollo introduces Columnstore index in Denali. Columnstore
index can potentially improve data warehouse query performance on
large fact tables (star joins and aggregation) by creating a highly
compressed architecture. It utilizes the same vertipaq algorithm used
by Powerpivot.  Only the data for the columns selected in the query is
brought into memory. Columnstore index is recommended primarily for
read-only workloads.The demo will include scenarios which will benefit
from using columnstore index and will highlight best practices for
using columnstore index.

##Title: SSIS in Denali##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will cover new features of SSIS in Denali in three main areas: the development experience, the deployment experience and the maintenance experience.  We will show the results of migrating an existing 2008 SSIS solution that uses package configurations, parent/child package execution and custom logging to Denali.  I will compare the new tools to 2008 and will also throw in useful tidbits of SSIS knowledge that I have. If you develop, deploy or maintain SSIS packages then you will take away something positive from the presentation
