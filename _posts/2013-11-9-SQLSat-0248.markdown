##Title: Introducing Cube World To Users From Flat Table Land##
 
**Abstract**:
This session explores the tabular approach to building cubes in SQL Server Analysis Services 2012 for those DBAs and developers who are more comfortable working with relational databases than cubes. Starting with a ‘normal’ relational database, the attendee will learn how to build a basic model by loading data from several data sources, establish relations between these data sources, define measures and dimensions, build hierarchies, create KPIs and deploy functional cubes that can be used to answer management’s questions about what is really going on with their data. For users already familiar with PowerPivot, this session provides a good transition into the world of SSAS as both use essentially the same techniques.

##Title: Design and Implement BI like Edison! ##
 
**Abstract**:
As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor.  In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence.

##Title: Forget "Big Data" ! How About "Smart Data" Instead?##
 
**Abstract**:
There’s no denying that Big Data is here to stay, and that society will ultimately be transformed in many ways as a result of its impact. But while Big Data might be 'the next big thing', most companies, no matter what size, would probably do better to focus first on fully utilizing non-big-data BI to address the core challenges of any company, which include: leadership, management, and motivation. In this presentation, I’ll be reviewing three uses of "traditional BI" that are often under-employed and which can be transformational for a business in their own right. For this, I'll be sharing examples, practical tips, and stories from my own experiences at my organization, coupon-giant Valpak.

##Title: Heterogeneous Data Environments##
 
**Abstract**:
Analyzing data across multiple sources for a 360 degree view of your business
 
Not only is the size of data growing, but so are the number of data sources and the number of requests from the business to analyze it. Today’s data professionals are now required to access a myriad of relational and non-relational sources, mash it up together and provide in-depth reports and visualizations, and usually without a lot of time. In this session, product evangelist Peter Evans will show you how Toad can dramatically reduce time spent on accessing relational and non-relational data, simplify data integration, and how to collaborate with other users for a 360 degree view of your business.

##Title: Tuning Analysis Services Processing Performance##
 
**Abstract**:
You’ve got your Analysis Services cube created, and deployed in production. However, you notice that every night, the cube is taking longer and longer to process, and users are starting to complain about their data not being ready when they arrive in the morning. If you’ve found yourself in this situation, or want to avoid being in it in the first place, come to this session. We’ll cover how to benchmark processing performance, track down bottlenecks, and how to tune things to get the best performance for processing your cube.

##Title: A Matter of Time... In SSAS##
 
**Abstract**:
Ever as yourself what time of day it is? Like what time of day does our support desk get the most cases? What are my average sales per hour? When do I need to add more staff, or even perhaps am I over staffed? There are many situations in which being able to slice your data by time of day would be valuable. In this session we will review how to setup a time key and time dimension, configure it in an OLAP cube, and discuss implementing in a tablular model.

##Title: Virtualizing our Environment##
 
**Abstract**:
This session will describe our journey to convert our cluttered, underutilized, power draining physical hosts to a sleek virtualized environment.  This session will also provide some VMware high level architecture, terms and concepts, and a look at vSphere (VMware admin console).  I'll discuss the differences between virtual and physical host metrics and issues surrounding them.  We'll discuss some virtualization shortcomings and then show a little about Confio's Ignite and how it can help DBAs achieve virtualization and not lose visibility of their physical layer.

##Title: Using Excel 2010 as Your Analysis Services Client##
 
**Abstract**:
Self service BI can be a snap even when you build your data models in SQL Server Analysis Services by using PowerPivot for Excel to compress, query and report on the data.  This session will begin by showing how to create a cube in Analysis Services and then connect that cube to PowerPivot for Excel. Once in PowerPivot, we will see how to connect this data to other data sources and augment the cube data with calculated DAX expressions.  We will close by showing from a user's point-of-view how easy it is to manipulate the data to create a variety of different reports and charts with no code.

##Title: 5 TSQL Commands I've been missing##
 
**Abstract**:
Being a full-stack .NET developer, I have written my fair share of T-SQL, but not until I became an accidental DBA did I find a new world of T-SQL options available to me.   In this session, I will go over a five T-SQL commands available since SQL Server 2005 and up that I have been completely missing.  We will evaluate the usefulness of  CTE, OUTPUT, MERGE, APPLY, and RANKING FUNCTIONS and how each of these can replace common cases you see everyday.

##Title: Handling Errors and Data Anomalies in SSIS##
 
**Abstract**:
Even in the most reliable ETL system, it's eventually going to happen: A package will fail, an output row count won't match what is expected, a data anomaly will force a forensic search of the package infrastructure... In this session, we'll talk about some of the things that can go wrong during package execution - and some of the defenses that can be built into SSIS to help head off those errors (or at least make the errors easier to troubleshoot). From error handlers to package restartability, and from logging methods to row count validation and remediation, we'll cover various ways to keep your ETL flowing when problems arise.

##Title: SELECT job FROM firm WHERE hired = 'Yes' 2.0##
 
**Abstract**:
Find out what hiring managers really want to see throughout the hiring process.  This session will walk through the basics that every successful candidate should know:  Resume tips, Job search and Interview tips.  Yes, recruiters and hiring managers view your LinkedIn page; but, did you realize they also view your twitter account, your blog, your Facebook and that webpage you designed freshman year in college?  If you are in a job search, considering one or just want to be prepared for one, then this session will be a great opportunity to find out what "they" are really looking for.
