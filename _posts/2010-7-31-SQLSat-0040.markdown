##Title: Change Data Capture a tool for BI,DR,Audit  more##
 
**Abstract**:
Change Data Capture (CDC) is one of the newest features available for SQL Server 2008 which allows you to easily track and keep history of all DML (Data Manipulation Language) changes on user tables such as INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE without additional overhead. One of the most important benefits of this feature is that it allows you to see the data before  after an UPDATE statement which allows you to recover data overwritten or deleted quickly without the need of a database restore.

On this presentation we will go over the steps necessary to configure CDC and do an overview of some real world scenarios where this feature can be applied such as Business Intelligence, Disaster Recovery, Auditing, Debugging, Documentation and more.

##Title: SQL and SEO - More Money Per Query##
 
**Abstract**:
Bringing marketing together with technology is a fine art that involves high tech tools, real life solutions, and most important human buy-in from the marketing and IT departments. This lecture will delve into the use of the latest SQL Server 2005 and SQL Server 2008 technologies including recursive common table expressions (CTE), hierarchical data models, and CLR stored procedures for the IT side of the house while also delving into the use of analytics, webmaster monitoring tools, web marketing tactics and search engine optimization techniques for the more marketing minded. Neither SQL nor SEO are four letter words and they go together perfectly! So too can your IT and marketing departments as you tackle the new age of IT Marketing.

##Title:  Database design with performance in mind##
 
**Abstract**:
One of the biggest benefits of SQL Server is simplicity. Developer creates a database, write a few T-SQL statements and everything is up and running.. until the system grows up and starts to introduce performance problems. And infinite loop begins: Refactor -> Deploy -> Refactor -> Deploy ->.. In a few years developer has gray hairs and ton of experience. 

The purpose of this session is sharing this experience helping to avoid some of the typical issues for the systems working under heavy load. The session gives the overview of how SQL Server stores data, what criteria Query Optimizer uses choosing the index, how data is locking - essential knowledge when you expect system to handle thousands transactions per second.

##Title: BLITZ! One Hour SQL Server Takeovers##
 
**Abstract**:
You're minding your own business in your corner office - well, no, you're a DBA, so it's just your cubicle - when somebody says, "Did you know about this SQL Server over here?" Suddenly, you have to find out what the server's doing, how it was set up, and whether things are working correctly. In this real-time session, Brent will show you how he tackles unknown servers in 60 minutes to find problems, take an inventory, and set the server up for easier management down the road.

##Title: Creating a C# Runtime Dynamic SSIS Designer##
 
**Abstract**:
SSIS enables us to quickly create deployable packages to move/manipulate data. Things do however get a bit challenging when source and destination tables are not known at package design time or when a requirement exists to have an already-deployed package support schema changes in source tables. One solution to this problem is to leverage our ability to create and execute an SSIS package dynamically in code.

In this session we will take a look at a complete project for a C# Runtime SSIS Package Designer, taking as input a set of table names and dynamically generating both destination Access tables then creating, validating, saving and executing an SSIS Package at runtime with logging enabled to demonstrate the various package steps.

##Title: The DBA Script Thumb##
 
**Abstract**:
This session will present a top 10 (maybe 20) list of queries and tools that DBAs can use daily. The idea is that everything is included on a single 1G or less thumb drive to be portable. From simple T-SQL statements to full blown SSIS packages, the session demonstrates how to interogate, diagnose, report on, and resolve issues that are most prevalent for DBAs: disk space, security, backup locations, database and server documentation, performance and much more. All queries, which are SQL 2000, 2005 and yes even 2008 tried and true will be made available in the session to copy to your own thumb drive. If you are lucky you might even receive a free coveted thumb to store the queries.

##Title: Log Shipping vs. Replication; the Great Debate##
 
**Abstract**:
Many SQL Server DBA's are tasked with the responsibility of choosing an appropriate disaster recovery, reporting, or failover solution for their organization.  Much of the time the choice comes down to replication versus log shipping.  And while both solutions can be extremely effective, there are both subtle  major differences between them that can guide you to choose one over the other.  This presentation gets to the nuts and bolts of the two technologies, and helps you make an educated recommendation and implementation.

On my blog I've started a project called SQL University aimed at folks looking to learn SQL Server from the ground up. This session will start at ground level tasks and resources all database professionals should know (we won't be covering basic T-SQL in this session, just tasks and concepts).

##Title: Getting familiar with Query Optimizer##
 
**Abstract**:
Why my queries are so slow? Why SQL does not use that index? What "Hash Match" means? Do we really need to upgrade the hardware? 

It's essential to know how query optimizer works if you want to design effective solutions. This session will give you an overview of how query optimizer generates query plans, how to read them, how SQL Server executes queries and show a few optimization tricks.

##Title: SQL Server Memory Deep Dive ##
 
**Abstract**:
Like the title says, be prepared to get really down and dirty with memory allocations and usage in SQL Server. RAM is one of the three pillars of server performance and understanding how it is used, how you can analyze what is going on with it and how to properly adjust the the few knobs you have at your disposal are very important topics for both your server's health and performance.

##Title: Parallel Query Execution Deep Dive##
 
**Abstract**:
What exactly does it mean to parallelize a query? Why would the optimizer do this and what are the benefits and what are the drawbacks?? Is it always faster? Can it cause problems? Are there reasons we might NOT want parallelization? These are some of the topics we will cover as we dig into this facet of the SQL Server relational engine.

##Title: Dynamically Configuring SSIS Packages##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, youâ€™ll learn how to control your SSIS packages in a more powerful way by using expressions. The expression language is a bit of an elusive language that can be used to make any component in SSIS dynamic. Then, youâ€™ll learn how to use configuration files to externalize the configuration of your package and lastly how to pass variables into a package. Also learn how to use parent child packages and environment variables.

##Title: PowerShell for the Data Professional##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will learn to perform several everyday DBA tasks like backing up user databases, scripting table objects and evaluating disk space usage with PowerShell. For each tasks we will explore the benefits is using PowerShell over the standard method. Only a basic understanding of PowerShell or DOS is needed. This session should serve as a good introduction to PowerShell for database users. The goal is to get data professionals feet wet about PowerShell.

##Title: Building a Shard for SQL Azure using .NET 4.0##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session I will discuss what it takes to build a shard against SQL Azure. Shards allow developers to access data across a farm of SQL Server or SQL Azure databases transparently. This session places a strong focus on C# and evaluates .NET 4.0 and shows you how to leverage the Task Parallel Library (TPL) and the new Caching namespace to achieve greater performance access SQL Azure. View http://enzosqlshard.codeplex.com/ for information about this shard.

##Title: Don't Be Trigger Happy: Safe Use of Triggers##
 
**Abstract**:
Triggers can be a handy tool in the toolbox, but many times they are used improperly because of a lack of understanding of how they work.  This session will give an overview of the different types of triggers available in SQL Server and then will focus on specifically on the safe use of DML triggers.  We will talk about when to use triggers and touch on other options.  I will demonstrate of both safe and unsafe triggers.
