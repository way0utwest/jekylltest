##Title: Advancing Data Storage: How Flash-Optimized Storag##
 
**Abstract**:
Advancing Data Storage:
How Flash-Optimized Storage Architectures 
Accelerate Performance and Simplify Storage Management

This presentation will explore the evolution of storage architectures over the past 25 years, reviewing the technology inflection points and core business drivers that have propelled the transitions from direct attached to monolithic to modular storage solutions.  

We are at the beginning of the next major technology inflection driving enterprise storage. Solid state drives (SSDs) promise to solve the performance challenges inherent in spinning disks, rendering traditional storage architectures obsolete.    

But SSDs by themselves are not the solution. The next decade will be dominated by storage architectures

##Title: Dive into the Query Optimizer-Undocumented Insight##
 
**Abstract**:
This 400 (or maybe 500) level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.

##Title: Chart Anatomy 101 ##
 
**Abstract**:
SSRS Charts are the next common report item you will use in designing business reports after the Tablix. In this session, we'll deep dive together into the anatomy of a chart: chart elements, properties, and areas. We'll review the drastic improvements Microsoft has made to chart visualization and mimick some of the awesome features found in Power View, Microsoft's new reporting client in SQL Server 2012. Based on visualization fundamentals by renowned data viz expert Stephen Few, I will share with you some ground rules and how to apply them when designing reports in SSRS 2008 R2.

##Title: Mobile BI with SSRS and SharePoint##
 
**Abstract**:
Today's executives and information workers want to use mobile devices to get at their business information, make critical decisions, and thrive. Let's help them get there with SQL Server Reporting Services and SharePoint. Tablets are common place now, and smart phones have been in place for years, but have we devoted enough attention to make effective use of the new form factors? Let's discuss how our design approach changes when we want to launch mission-critical dashboards and reports on smaller screen sizes using touch-screen technology. We'll look at iPad and other mobile devices, SSRS and SharePoint, BI Developer and Business User, with emphasis on data visualization best practices.

##Title: Private Clouds with SQL Server 2012##
 
**Abstract**:
The recent growth of cloud computing has companies evaluating when  how, not if, they will move their data offsite. Despite the benefits that the cloud, many DBAs are leery of jumping into the cloud, fearful that their sensitive data will become vulnerable. The goal of this session is to provide you a blueprint to design  build your own SQL Server cloud, where you can control the server availability  performance reliability, yet still take advantage of the resource elasticity and hardware flexibility of the cloud. In this session, I will demonstrate how to use features like always on, resource governor, policy based management  PowerShell scripts to automate your servers behavior to achieve the benefits of the cloud without the risks

##Title: SQL Server 2012 PowerView - What's missing?##
 
**Abstract**:
As part of the new SQL 2012 release there is a powerful tool called Power View. lt integrates with SharePoint 2010 to provide a easy to use tool to manipulate SQL Server Analysis Services data into beautiful charts and graphs. There's one problem... it's missing a few things that our client
(and probably many others) needed.
 
ln this session I will show how we utilized custom
development, Open XML 2.0. and a few other tools to remedy the problem.

##Title: Scalling your cloud database with SQL Federation##
 
**Abstract**:
With more and more companies moving to a cloud solution, the necessity to easily and efficiently scale their database solution is critical. This session will discuss how to scale SQL Azure using SQL Azure Federations, a recent addition to SQL Azure that provides the ability to build scalable, elastic, and multi-tenant solutions in SQL Azure. SQL Azzure Federations bring the sharding pattern into SQL Azure as a first class citizen as a way to achieve greater scalability and performance from the database tier of your application through horizontal partitioning at the database level. This session will look at Federations from a real-world point of view, by applying Federations to a real-life database. We will also look at performance benefits.

##Title:  Proactive Administration with Ring Buffers.##
 
**Abstract**:
Ring buffers were added in SQL Server 2005. They provide diagnostic data that can be used to troubleshoot server issues such as memory and CPU pressure. By storing this wealth of information in SQL Server, we can spot problems/trends and even resolve problems automatically without having to page the on-call DBA to fix it. In this session, we'll take a look at what ring buffers provides and also what we can do with the data. I'll show you a scenario that recently occurred in my environment and what I did to correct the problem before customers were even aware of it. The tool that I wrote can easily be placed in your environment and adapted to your needs.

##Title: Working With XML In SQL Server ##
 
**Abstract**:
XML is a technology that Developers and DBAs alike share a love-hate relationship with; it's powerful and flexible yet it can be bloated and difficult to work with at the same time. Regardless, XML has found a home in many applications - including SQL Server (e.g. execution plans) - so it's important to understand how to work with it in your databases. This session will show you how to use the XML data type, perform basic operations on XML data, and how to use FOR XML to create XML from relational data. This isn't a session to convince you to use XML, but to show you what you can do with XML when you do need to use it!

##Title: Building Your Own SQL Server Virtual Playground##
 
**Abstract**:
As the number of SQL Server versions and features grow over time so does the the difficulty in maintaining a set of tools for working with all of them on your local machine. Add in that some features require multiple physical instances and suddenly a single installation isn't enough. Need to quickly switch between versions and editions of SQL Server? Want to learn how to set up a cluster? Or maybe you want to try out the latest features in SQL 2012...virtualization offers a convenient way to do any or all of these. In this session we'll show you how by covering the fundamentals of desktop virtualization and demonstrating how to set up a virtual playground on your own machine.

##Title: Agile Data Warehousing with WhereScape##
 
**Abstract**:
This is introduction to WhereScape RED, an agile development environment – building high quality data warehouses native to SQL 2008, R2, 2012 quickly.  No other toolset can beat the productivity which results in a consistent, scalable, supportable and fully documented data warehouse.

##Title: Discovering the Plan Cache##
 
**Abstract**:
Execution plans are stored after execution in the plan cache. This metadata about how queries are executed can provide insight into how your SQL Server environment is functioning. By using XQuery to browse and search the plan cache you can find potential performance issues and opportunities to tune your queries. This information can be used to help reduce issues related to parallelism, shift queries from using scans to using seek operations, or discover exactly which queries are using what indexes. All of this and more is readily available through the plan cache. In this session we will explore the plan cache and start you on the road to discovery.

##Title: Parallel Query Plans - Good and Bad##
 
**Abstract**:
I will review the basics of Parallel Query Plans and discuss a variety of issues. Single CPU query plans can be very complicated. Multi CPU plans add another layer of complexity. There are benefits to using more than 1 CPU to run a query faster but there are also pitfalls. Why do some high cost queries only use 1 CPU? What about CXPACKET? Why can a parallel plan query run slower than the same query using only 1 CPU?  All new computers have multiple CPU cores. This has increased the relevance of parallel plan query execution.If you have questions or stories of parallel plan issues, please share your questions and experiences during this talk.

##Title: Exploring SQL Server Data Tools##
 
**Abstract**:
With the release of SQL Server 2012, Microsoft released a new tool called SQL Server Data Tools.  Now you are probably thinking at this point, another tool, why would I need this.  If that is you then you should probably come to this session.  SQL Server Data Tools has a number of great features that not only make your SQL Server code development easier such as easier code navigation, intellisense and debugging.  In addition, the tool allows you to target multiple versions of SQL Server including cloud based instances.  Lastly, the use of projects can enable you store your database schema in source control and migrate to generating builds.

##Title: SQL Server Table Partitioning from the ground up##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will be looking at the SQL Server table partitioning features which were introduced in SQL Server 2008.  We will 

look at how to create partitioned tables and indexes as well as the internals of the table.  We will also look at how to move data 

from one partition to another and from one table to another with minimal to no impact to the users.

##Title: Up Your Game With OUTPUT##
 
**Abstract**:
There are some classic database programming tasks that rely on answering the question "What did I just change?" Prior to SQL Server 2005, we had to use functions like SCOPE_IDENTITY() and some extra tricks for handling multiple rows. Some people even had to resort to triggers. Yikes!! This session focuses on the practical use cases for the T-SQL OUTPUT clause. More importantly, you will find out how you can ditch the tricks of the past for a simpler solution that will help keep you sane.
