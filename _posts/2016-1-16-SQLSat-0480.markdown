## Title: Data Pages, Allocation Units, IAM chains... Oh My!
 
**Abstract**:
Understanding how SQL Server stores your data can seem like a daunting task. In this session You'll learn how objects such as tables and indexes are stored in a data file. We’ll also look at how these concepts tie in to your work as a DBA or developer. We’ll see these concepts in action using demos and see how we can use this knowledge to better design solutions.

We’ll start off by looking at the structure of a row and then move on the concept of a data page. From there we’ll cover a few special page types like the index allocation map and GAM and SGAM pages. Then we’ll look at index structures and talk about the differences between heaps and clustered indexes.

## Title: Execution Plans for Mere Mortals
 
**Abstract**:
As a beginner database professional, execution plans are intimidating. In this  session, I will take you through the basics of reading graphical execution plans and drill into key operators, warnings and properties.

You will understand how, why and when the execution plan will be created and saved to plan cache.

Reading the execution plan will be much less intimidating as we walk through the flow and process of a graphical execution plan. 

After looking at the key operators, you will be able to analyze the operators of your execution plans, view the operator properties, and identify common performance tuning opportunities.

Finally, you will be able to capture the execution plan, save it for analysis and comparison after modifications have occurred.

## Title: Flying Through the Clouds--Performance Tuning in Azure
 
**Abstract**:
So between your management and Microsoft, it’s been decided that you are moving your SQL Server workloads to the cloud. Whether it’s Microsoft Azure SQL Database or running SQL Server in a VM, there are unique performance tuning challenges that are different in a cloud environment. Just like when you moved your SQL Servers from physical to virtual environments, you will learn new techniques for tuning workloads. In this session you will learn about:

•	Optimizing TempDB in an Azure VM
•	Reducing latency between application VMs and database VMs
•	Right sizing Azure VMs for performance and cost
•	Striping I/O across devices in Azure VMs
•	Performance Tuning in Azure DB

You will learn about techniques that will not just improve your system performance, but save you company money, which can be easily quantified just in time for your performance review.

## Title: SSAS Metadata Reporting for Cube Consumers and Developers
 
**Abstract**:
You've made that big investment in developing several (or hundreds) of SSAS cubes.  Now, how do you provide your users with information regarding cube structures, hierarchies and attributes, measures, etc.?  And what if your cube developers want to know things like which attributes in a model have specific properties set (or not set)?  During this session, we'll explore a reporting solution developed to provide SSAS metadata information to cube consumers and developers alike.  By using SSIS, the AMO object model, and SSRS, we'll build a system that gathers SSAS metadata and makes that available via a set of reports to create a catalog of cubes, drill-down reports showing dimension/hierarchy/attribute information, etc.

## Title: Mastering and Enhancing Company Data
 
**Abstract**:
Getting a good 360 degree view of organizations (customers or vendors) or doing customer centric analysis is often complicated as a result of bad data/ duplicate data / inconsistent data coming from multiple systems. In addition, there are external factors like mergers and acquisitions, inter-company relationships and other nuances that may not be captured in source systems. Getting a clear picture of customer and vendor data can not only provide a clear picture for analysis of information, but also aid in critical risk management functions. In this session, you will learn about some techniques and data services from DB that you can use to clean and enhance your data.

## Title: PowerShell for the Reluctant Administrator
 
**Abstract**:
You've heard many people claim that PowerShell is fabulous, but you've never really felt the need for it. What's all the fuss? What is PowerShell and why should you even care, much less learn it? How will this new toy make your work easier?

This session will help you understand what PowerShell is, how it integrates into the tools you know and love, and how it can help make your everyday work go faster and more smoothly. Along with the background on PowerShell, you'll see some simple but useful tools and ideas for how you can use those tools and make your own tools too.

This session was designed for the non-PowerShell user and the new PowerShell user. It is intended to help people start to use PowerShell, and it will touch on advanced ideas but only assumes only basic scripting/coding experience like understanding a variable, a loop, etc.

## Title: XML Without Xanax: How to Handle XML in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Do you cringe whenever you have to look at an XML document? Does the very thought of XML data living in your database make you scream? Do you have a panic attack any time you have to parse XML? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this session is for you!

We'll start with reasons why having XML in SQL Server might be a good thing, then we'll face our fears and turn tabular data into XML, and finally we'll confront the true source of our anxiety by parsing XML back into tabular data using xQuery.

If you survive this session, you'll have faced your fears about XML in SQL Server, you'll have a solid understanding of creating XML from tabular data, and you'll know how to use xQuery to parse XML.

## Title: Don't Rely on Magic - Tabular Performance Troubleshooting 
 
**Abstract**:
Many times you'll hear that one of the major advantages of using the tabular model is ease of use and implementation.  So that must mean that it will run like a super fast dream all the time out of the box, forever and ever right?  Not exactly.  There are many things to consider at the time of modeling and implementation for performance.  And later if you run into trouble with reports and queries, what do you do then?  In this session we'll go through the process to troubleshoot performance of your tabular models and queries to keep things running as fast as possible.  Just because tabular is easy to use doesn't mean you have a magical black box that you can't tune when it doesn't run as fast as you want.  In this session, we will focus on building a methodology for troubleshooting tabular performance so you can get that super fast dream machine.

## Title: Turning Requirements into a BI Prototype
 
**Abstract**:
Your SQL Server system can support two types of Analysis Services models: multidimensional or tabular. But what if you’ve never implemented them and your company wants to start using BI? Are you wondering how to get started? Regardless of which type of SSAS model you want to use, the best first step is to determine what types of questions your BI solution should answer. Next, determine how to structure your data. Before you begin the physical restructuring of your data, though, you should validate your proposed design by creating a prototype that users can review with you. In this session you’ll learn how to translate the business questions to be answered by your solution into a functional prototype that can steer your development efforts in the right direction.

## Title: Version control with GIT for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
In 2005, Linus Torvalds developed the version control system (VCS) git. Since then, it has become as platform agnostic and ubiquitous as the internet. In that same note, github, the most popular service for hosting git repositories has become so ubiquitous that Microsoft chose to host the source code for its OSS fork of the .NET framework there instead of its own codeplex.

What does this mean to a DBA? Whether or not you use SSDT, you should be storing your database schema in version control. In addition, your utility scripts certainly belong in VCS. 

In my session. We'll cover:

What is version control?
How does a distributed version control system differ from traditional version control like Visual Sourcesafe, TFS, and SVN?
How do I setup git for internal use in my company?
How do I host public and private repositories on github.
How do pull requests work?
How do I fork a SVN repo to github?

We will be covering using git from both the command line and Visual Studio.

## Title: Parameter Sniffing and the Query Store in SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
Troubleshooting performance problem (particularly related to parameter sniffing) is one of the most challenging and most often faced situation in a DBA’s life. In SQL Server 2016, Microsoft has come up with an Interesting tool called the “Query Store”. The Query Store records everything about query compilations and execution statistics. It collects and presents detailed historic information about all queries in a simplified way and reduces the time required to diagnose and resolve issues faster, even allowing you to observe changes in query performance over time. In this presentation, I will provide an overview of the Query Store and discuss its features, benefits, and implementation

## Title: Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!
 
**Abstract**:
Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!

## Title: Surviving Your Peak Database Load
 
**Abstract**:
Each application and system is different, but all have a similar quality: there will be times where the systems are used more, and other times where they may appear to be sleeping. Good examples are monthly, quarterly, and yearly for financial systems and the holiday season for retail. The last thing you want to have in these timeframes is your CxO standing at your desk wondering why things are slow or possibly down. Ensuring that your SQL Servers are optimally configured for those heavy usage periods cannot be done with a wing and a prayer – you need an actionable, realistic plan. This session will discuss how to guarantee that your SQL Server instances and the configurations they use are as scalable and reliable as possible.

## Title: Let Me Finish... Isolating Write Operations
 
**Abstract**:
OLTP databases can be constantly written to and reporting databases are written to at least periodically. In order to ensure consistent results, connections must be isolated from one another while executing, ideally with the lowest possible cost to concurrency.  How this isolation is handled is based on the isolation level, whether the classic lock based or the newer optimistic scheme of the in-memory OLTP engine is used, or even if both engines are enlisted in the same transaction. In this session we will look at examples of how SQL Server isolates reading and writing operations from other writing operations to explore how this may affect your application through error messages and performance hits.

## Title: Data Architecture 101
 
**Abstract**:
This presentation is a quick introduction for the DBA or developer who was just told that their boss promised a major new customer a scalable, well designed database. The customer will pay a lot of cash and years of ongoing business using this database… If you deliver it this week!

You’ll get a big bonus if you build this right, but you also remember what your co-workers did to the person who bungled the last database design… and wonder if that designer ever recovered! This session will introduce you to the fundamentals of Datatypes, Relational Algebra, and Normalization to help you avoid the major pitfalls and maybe get some sleep too!

## Title: Automating Database Restores
 
**Abstract**:
Beginning DBA's think of a RESTORE as something that gets done when something goes wrong. In practice we restore all the time, perhaps most often to refresh our QA and Development environments. Doing one restore isn't hard, but what about when you get five or ten requests a day? It's not just the restore either, you have to alter permissions, change the recovery model, set the database owner, perhaps update synonyms or mask out sensitive data. Restores are a pattern and if we see the pattern, we can do things to make it faster and repeatable.

This presentation will show you the latest version of the system I use, one consisting of a couple of tables and a couple of Powershell scripts. I'll start with my design goals, show you some of the compromises I made to get to a solution that handles 90% or so of the requests, and some of the options I thought about but decided against. I used Powershell, but  it's a pattern you could solve using another language, even perhaps TSQL!

## Title: Getting Started with MDX
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect, SSAS Maestro and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2012 and most previous versions. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.

## Title: A Real, Live PowerShell Beginner's Tutorial
 
**Abstract**:
This is for the PowerShell precon. The problem I've seen with most PowerShell "beginner's tutorials" is that they almost always go way beyond the basics.
