## Title: Understanding your .NET 4.0 Data Access Options
 
**Abstract**:
The .NET 3.5 SP1 framework gave us Entity Framework (EF), Language-Integrated Query (LINQ), LINQ to SQL (and a variety of other LINQ providers) and ADO.NET Data Services. Now .NET 4.0 sports a revamped EF 4.0 with N-tier support and adds on WCF RIA Services.
 
How to you sort out this chaos? Is conventional ADO.NET dead? Is it possible to bridge the DataSet with Silverlight? How do you build an n-tier Silverlight app using domain services and EF 4.0? Lenni will answer these questions (and more) to help demystify the Microsoft data access juggernaut. We’ll compare the real advantages and disadvantages across this set of technologies so that you can choose the best architecture for your application. Attend this session and develop a clear perspective of .NET data access in today’s world.

## Title: From Mess to Mastery: Managing Large Environments 
 
**Abstract**:
In an era of "do more with less," IT staff are constantly being asked to manage environments without spending money. Worse yet, budgets are being cut for staff and tools. 

IT veteran Mike Hillwig will show you how some of the integrated tools within SQL Server can help you manage your environment without spending a ton of money. We'll look at the Central Management Server, Management Data Warehouse, Multi-Server Administration, and Policy Based Management. Mike will also show you his tips for building an Environment Inventory Database, a tool you can use to track your servers, instances, and login credentials. 

By leveraging what you already have in SQL Server, you'll certainly be able to do more with less.

## Title: HealthySQL 2.0
 
**Abstract**:
Are your SQL Servers Healthy? Are all the SQL Servers you manage, healthy running optimally and has the high availability that is expected? How do you know for sure? Have you checked on the health of your SQL Servers lately? What is a HealthCheck, and how do we perform one? If you are a DBA, then you ought to know! Well Pearl Knows. Robert Pearl talks about the importance of regular health checks of your SQL Server(s). We will talk about the need to create a baseline  provide some time-tested ways to determine if your SQL Servers are healthy and prove it to your managers, clients and heaven forbid, your IT auditors. Using various tools and scripts, you will come out of this session feeling much better :-) Session Level: Beginner Robert Pearl Speaker photo Robert Pearl, President of Pearl Knowledge Solutions, Inc.,  SQL MVP/SME, solutions-oriented Senior DBA with 12+ years of experience.

## Title: Implementing a HIPAA Compliance Strategy with SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
HIPAA puts a lot of responsibility on our companies and compliance can be hard to maintain. Today medical data is more valuable on the black market than a social security number or a credit card.  As DBAs we're charged with the security of our data and thus act as a front line defense.

In this hour long session We'll delve into the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and what implications it has for us as data professionals. We'll discuss SQL Server best practices that can help protect ourselves, our company, and the people whom we serve. We'll also dive into features in SQL Server that can help in this endeavor.

## Title: What the VLF? 
 
**Abstract**:
Experienced DBAs know that SQL Server stores data in data files and transaction log files. What is less commonly known is that the transaction log file is broken up into smaller segments known as Virtual Log Files, or VLFs. 

Having too many VLFs will cause performance to suffer. And having too few will cause backup performance to suffer. How do you strike the right balance?

In this more advanced session, veteran DBA Mike Hillwig will show you what VLFs are, how they're created, how to identify them, and how to strike the right balance between too few and too many.

## Title: Effective use of temporary tables
 
**Abstract**:
Every developer eventually comes against business logic that can’t be handled with a single simple or complex query. TSQL provides the developer with several constructs that can store temporary result sets that are passed to the next query in the script.

I will be covering these various TSQL techniques with examples using the [AdventureWorks] database as well as a toy database called AUTOS. The pros and cons of each construct will be examined. Advanced options like enabling trace flag 1118 will be explored.

## Title: Query Optimization Crash Course
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have users complaining that applications are running "too slow"?  Do your DB traces look like a short story written by monkeys at typewriters?
This is a fun, fast-paced walkthrough of the most effective strategies for query tuning.  We'll investigate the most common causes of sub-optimal queries (and some quite unusual ones) while building a foundation for solving any optimization problem that the application throws your way!

## Title: 7 Great things you can do to improve and manage customer relationships
 
**Abstract**:
In the eyes of accountants, your a cost to a customer, period and end of discussion. So why do I always mention "We are a profit center" to my clients every chance we get? How do you handle a late project? How do you break bad news to a client, (Hint: With good news first). This and other highly effective management techniques are waiting for you at my session. So don't go to another Reporting Services session and instead come and learn how to improve and gain new business...unless you only do reporting services of course.

## Title: SQL Server Compression - Getting More Out of Less
 
**Abstract**:
We are storing more information then we ever have before and we need to retain this information for longer periods of time. Do we keep adding more and more disk space? What about performance? What about cost? Is there some way we can use the existing space more efficiently? With data compression we can tackle these issues and do it with minimal or even no changes to our existing code.

## Title: Monitoring Databases in a Virtual Environment
 
**Abstract**:
When moving databases to a virtual environment the performance metrics DBAs typically use to troubleshoot performance issues such as O/S metrics, storage configurations, CPU allocation and more become unreliable. DBAs no longer have a clear, reliable view of the factors impacting database performance. Understanding the difference between the physical and virtual server environment adds a new dimension to the DBA tasks. This presentation describes the changes that DBAs need to make in their performance and monitoring practices.

## Title: Squeezing Top Performance from Your Virtualized SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Just about anyone can click through a SQL Server installation and get it working, but more than a little  tuning is required to get the most performance out of your servers. Once virtualized, additional tuning can help get even more performance out of that virtual machine. David Klee (@kleegeek) will discuss valuable details for both VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V on how to tweak and tune your virtual infrastructure for business-critical virtualized SQL Servers. Tips on configuring your SQL Server installations for maximum performance when virtualized will be covered in detail.

## Title: Adding User Configurations to an Analysis Server Cube
 
**Abstract**:
Any analysis of a business's operations is going to include some proprietary values or conversion factors that only that industry or particular company will understand. And, it is likely that those values will need to be specific to some aspect of the business. In this session we'll look at several different ways to add user configurable values and conversion factors to an Analysis Server cube. We'll use some advanced T-SQL querying functions to produce a solution that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

**Abstract**:
These are the days of increasing cyber and computer crimes. 
As DBAs and guardians of corporate data, it is your paramount duty to not only prevent any data loss but also discover lost , damaged or sabotaged data.
But how can you do that without destroying evidence? Remember electronic evidence is extremely fragile.
In this the first of the two part session, we will explore the following:
1. Fundamentals of Computer Forensics
2. Tools to use in Computer Forensics--Data Acquisition
3. Processing a crime scene
4. Network Forensics and Live Acquistions.

## Title: DAX and the tabular model
 
**Abstract**:
With the advent of the tabular model in SQL Server 2012, another analytical option has opened to the BI Specialist. We shall be looking at what critical factors should be analyzed prior to opting for the model and that done,  how to extract data from a tabular model using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX).
We shall discuss many of the often used functions, discuss their 'overloads' (utilizing several practical examples) and see how to turn the extracted data into valuable information that may be used by decision makers to help the enterprise achieve its corporate goals.

## Title: Indexing your Data Warehouse
 
**Abstract**:
One of the primary skill sets most database professionals are initially required to “master” is the art of proper indexing in our databases. We learn early on that an effective indexing configuration will go further in making our databases perform efficiently than probably any other single tuning technique. What’s not so commonly discussed though are the varying approaches one may wish to utilize when indexing your SQL Server enterprise data warehouse.  This session will hopefully cause you to take a good look at your current indexing to see if indeed it could be operating even more efficiently.

## Title: Native File Streaming with SQL Server 2012
 
**Abstract**:
In this dynamic session, Lenni will teach you the ins-and-outs of unstructured data storage and native file streaming in SQL Server 2012. Learn all about FILESTREAM, an innovative feature introduced in SQL Server 2008 that integrates the relational engine with the NTFS file system. FILESTREAM revolutionized BLOB storage in the database, and now FileTable, new in SQL Server 2012, builds on FILESTREAM to deliver a logical file system—implemented as a FILESTREAM-enabled table in your database—on top of your BLOBs. Lenni will demonstrate how to program FILESTREAM using T-SQL and, for maximum performance, using the OpenSqlFileStream API in C#.

## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs
 
**Abstract**:
If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.
