The columnstore index is the standard for storing and querying large data warehousing fact tables. It uses column-based data storage and query processing to achieve up to 10x query performance gains in your data warehouse over traditional row-oriented storage, and up to 10x data compression over the uncompressed data size. 
Starting with SQL Server 2016, you can use columnstore indexes for real-time analytics on your operational workload.
