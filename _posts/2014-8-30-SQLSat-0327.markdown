## Title: SQL Best Practices including tips and Tricks for optimizing your SharePoint Farm
 
**Abstract**:
SharePoint has become the defacto EIM tool for many large organisations and this comes with a huge responsibility for SQL DBA’s and BI consultants alike. SQL is the heart and soul of any SharePoint Farm and in this session we will be focussing on:
•	What architectural considerations there are for SQL from SharePoint
•	Real-world SQL requirements for SharePoint
•	Simple tips and tricks for SQL before deploying SharePoint
•	Best practice scenario’s for SQL pertaining to SharePoint
Invariably, SharePoint Architects have to co-exist with SQL DBA’s without having to argue and or debate what is required. DBA’s armed with the items listed above will have a better understanding of SharePoint and will also be able to optimize the performance of SharePoint DB’s so as to ensure better overall performance.

## Title: SQL Server 2014 Data Access Layers
 
**Abstract**:
How often have our SQL Servers been bogged down with a myriad of users issuing lengthy and poorly constructed or poorly performing queries against our tables and views.More often than not,nearly bringing our systems to their knees.Nowhere is this truer than within the financial world where heavy number crunching is par for the course.This beginners to intermediate level hands-on presentation is aimed at the SQL Server developer and business analyst alike and will show the attendee how we had managed to eliminate 90 % of our poorly performing queries by creating a data access layer which provides our end users with a suite of well developed and tuned SQL Server FUNCTIONS and UDT's with which to render their data.

## Title: On Transactions and Atomic Operations
 
**Abstract**:
If there’s one thing that we, as SQL developers, don’t do, it’s use enough transactions.
Transactions are critical when multiple changes need to be made entirely or not at all, but even given that it’s rare to see transactions used at all in most production code.

In this session, we’ll look at what transactions are and why we should use them. We’ll explore the effects transactions have on locking and the transaction log. We’ll investigate methods of handling errors and undoing data modifications, and we’ll see why nested transactions are a lie.
