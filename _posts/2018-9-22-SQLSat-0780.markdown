##Title: ДБА поневоле – что делать? (ru)##
 
**Abstract**:
Часто роль администратора баз данных закрепляется по принципу «может разобраться и имеет на это время», а иногда и просто игнорируется. К сожалению, это приводит к проблемам с производительностью, необоснованным затратам на оборудование, риску потери данных и простою основной деятельности.

Докладчик, в сжатой, но доступной форме на примере СУБД Microsoft SQL Server расскажет и покажет, что необходимо делать новоиспечённым администраторам баз данных, даже если эта роль досталась им поневоле. 

В этой сессии:

1.	Планирование
2.	Инсталляция и настройка
3.	Регулярное обслуживание
4.	Проблемы с производительностью и как их решить
5.	Масштабирование
6.	Построение стратегии восстановления от сбоев
7.	Сторонние утилиты и инструменты

Доклад предназначен для широкой публики не имеющей опыта в администрировании баз данных, а также тем, кому роль ДБА досталась по совместительству.

На русском языке.

##Title: The Road to The Autonomous Databases##
 
**Abstract**:
Autonomous means capable of existing independently. Think maintenance free, self-healing, auto-tuning databases able to detect and automatically mitigate security risks. Sounds like impossible dream, but here is the best part - Azure is gradually making that next level of automation possible. Cloud economy of scale combined with unique features of Azure Sql PaaS resources transform and enhance the way we collect, store and process data. And that also affects our professional lives. Find out where we are on The Road to The Autonomous Databases, what are main building blocks, what kind of obstacles we still have to overcome and how to turn these challenges into opportunities.

##Title: MS SQL Server: JSON##
 
**Abstract**:
Долгое время на Microsoft Connect поддержка работы с JSON была одной из самых востребованных фич, которую добавили в SQL Server 2016. Забегая вперед скажу, что вышло очень даже хорошо, но Microsoft не остановилась на этом и в SQL Server 2017 существенно улучшили производительность и без того быстрого JSON парсера. В рамках сессии мы рассмотрим нюансы работы с JSON и сравним по эффективности с олдскульным XML.

##Title: MS SQL Server: XML, XQuery and Performance Issues##
 
**Abstract**:
При работе с XML существует большое число подводных камней, которые могут приводить к каверзным проблемам с производительностью. В рамках доклада, мы рассмотрим общие рекомендации о том, как можно эффективно хранить, парсить и генерировать XML. Узнаем, когда выгодно использовать XQuery, а в каких случаях лучше проявляет себя OpenXML. Как лучше передавать массивы значений как параметры в хранимки. Научимся парсить огромные XML файлы с помощью XMLBulkLoad. Отдельно рассмотрим баги связанные с парсингом XML, которые Microsoft бережно переносит из версии в версию.

##Title: Analyzing 100 billion rows in 30 seconds with Google BigQuery##
 
**Abstract**:
This session is Intro to Google BigQuery. 
Will give the overview of the architecture and important details

Google BigQuery is a very unique analytics data warehousing service. BigQuery is often described as serverless, no-ops, seamlessly scalable, and fully managed. Since BigQuery truly has no equivalent, it bears mentioning some of the less obvious aspects of what makes BigQuery so amazing!
