## Title: When Database Corruption Strikes
 
**Abstract**:
Your database is running fine month after month with no problems. Suddenly someone reports that their query won’t run. They get an error stating “SQL Server detected a logical consistency-based I/O error", or something even scarier. Do you know what to do now? 

We will walk through three corrupt databases exploring ways to go about finding and fixing the corruption. More importantly we will explore how to prevent further data loss at the time corruption occurs. Learn what things you can do to protect yourself when corruption strikes. Learn how to avoid making things worse, and how to protect your data if things do get worse. You will leave with a checklist of steps to use when you encounter corruption. By the end of this session you will be ready to take on corruption, one database at a time.

## Title: Enhancements that will make your SQL database engine roar!
 
**Abstract**:
Do you want to make your SQL Server engine roar and make it one of the fastest in the planet? If so, then come to this session to learn about new enhancements and advanced tuning and diagnostic options available in SQL Server 2016 database engine. As hardware capabilities increase rapidly, knowing when to use these enhancements and configuration options is extremely important to scale SQL Server for the required application workload throughput rates. 
In the last couple of years, SQL Tiger Team has worked closely with many customers running Tier-1 mission critical workloads to scale their SQL Server with several configuration parameters and application patterns. In this session, you will hear directly from experienced members of the Microsoft SQL Server Tiger Team, about these specific enhancements, configurations, and approaches for scaling SQL Server on the largest hardware systems available in the planet.

## Title: Insider Secrets to Securing the Budget You Need
 
**Abstract**:
How many times has a lack of budget for hardware, training, or expert assistance caused problems for you in designing, implementing, and maintaining a great SQL Server environment?  Come to this session to learn effective ways to secure the budget you need instead of being consistently required to do more with less, or worse – nothing.  The good news is that there are several simple and practical things you can do to vastly improve your ability to get the budget you need when you need it.  You will hear how to think like an executive from someone who was one for many years so you can begin to influence decisions at the right level to get what both you and your SQL Server infrastructure need.

## Title: Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds. I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. 

Here you’ll learn:
• the most useful regular expression commands
• the appropriate times to use regular expressions
• how to use regular expressions to write code for you 
• how to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.

## Title: JSON  SQL Server: using it effectively
 
**Abstract**:
JSON is a de-facto standard for machine-to-machine communication but also to store "liquid" data. Once a killer feature of NoSQL database, with SQL Server 2016 is now available also in a (post) relational environment.
But how it fits in the relational database space? How the usage of JSON can simplify DBAs and DEVs everyday work? What about performances? And what about flexibility? 
In this session we'll see how powerful JSON can be, when used correctly and not abused, providing solution to common problems 
(like in the well known "dynamic schema" case), simplifying development (for example to pass to Stored Procedure complex objects or variable numbers of parameters) with also very good performances, even if they maybe hidden in not-so-obvious places.

## Title: SQL Server 2016 Always On Availability Groups Perf  Internals
 
**Abstract**:
Always On Availability Groups (AGs) were introduced in SQL Server 2012. AGs significantly expanded our HA/DR options. However, in both SQL 2012 and SQL 2014 two limitations were extant in the code—both Network Transport and Log Redo significantly compromised performance. In SQL Server 2016, these limitations have been significantly improved. 

Our work shows enhancements of 7x – 10x, allowing over 1/2GB/s (4Gb/s) across the wire. These improvements expand solutions options for Tier 1 OLTP and Data Warehouse workloads, Tier 1 and Tier 2 consolidation, and more. This presentation explains the improvements, characterizes the new solutions, and shows commodity servers and modern non-shared in-server flash storage showing the profound contrast between SQL Server 2014 vs. 2016. Doing so moves the performance bottleneck from the SQL Server codebase to the CPU where it belongs.

## Title: SQL Server Encryption
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever wanted to know how Transparent Database Encryption (TDE) works or how you set it up? What about encrypting your backups? This session will go over all the steps and caveats that go with this technology. TDE allows you to have your database encrypted on disk and the same Encryption Hierarchy allows you to back up your database and have it encrypt the contents in the backup file.  We will discuss the Encryption Hierarchy which is used for encryption in SQL Server and take you through keeping your secrets safe. We will also go over how Always Encrypted works as well. Master the concepts of SQL Server Encryption when you are done with this session.

## Title: Modern Data Warehousing with Azure SQL DW
 
**Abstract**:
The principles of data warehousing, especially the work of Dr. Ralph Kimball, have been enormously successful for many years.
But are they still relevant to the world of data lakes and big data? And what is the role of a relational database, even massively parallel databases like Azure SQL DW or AWS Redshift? 

This presentation will explore these questions about when the concepts of DW are still relevant, and then cover some implementation details of a Modern DW on Azure SQL DW, including how to maximize performance by minimizing Data Movement (Shuffle Move and PartitionMove operations).

## Title: Availability Groups: What They’re Not Telling You
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2012 brought to life a new form of high availability and disaster recovery in the form of Availability Groups (AGs). This all sounds fantastic, but in reality there are issues and problems that are generally not discussed, or well known, that can impact your HA/DR story and cause major performance issues. In this session, I’ll give a brief overview on AGs in SQL Server 2012 and the enhancements that come in 2014 and 2016. Then we’ll get into some of the problems that exist, that I’ve seen in the real world of using AGs, and that you should be aware of before implementing it in your environment.

## Title: Query Optimization Statistics : Driving Force Behind Performance
 
**Abstract**:
When the SQL Server optimizer evaluates a query to determine how best to execute it, the statistics are quite possibly the most important tool at its disposal. But SQL Server statistics objects aren’t perfect because they only contain summary information. In this session, we’ll start with an overview of what the statistics objects are, how the optimizer uses them, and some general guidelines for their maintenance. Then we’ll look at some of the issues – and solutions –  that can arise due to their imperfection: ascending keys, correlated predicates, skewed distribution, or downright bad summary information.
