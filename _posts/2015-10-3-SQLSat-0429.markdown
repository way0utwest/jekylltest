## Title: Triple Trouble - Running a SQL Failover Cluster on a Cluster from a Cluster
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Failover Clustering has traditionally been deployed on physical architecture for a very long time, and is considered by many to be the optimal architectural deployment even today.

Experienced High Availability implementors and pioneers will remember the Microsoft Cluster Hardware Compatibility List with terror and early Virtualization adopters will recoil in disgust at their memories of poorly performing SQL Server VM deployments and will never want to go back there again. Times are changing and with the introduction of Microsoft's Scalable Shared File Server and improvements to Hyper-V Clustering, High Availability will never be the same again.

In this session we will investigate whether times have really changed for the better and discuss how to implement, administrate and benefits of running a Cluster on a Cluster from a Cluster!

## Title: Introduction to Azure DocumentDB
 
**Abstract**:
Azure DocumentDB is a new highly-scalable NoSQL database platform on Microsoft Azure, designed as a fully managed cloud service for modern web and mobile applications. Like other NoSQL platforms, DocumentDB supports schema-free designs, and scales across replicas with fast write performance and eventual consistency. But DocumentDB also offers several unique features that make it a compelling candidate for NoSQL scenarios, which you will learn about in this session. The platform is based on HTTP/REST, embraces JSON as a standard document format, and is supported by a wide range of SDKs for .NET, JavaScript, Java, Python, and Node.js. Without defining any index paths, new documents are queryable within milliseconds, using SQL grammar or LINQ. Learn these and other capabilities, including server-side JavaScript-based stored procedures, user-defined functions, triggers, tunable consistency, and more.

## Title: Flying Through the Clouds--Performance Tuning in Azure
 
**Abstract**:
So between your management and Microsoft, it’s been decided that you are moving your SQL Server workloads to the cloud. Whether it’s Microsoft Azure SQL Database or running SQL Server in a VM, there are unique performance tuning challenges that are different in a cloud environment. Just like when you moved your SQL Servers from physical to virtual environments, you will learn new techniques for tuning workloads. In this session you will learn about:

•	Optimizing TempDB in an Azure VM
•	Reducing latency between application VMs and database VMs
•	Right sizing Azure VMs for performance and cost
•	Striping I/O across devices in Azure VMs
•	Performance Tuning in Azure DB

You will learn about techniques that will not just improve your system performance, but save you company money, which can be easily quantified just in time for your performance review.

## Title: The Reporting Machine!
 
**Abstract**:
Dashboards and reports can be created always easier and getting better with tools such as SQL Server Reporting Services or Power View. But what do you do if you need to generate more than 600 reports? In different languages, different corporate designs, variable rendering formats and different layouts based on the data of the recipient?

In this demo based session, we will give you a complete overview into a customer project, where we used SSIS, SSRS and MDS to do exactly that.
You will see, how we:

-	import statistical data with R and SSIS
-	stuck report parts together, to get complete reports with almost 100 pages
-	define themes for different corporate designs
-	define languages for different reports
-	render the reports with different rendering extensions
-	developing Office add-ins to automate SSIS, SSRS and MDS

## Title: Curious Cases of Availability Groups
 
**Abstract**:
	It's been more than two years after the release of the AlwaysOn Availability Groups and every day we see more and more architects implementing this technology. Either on new projects or as a new solution on existing systems, at the design stage everything looks feasible and possible, but sometimes small details may cause a headache during the implementation phase. In this session, we will go through common cases, and others not so common, when implementing Availability Groups in a production environment. Dive with me into these AG cases so when one of these situations pops during your professional life you will already be armed with the knowledge to resolve it!

## Title: Learning R through a typical BI task
 
**Abstract**:
R is a language for data munging and stats that is growing in popularity.  Many Microsoft BI professionals are curious about R but few have used it on a real project yet.  This talk aims to introduce you to the capabilities of R by comparing the implementation of a typical BI task both in Power BI and in R.  We’ll load some data from a SQL database, explore the data and ask some basic questions, draw some insightful conclusions and then communicate these to a broader audience.  
The purpose of this session is to show R strengths and weaknesses to help you decide if R is a useful language that is worth investing time and effort to learn and master.

## Title: PowerShell - Jump from simple scripts to advanced functions
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever thought to take your PowerShell scripts to the next level? And if by doing so they become more robust and reusable?
In this session we will convert a simple PowerShell script in an advanced function and we will explore what we gain with this transformation.

Among others we will see how: 
 - Create / import modules from functions; 
 - Take advantage of: 
    - Input by pipeline; 
    - Common parameters to cmdlets as "Verbose", "-ErrorAction" and "-WarningAction"; 
    - Risk mitigation parameters as "-WhatIf" and "-Confirm"; 
    - Help

We will also see in action a set of functions that are designed to automate and save time on real cases of everyday life of a DBA.

## Title: Approaches to database Unit Testing
 
**Abstract**:
Database testing can be challenging, for a number of reasons that will be touched on in this session. 

We will discuss the motivations for unit testing, as well as some of the particular challenges involved in testing database code and integrating this testing into the software development process.

Over the years, a number of tools and approaches have been developed to address these difficulties, and we will draw comparisons between some of these in order to highlight the questions you need to consider in choosing a testing approach for your own projects.

## Title: Storage For the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
One of the biggest issues in database performance centers around storage.  It’s also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language.  In this session, we’ll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives.   We’ll be digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, as well as RAID Groups.  In addition to theory, we’ll be looking at an actual EMC SAN so that we can translate what we see in the Storage Array with what we see on the actual server.
