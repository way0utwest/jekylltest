## Title: Analysis Services - Multidimensional vs. PowerPivot vs. Tabular/BISM
 
**Abstract**:
Remember the days when Analysis Services solely represented an OLAP engine?  Are you unclear about when to still build cubes vs. invoke the new Tabular engine in SSAS?  Do you feel confused about where the self-service capabilities of PowerPivot end and where enterprise BI begins?  If you answered YES to any of those questions, please join A.J. Mee (Principal BI Specialist at Microsoft) for some practical, real-world guidance around the three modes of SQL Server Analysis Services.  As with most of A.J.'s presentations, the vast majority of the time will be spent providing demonstrations of the technology.  Both traditional (i.e. relational) and non-traditional (i.e. unstructured/semi-structured) data sources may be incorporated into the demonstrations.

## Title: Do Some SOLR Searching with .NET
 
**Abstract**:
You've designed your application, built it up, and it's working great.  One of the last features to implement is searching and reporting.  You think you can get away with just implementing some SQL LIKE statements for an initial search, but you need to search across many fields or perform faceted searches.  You've put it off because you really don't want to deal with SQL Server Full-Text Indexing - maybe it's not your cup of tea or maybe it's just intimidating or maybe you're not using SQL Server.  But there are alternatives to Full-Text Indexing that can be just as powerful and fairly simple.  SOLR is one such open source tool to help you with your application's searching needs.  We'll take a look at the SOLR project, how you can get it up and running very easily, how you can install it as a Windows Service (as opposed to a command window), and how you can use SOLR.net to program against it.  We'll look at basic searches along with some cool features like faceting.

## Title: Building Your First AlwaysOn Failover Cluster Instance
 
**Abstract**:
Are you starting to plan for high availability and curious to see how clustering can keep your databases online and mitigate downtime during patching? Have you heard about clustering but have no idea what is required to build a successful cluster? If so, this session is for you.  During this session we will compare the pros and cons of Failover Cluster Instances to ensure you implement the best solution to handle you’re HA requirements. We will build a windows cluster from scratch and go over all the requirements including failover cluster manager, nodes, shared storage, active directory, client access points, quorums and installing a SQL Server clustered instance.  Finally, we will go over a basic framework to help you quickly perform a root cause analysis to determine why your SQL services went down.

## Title: Table Partitioning: the Secret Weapon for your Big Data Problems.
 
**Abstract**:
Is big data starting to slow you down? Is data growth putting your maintenance tasks in danger of not meeting your service level agreements? Do you wish you could archive old data with minimal impact to your tables during the archive process? Do you wish you could eliminate the majority of the data in your tables when you query them? If so, its time you consider implementing table partitioning to help with your general performance and to reduce your maintenance window for completing your maintenance tasks. In this session you will learn how table partitioning works and when it should be implemented. You will be able to understand how to initially configure partition functions and partition schemes to have a rock solid partitioned table. Finally, you will learn how to implement an automated sliding window to maintain your partitioned tables for ensuring optimal performance.

## Title: Handling catch all or sometimes queries
 
**Abstract**:
We have all had requirements for a procedure based upon many parameters that may or may not contain a value. These are typically seen as the code behind a search screen. The end users need to do this regularly, and they can be real performance killers.

This session will provide a number of different ways to handle "sometimes" queries, and provide techniques to make these perform faster.

Michael John is a Senior DBA with almost 20 years experience working and solving problems for both Fortune 100 companies and smaller firms. As a frequent contributor to many of the community newsgroups, and expert at answering the 2:00 AM problem phone calls, Michael has seen nearly every issue as a DBA in his career.

## Title: Monitoring and Baselines
 
**Abstract**:
During an incident you can look at every stat in SQL Server, but if you don’t know what normal is for that specific server then they won’t be very useful to you.  Also, outside of incidents, it’s very beneficial to know what your most expensive queries are for the month instead of since the last recompile, or seeing when your page life expectancy drops instead of just noticing it’s low.  Without proactively monitoring SQL Server you’re making your job more difficult and less productive at the same time.

This will cover OS Perf Counters, Wait Stats, Traces, Blocking, Query Stats, Index Stats, Database Sizes and Table Sizes, all presented in a format of what you should be watching and how it will help you.

**Abstract**:
How many times have you started a new SSIS project and added the same components that you’ve added to almost every other package you’ve created?  Components to handle logging and errors or even a standard workflow for loading data files.  In this session I’ll show you how you can create standard templates that already contain any and all of the common components you desire.  We’ll also look at how to implement and use these templates so that the next time you create a SSIS package you can spend your time on the work you actually need to do instead of implementing common components over and over again.

## Title: Mastering Date-Time Based Analysis in DAX
 
**Abstract**:
A large volume of analysis that a business typically performs on its data involves dates and/or times. For example, you may need to compare sales from one year to the next or aggregate transactions over time.  DAX incorporates many built in time intelligence functions to help make date-time based calculations easier. Although the time intelligence functions are very beneficial, they can be misused and give erroneous results.This session is guides you through the various time intelligence functions available in DAX and provide practical examples of how to use them.

I have been working with SQL Server since 2000, but never in an environment that threw me deep into the internals of SQL Server until 2010.  Now I'm starting to get obsessed with taking what I learned in the last couple of years and throwing that information out there.  It should be noted that I'm presenting to specific person in everything I do... the 2008 or earlier version of me.  If I knew what I know now 10 years ago, my career would have been very different.
