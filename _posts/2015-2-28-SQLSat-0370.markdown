## Title: The Leader in Server-Side Storage Intelligence 
 
**Abstract**:
Storage bottlenecks are consistently the root cause of application performance issues in virtualized data centers.  Solving this problem via traditional storage architectures can be costly, inefficient, and provide lackluster results.  PernixData software puts storage intelligence into high speed server media, enabling a decoupled storage architecture that optimizes VM performance while leveraging any shared storage for capacity.  Benefits of PernixData software include: •      Fast VM performance: Fault tolerant read and write acceleration using server flash and RAM.•      Flexible data center design: Decouple storage performance from capacity to minimize hardware costs.•      Seamless deployment and operations:  100% software – No changes to VMs, hosts, or storage; No rip and replace of existing hardware.

## Title: RC, SI, and RCSI, Oh My! –We're off to see the Wizard -to understand how it all works
 
**Abstract**:
I'm just going to say it straight out. I'm pessimistically optimistic that most really understand transaction concurrency in SQL Server. There is often significant confusion about transaction concurrency and contention options available to Developers -is it 'pessimistic', or 'optimistic', or in between? Everyone ‘sort of’ understands READ COMMITTED (RC). But do you sometimes feel 'dirty' as you attempt to 'repeatedly' read that phantasma? In order to reduce locking and blocking conflicts, some folks adopt SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (SI). And a few hardy stalwarts have ventured into the new world of READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (RCSI). In this session, we will explore the differences between the three, including a discussion about the positives and negatives of each option. We will discuss the effects of 'Dirty', 'Repeatable' and 'Phantom' reads, and why you may want to know which may be buried in your code. There will be code examples demonstrating the benefits and traps of each option.

## Title: Standalone to High-Availability Clusters over Lunch—with Time to Spare
 
**Abstract**:
Don't miss this demonstration of the hot new container technology that will change your assumptions about what it takes to implement high-availability clusters--on physical and/or virtual machines. Join DH2i’s Carl Berglund as he transforms standalone SQL Server instances of different versions and editions into an automated HA cluster failing over between systems—in just a few minutes. In fact, he'll have plenty of time left over to show you some other cool tricks with his new cluster, such as: QoS controls at the instance level, SQL and OS updates as fast as an application stop/start, and multi-subnet geo-clustering capabilities. And you’ll still have time to grab dessert.

## Title: Achieving Peak Performance from your Virtual SQL Servers
 
**Abstract**:
Your SQL Servers are probably virtualized by now, but are they running at their absolute peak performance? How can you tell? When properly configured and maintained, a virtualized SQL Server will be at least as fast as the system that it came from, if not better. If not properly configured, silent performance killers can wreck your virtualization experience. This session will give you tips and tricks to maximize performance while giving you talking points so you can convince your infrastructure engineers to design the virtualization stack your way. This session goes deep into the architecture and methodology for squeezing the best possible performance from your virtualized SQL Server, and includes valuable tips on topics such as host-level over-commitment, storage performance, In-memory OLTP, and more!

## Title: Extending Your Availability Group for Disaster Recovery
 
**Abstract**:
Did you know that SQL Server Availability Groups can be a great solution for disaster recovery?  Availability groups have become well known for their high availability capabilities, and for good reason: they work well, they remove some of clustering’s limitations, and they are fairly straightforward to setup.  Extending an availability group to multiple sites for disaster recovery becomes more complicated.  A lot of moving parts have to come together for it to work properly - SQL Server, Windows, Active Directory, and DNS all get involved in this advanced configuration.  In this session, we’ll discuss some of the factors that complicate a multi-site availability group deployment, and we’ll walk through a multi-site deployment so you can see how it’s done.

## Title: Guerilla MDM via MDS/SSIS Implementation
 
**Abstract**:
 I have implemented at several client. In implementing MDS   I have extensive experience in creating data quality, data governance and MDM/MDS accelerators I published many articles.

Accelerators can take many forms generally there either software products that accelerate development and/or techniques that embody data aware and code generation capabilities.

In developing the MDS application extracting data, applying data quality, loading MDS entities, and extracting data from MDS, we have applied these techniques, that I have published articles on.

Specifically we've created an
SSIS/MDS application architecture is highly reusable and can easily be used to Quickstart other MDS projects requiring minimal change and leaving the best practices for MDS architecture, as I understand them. The basic principle we applied this to be a data aware (data profiling)and create SSIS code that will self generate loan pr

## Title: SSAS Multidimensional vs. SSAS Tabular – Which one do I use?
 
**Abstract**:
With the release of SQL Server 2012, we were introduced to two possible options when it came to Analysis Services.  This ultimately presented a question…”Which one do I use SSAS multidimensional or SSAS tabular”?  

Determining whether multidimensional or tabular is the optimum solution for your organization is a key step when working with SQL Server Analysis Services 2012/2014. This session will introduce you to some of the common pitfalls with each solution and how you can avoid them. By the end of this session, you’ll have a clearer understanding of the strengths and weakness of each model and how your organization can optimally leverage the strengths of SSAS 2012/2014.

## Title: Enterprise-grade MDM On SQL Server - the Keys to Success 
 
**Abstract**:
This session discusses a proven organizational approach and important technical considerations that lead to the successful adoption of Master Data Management (MDM) on SQL Server. Organizational considerations include building buy-in, team capability  expertise, and selling MDM to the rest of the organization while building a subject-area center of excellence. We also discuss approaches to improved time-to-value and to ensure that the technology and staff investment is matched to the expected outcome. Great technology choices will help ensure that your best laid plans succeed and the second half of this session goes over some important technology considerations. In this part of the session we discuss User Experience, Integration Patterns, Matching, Programmability, and Data Quality

## Title: SQL Server Backups and Restores A to Z
 
**Abstract**:
Have you become the de facto DBA? Have you been tasked with the responsibility of backing up your databases? Do you feel that your database maintenance plan is adequate, but may be lacking in what it can do?  If these scenarios sound familiar, you’ll want to join this session, where Microsoft Certified Master (MCM) Keith Tate will walk you through the basics of backup and restore options. 
The session will begin with the reasons why databases must be backed up (hint: to restore them). Then, discuss the different recovery models and how they affect your backup strategy. Next, explore ways to automate backup and restore strategies, and review ways to improve the speed of your backups and restores. Finally, put it all together and you’ll be on your way to a disaster proof backup and restore strategy.

## Title: Dynamically Increase your Data Awareness
 
**Abstract**:
Data Profiling is a vital step that is often overlooked in the development process. Integration Services (SSIS) built-in support for data profiling is limited and takes manual user intervention. Learn a new approach to automate data profiling and increase your data awareness. 
In this session we will walk through a framework that dynamically develops a group of packages that can profile data based on the existing metadata within your current environment. By dynamically tracking the metadata within your environment, you can easily maintain your data monitoring solution. This will enable a more thorough view of your ETL environment that will allow you to spot issues faster and create a more scaled infrastructure based on your current performance needs.

## Title: SQL Server Statistics – What Are The Chances?
 
**Abstract**:
For far too long, I thought that statistics only contained information on table row counts.  While they do contain that information, there is more to it than that.  In this beginner session, we’ll go over statistics – how they are created, the different types of statistics that exist, how they’re maintained and how the Query Optimizer uses them.  We will also touch on system tables and DMVs that will provide additional information on your statistics.  We'll also go over the cardinality estimator changes in 2014.  At the end of this session, you should have a better idea of how the query optimizer within SQL Server makes decisions on how to gather data.

## Title: Introduction to Microsoft Azure DocumentDB
 
**Abstract**:
Developers are interested in consuming and processing very large amounts of data as quickly as possible.  Microsoft Azure DocumentDB is a NoSQL document database service designed for modern mobile and web applications which require fast reads and writes of unstructured data feeds. Azure DocumentDB natively supports JSON documents which is a key performance feature.
In this session I will demonstrate how to create a DocumentDB instance in Azure, how to work with JSON documents, create Ad hoc queries with familiar SQL syntax, create application logic as stored procedures, triggers and user defined functions (UDFs) using standard JavaScript.

## Title: SQL Server Filesystem
 
**Abstract**:
As part of the SQL Server OS, SQL Server has its own file system built on top of the Windows NTFS.  Understanding how the SQL Server filesystem works and how it interacts with NTFS and storage is critical to SQL Server performance.  This presentation will start with a  brief review of NTFS and then go into depth on the SQL Server filesystem.  It should help you understand:
•         Why is fragmentation bad for performance?
•         Why should I allocate more than one file in a filegroup?
•         Why should I not rely on autogrow to size my SQL files?
•         Why is autoshrink a very bad thing?
•         What should my NTFS allocation unit size be set to?
•         How many files should tempdb have?

All this and more!

## Title: WIT Panel
 
**Abstract**:
The definition of confidence is “belief in oneself and one’s powers or abilities” but the authors of the new book “The Confidence Code” define confidence as “the quality that turns thoughts into actions.” Traditionally men have been found to have much more confidence in themselves than do women. For example, in a study at Hewlett-Packard, men applied for a promotion when they thought they could meet 60% of the qualifications while women applied only when they thought they could meet 100%.   Attend this WIT session to learn more about confidence and how it impacts your career and life. To prepare for the session, it is recommended that you complete The Confidence Quiz (http://theconfidencecode.com/confidence-quiz/)

## Title: Setting the stage...
 
**Abstract**:
Making successful deployments consistently is something your executive team wishes could happen.  Sometimes they wish it so hard, that you end up becoming that cowboy that tests everything in production (you know who you are).  Procuring equipment and configuring an environment so that you can have some confidence in your solutions, while not destroying customer data, can be a challenge...especially if you have no plan of attack to hand the people that sign the checks.

In this session we will discuss the need for, the design of, and the way to get a staging environment that can boost your deployment success rate, allow developers to fearlessly code creative solutions, and allow you the DBA to get some sleep knowing they aren't testing in production.

## Title: Change Data Capture (CDC) with SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
Whether you are trying to setup a new data warehouse, keep it updated, audit changes to your databases or quickly load changes to another database Change Data Capture (CDC) is a solution for all of these and can now be setup and supported easily with SQL Server  SSIS 2012! Change Data Capture (CDC) has been around since SQL Server 2008, but has been underused because it was difficult to fully implement. SSIS 2012 now provides support for CDC with new components that make consuming the captured data very easy to apply. This session will define what CDC is and with live demos show how it is setup on your databases. Once it has been setup then you need to consume and apply those changes, this will be demonstrated with live demos using SSIS 2012 to create packages that apply the changes.

## Title: The Significance of Choosing the Right Data Types
 
**Abstract**:
It’s an all too common occurrence to have table columns or variables that have been assigned less than ideal data types. Join this session and learn the importance of choosing the proper data type, the guidelines in determining what an appropriate data type would be, and, once chosen, some tools for its usage and management. There will be several demonstrations on performance and accuracy issues, along with their possible solutions, caused by either the assignment of inappropriate data types or improper usage of them. 
In addition, we will cover several data type related functions, and the caveats in their usage. Even advanced T-SQL developers and DBAs will walk away with a useful nugget or two.

## Title: The Life Cycle of a Query in 3D
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever wondered what really happens behind the scenes when you execute a query? In this unique demonstration, Todd will use a video game engine (Unreal Engine 4) and will dramatically show The Life Cycle of a Query in 3D. We will follow a query from beginning to end and "runthrough" the various SQL Server components all queries must use including the Protocol Layer, Relational Engine, Storage Engine, Buffer Pool and then back out to the client. A volunteer at the end will then don an Oculus Rift DK2 Virtual Reality headset and then race through the sections in under a minute to win a prize. Participants will leave with a better understanding of the major components and with a conceptual framework to explore the components more in-depth.

## Title: Powershell - Automating build and deployment in a datawarehouse environment   
 
**Abstract**:
There are many components which are developed and integrated as part of the large database solution – databases, ETL packages, reports, roles/security, SharePoint presentment, dashboards, etc.  But the solution also needs to be managed in the context of a robust ALM, many physical environments with varying configurations, and many developers contending for resources.  Automated builds are critical to such a solution.  In this session we will examine the techniques used at one company to leverage PowerShell to drive automated processes to build, deploy, and test a solution in their development, testing, and QA environments.  We will see live demos of the tools involved.

## Title: Understanding Parameter Sniffing
 
**Abstract**:
Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.

## Title: Introduction to Excel pivot tables
 
**Abstract**:
When people have a pile of data on which they need to do some basic analysis, most still turn to Excel as an easy-to-use data analysis tool. While there are many advanced BI tools you can use to help data tell the story, one of the easiest to use is built-in functionality, the Excel pivot table. In this session, we’ll review what a pivot table is, how to put your data together to leverage the power behind it, and do some demonstrations. We’ll also, time permitting, get into some of the more advanced features of pivot tables and show how they can be used to do some pretty advanced data analysis and aggregation.

## Title: Introduction to Wait Types and Response Time Analysis
 
**Abstract**:
Using Response Time Analysis and Wait Types is a newer method for tuning SQL Server instances. As a result, there is often confusion on exactly what the data means. The issue typically centers around the fact the wait time data is analyzed at the wrong level or the collected wait time data is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using SQL Server Wait Type data coupled with Response time performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues.

## Title: How "quirky" is your update?
 
**Abstract**:
Running totals are a lot easier with the SQL Server 2012 T-SQL syntax, but making it perform over large data sets still remain a challenge. This demo-heavy session will explore the good, the bad and the ugly when it comes to calculating running totals. 

Our main focus however, will be a method coined by Jeff Moden as the "quirky update". This method produces lightning-fast results when calculating running totals, and sometimes the only option if you're dealing with large volumes and high performance requirements.

## Title: Writing Better T-SQL Queries with Window Functions
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2005 and later versions introduced several T-SQL features that are like power tools in the hands of T-SQL developers. If you aren’t using these features, you’re probably writing code that doesn’t perform as well as it could. 

This session will teach you how to get great performance, avoid cursor solutions, and create simpler code by using the window functions that have been introduced between 2005 and 2012. You'll learn how to use the new functions and how to apply them to several design patterns that are commonly found in the real world.

## Title: Geospatial Data Types in SQL Server 2012
 
**Abstract**:
The geospatial capabilities in SQL Server are not only powerful, but easy and fun to use! In this session, Lenni shows you how to integrate location-awareness into your own applications with the geometry and geography data types. We’ll explore the planar and geodetic spatial models, spatial markup languages such as WKT and GML, and then put these concepts to use as we build several useful demos, (e.g., Bing Maps integration). Demos show how to use the geospatial methods to easily calculate area, length, and distance, and project new shapes based on intersection and overlap. Attend this session and embrace spatial programming today!

## Title: Protecting Your Data with Encryption
 
**Abstract**:
We’ve all seen the recent news stories about companies whose data has been stolen by hackers.  What was once a rare event has become all too common, and companies large and small are at risk.  While it isn’t always possible to prevent intrusions, you can reduce the risk by encrypting your data.  In this presentation, I’ll show you the four ways that SQL Server provides to encrypt data: hashes, cell-level encryption, database-level encryption (also known as transparent data encryption), and backup encryption.  We’ll also discuss the keys required for each type of encryption and discuss how to protect the keys themselves.

## Title: SQL Server 2014 Column Store Index vNEXT
 
**Abstract**:
The Column Store Index functionality released in SQL 2012 did allow for stunning performance gains for OLAP-style queries, but as a v1.0 release it suffered from a number of caveats, limitations, provisos, etc.  The one BIGGIE was that it made it's underlying table NON-UPDATABLE.  Well, that often implementation-killing restriction has been addressed, along with a huge number of other fixes and enhancements.  We will cover what those are and also see actual usage with some nice demos.
