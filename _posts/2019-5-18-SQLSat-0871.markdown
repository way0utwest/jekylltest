##Title: Il mio grosso grasso modello di Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
Le ottime prestazioni del motore di Power BI (VertiPaq), unite al suo elevato fattore di compressione dei dati, spesso rendono superflua l’attività di ottimizzazione dei modelli dati realizzati con Power BI desktop.
In realtà questa è una buona prassi che dovrebbe sempre essere prevista nel ciclo di sviluppo dei nostri modelli indipendentemente dalla loro dimensione e complessità.
In questa sessione, dopo una breve introduzione teorica sul funzionamento di VertiPaq e dei suoi algoritmi di compressione, ci concentreremo su alcune best practices da seguire per ottimizzare i nostri modelli e sugli strumenti a nostra disposizione per verificare l’effettivo livello di ottimizzazione degli stessi. Inoltre, vedremo come sia possibile raccogliere, tramite DMV, tutte le informazioni utili delle strutture dati dei nostri modelli utilizzando Power BI desktop, fino a realizzare una versione “Power BI” del famoso tool Vertipaq Analizer.

##Title: Set-based vs Iterative programming (IT)##
 
**Abstract**:
Confrontato con gli altri linguaggi di programmazione, T-SQL non è difficile da imparare e al netto di eventuali errori sintattici può essere molto tollerante. Tuttavia, per ottenere il massimo delle prestazioni dobbiamo sfruttare una delle sue caratteristiche più importanti, la sua natura dichiarativa! In questa sessione confronteremo due approcci per sviluppare codice T-SQL, l'approccio Set-based e l'approccio Procedurale. Vedremo perché l'approccio Set-Based è raccomandato e da dove derivano le difficoltà che si incontrano nel pensare una soluzione Set-based fin dall'inizio. Solo attraverso un'attenta valutazione della struttura e della logica delle query, unita alla consapevolezza di avere a disposizione un linguaggio dichiarativo, gli sviluppatori potranno ottenere, dal proprio codice T-SQL, il massimo delle performance e della scalabilità.

##Title: Stranger IoThing: behind remote monitoring##
 
**Abstract**:
Una soluzione di remote monitoring consta di vari elementi dall'invio delle telemetrie dai dispositivi fino allo store dei dati.
Vediamo dunque la soluzione usando IoT hub per gestire i dati in ingresso, la manipolazione di questi dati attraverso uno Stream Analytics e il suo immagazzinamento mostrandoli infine in una web app in near real time.
Vedremo il tutto attraverso una demo reale con un dispositivo compatibile arduino (azure iot development kit) e i dati dei suoi sensori.

##Title: Machine Learning - Best Practices##
 
**Abstract**:
Sempre più progetti oggi necessitano della potenza dell'intelligenza Artificiale ed del Machine Learning.
Per progetti la cui problematica è standard si possono trovare soluzione pronte all'uso, tuttavia questa estrema facilità spesso è il più grande nemico quando dobbiamo risolvere problematiche specifiche o custom.
In questa sessione scopriremo come applicare alcune best practices nell'uso e configurazione del ML, ma soprattutto, ne abbiamo sempre realmente bisogno?
Analizzeremoi alcuni falsi miti nell'impiego del ML e quando non è necessario usarlo.

##Title: Self-Service ETL: The PowerBI Data Flows##
 
**Abstract**:
What was already good has became even better. We were already able to make ETL in PowerBI using M, now, using the PoweBI Data Flows we are able to store the ETL on the PowerBI Portal, control the ETL execution, the data among many ETL steps and share the result with many Power BI files, instead of having to duplicate M scripts accross different .PBIX files

In this session you will understand better what Data Flows can bring to our already powerful self-service BI tools

##Title: SQL Server Execution Plans: From Zero to Hero (IT)##
 
**Abstract**:
Ogni query, prima di essere eseguita, viene trasformata dal Query Optimizer in un piano di esecuzione. Il piano di esecuzione descrive in quale ordine verranno accedute le tabelle, quali saranno gli indici utilizzati, quali gli operatori di JOIN e molto altro. In questa sessione impareremo a leggere i piani di esecuzione per trarre informazioni che ci permettano di scrivere query più efficienti; vedremo infine anche le caratteristiche del piano di esecuzione per i comandi INSERT/UPDATE e DELETE.

Curious, creative and determined, I've been playing with technology since I have memory, and my aproach to problems concerning technologies is methodic, logic and still genuine. 
When it comes to business I believe that only three things matter most: ask, listen, do. Ask for resources to meet customer expectations, listen what is the customer value, do and keep doing until is done.
