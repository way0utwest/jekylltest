##Title: From Minutes to Milliseconds: High-Performance SSRS Tuning##
 
**Abstract**:
Even though you're an experienced report developer or administrator, performance tuning for SQL Server Reporting Services still feels as bewildering and hopeless as folding a fitted bed sheet. You've made your data sets smaller and timeouts longer, but it's not enough to remove the slowness dragging down your reporting environment.

In this session, you'll learn how design and configuration choices put pressure on your report server and techniques to relieve that pressure. You’ll see how to configure your Reporting Services databases for speed, houseclean your subscription schedules, and use caching for high-demand reports. You'll also learn some design strategies to lighten your report processing load. If you want to maximize the speed of your Reporting Services environment and minimize the pain of performance tuning, this session is for you.

##Title: SSIS Incremental Load Design Patterns##
 
**Abstract**:
The volume of data addressed by the typical ETL operation is constantly on the rise.  Not so many years ago, a table with a few million records was considered to be huge.  These days, it's not uncommon to deal with multibillion row tables.  As a result, ETL professionals are frequently tasked with finding efficient ways to incrementally process these large sets of data without resorting to expensive and time-consuming destructive reloads. In this session, we will review the common decision points surrounding incrementally loading data, and will illustrate some of the design patterns for incremental processing.  Among the topics of discussion:-- Deciding whether an incremental load is appropriate-- Pick your tool: T-SQL or SSIS?-- Methods for detecting new and changed records-- Common incremental load design patterns

##Title: XQuery Basics for the DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
For the past few years, XML has been making its way more and more into our SQL Server instances. For a moment let’s forget that developers often find the need to store XML data in their databases. Outside of those databases, XML has already invaded our SQL Servers. It’s made its way into execution plans with the SHOWPLAN XML. It’s telling us about deadlock through deadlock graphs. It’s also presented to us through service broke, event notifications, and extended events. XML is there and we need to learn how to query it. In this session, we’ll explore some of the basic methods for querying XML through XQuery. By the end of the session you’ll be equipped with the tools and understanding needed to ease yourself into XQuery.

##Title: Prototyping with PowerPivot: Handling External Analysis Services 2012 Grouping##
 
**Abstract**:
Once the enterprise implements SSAS, immediate reporting benefits appear as the power of OLAP is unleashed in the speed of aggregations, the support of organization-wide ad hoc analysis and reporting, and myriad other advantages. A common need that then often arises is the capability to perform extra-hierarchy groupings. In this session, BI Architect and MVP Bill Pearson presents an approach to accomplishing external grouping with PowerPivot. We examine ways to accomplish a stated, example business need for such grouping via the addition of PowerPivot to an integrated Microsoft BI solution. Moreover, we discuss ways to design a scalable solution with PowerPivot that we can then entrain into the base warehouse / mart / cube structure.

##Title: Hailing Frequencies: SSAS Terms and Concepts##
 
**Abstract**:
In this Star Trek-themed presentation, we will explain the terms and concepts important to understand when participating in projects involving SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS).

You’ll learn the key differences between SSAS Multidimensional Model (Cubes) and SSAS Tabular Model. You’ll also learn the definitions and examples of key terms for each model, including but not limited to: measure groups, measures, dimensions, attributes, and hierarchies in the SSAS Multidimensional Model and tables, columns, and calculated measures in the SSAS Tabular Model. We will also demonstrate the basics of browsing of both Multidimensional and Tabular models using Excel 2013.

##Title: Getting Started with Analysis Services 2012 Tabular##
 
**Abstract**:
The Analysis Services 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI.  In this session, BI Architect, SQL Server MVP and Analysis Services Maestro Bill Pearson introduces Microsoft Business Intelligence 2012 and the Business Intelligence Semantic Model ("BISM").  He then overviews the Tabular model, beginning with the creation of a project with SQL Server Data Tools (“SSDT”), and continuing from the data import steps to the creation and management of calculations, measures and Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”).  Finally, he provides insight to the creation and maintenance of perspectives and hierarchies, as well as other considerations involved in working with Tabular.

##Title: Database Design Fundamentals##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).

##Title: Unit Testing Fundamentals ##
 
**Abstract**:
How can you be certain the "little change" you're about to make to that stored procedure isn't going to take down your whole company? Real developers use a technique called "Unit Testing" to minimize that risk, a concept that's also available to you. With unit testing you can quick ascertain whether the the changes to functions, stored procedures, and even other objects in your database had a negative unforeseen impact.

In this session we'll walk through the basics of what unit testing is, how to set up a simple Unit Testing project in SSMS, how we can tell whether something has negatively changed in our functions or procedures.  We'll also enumerate any 3rd party tools available to help us with Unit Testing our databases.

##Title: How to Write a DML Trigger##
 
**Abstract**:
Triggers are extremely powerful and useful (if somewhat rarely needed) objects that are coded very similar to a common stored procedure. Yet for their similarity, there are some very important differences that need to be understood. In this session, I will walk through what goes into writing a robust DML trigger, starting with a simple version of a trigger, and working through some very useful applications of DML Triggers..

##Title: Mission Critical Confidence – (SQL 2012 AlwaysOn) and Availability Groups##
 
**Abstract**:
AlwaysOn is SQL Server 2012’s High Availability solution.  It provides a new standard for mission critical databases and end-to-end business intelligence at a lower total cost of ownership.  It provides the required 9S of availability without the total cost and complexity.
In this session, we’ll specifically explore high availability databases – Availability Groups.  AG is a new feature that enhances and combines database mirroring and log shipping.  We’ll demonstrate the setup and failover of multiple databases simultaneously.

##Title: An Optimistic Approach: Snapshot Isolation in SQL ##
 
**Abstract**:
Until 2005, SQL Server was a very pessimistic RDBMS.  However with the introduction of the Read Committed Snapshot database option and the new Snapshot Isolation level, that is no longer the case.

After a high level look at all SQL Server isolation levels, we’ll spend the majority of this session discussing the implementation of optimistic concurrency control in SQL Server.  We’ll look at the benefits and drawbacks of using an optimistic isolation level and discuss use cases where it may or may not be appropriate.

Come learn how to put one of the more powerful, but least understood, aspects of SQL Server to work for you!

##Title: Interrogating the Transaction Log ##
 
**Abstract**:
Without the transaction log, SQL Server would have no way of maintaining a consistent and durable view of its data.  It would be pandaemonium!!!  Think of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  

Thankfully the transaction log is there and we can all breathe easier.
In this session, you will learn how SQL Server uses the transaction log to maintain the durability and consistency of its data, along with methods for reading the transaction log and identifying active transactions.
