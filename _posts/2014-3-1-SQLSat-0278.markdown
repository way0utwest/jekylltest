## Title: Let's PowerBI Hungary with Big Data!
 
**Abstract**:
In this fun session, we will use Microsoft's Big Data and PowerBI tools to learn about Hungary! We will mix and mashup data from a variety of sources such as 'The Spirit Level' by Prof Richard Wilkinson, UNICEF, the World Bank and even the CIA to learn more about Hungary. Business Intelligence professionals need to tackle ever-increasing sources of data that are increasing in volume, velocity and variety. Let's look at fun example of global data about Hungary to look at common data storytelling by BI and BA professionals: analysing open data with varying degrees of data quality, business puzzles versus business mysteries, and deciding on which chart or graph to use when presenting data. If the 'too much data, too little information' scenario is familiar, then come to this session, which isn't just for the international visitors visiting SQLSaturday Budapest like myself! Uncover surprising facts as we mashup, slice and dice the data, and look at Big Data and Data Visualisation along the

## Title: Azure SQL Database Tips and Tricks for Beginners
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft released SQL Azure more than two years ago - that's enough time for testing (I hope!). So, are you ready to move your data to the Cloud? If you’re considering a business (i.e. a production environment) in the Cloud, you need to think about methods for backing up your data, a backup plan for your data and, eventually, restoring with Red Gate Cloud Services (and not only). In this session, you’ll see the differences, functionality, restrictions, and opportunities in SQL Azure and On-Premise SQL Server 2008/2008 R2/2012. We’ll consider topics such as how to be prepared for backup and restore, and which parts of a cloud environment are most important: keys, triggers, indexes, prices, security, service level agreements, etc.

## Title: Optimizing Temporal Queries
 
**Abstract**:
Having a SQL Server solution for a problem does not mean the job is done. Of course, the next immediate issue is the performance. Temporal queries that involve intervals are typically very IO and CPU intensive. For example, a test for overlapping intervals was solved with inefficient queries for years. However, a handful of solutions with fast queries was developed lately. This high-level technical session introduces five different methods to get efficient queries that search for overlapping intervals. Of course, these solutions can be implemented on other temporal problems as well. Actually, the test for overlapping intervals is one of the most complex temporal problems.

## Title: Mastering the Excel CUBE Functions
 
**Abstract**:
This session explores the seven CUBE functions that are natively available in Excel. Unknown to many business analysts, these useful functions can be used to retrieve data model members and values to create parameter-driven report designs.The session topics will introduce each of the seven functions. Demonstrations will range from the simple, to the more sophisticated involving dynamic expressions, MDX expressions, integration of data from multiple data models, and macro-driven layouts.This session is a must for those looking to drive more from Excel when reporting from the BI Semantic Model. Much of the content presented in this session is applicable to Excel 2007, 2010 and 2013.

## Title: The nightmare of locking, blocking and isolation levels!
 
**Abstract**:
I am sure you all know that troubleshooting problems related to locking and blocking (hey, sometimes there are deadlocks too) can be a real nightmare! In this session, you will be able to see and understand why and how locking actually works, what problems it causes and how can we use isolation levels and various other techniques to resolve them!

## Title: Dynamic code for efficient searching 
 
**Abstract**:
Illustrate how multipurpose queries can lead to issues with scalability and performance. Show a few alternatives that will work for smaller and simpler queries while highlighting their limitations for more complex queries. Then work through building a dynamic search query to resolve the identified performance issues. Touching on: • Testing. • Tuning each part of the query in isolation. • Plan cache re-use • Security – SQL injection attacks and authorisation / code signing. • Possibly, mentioning greater re-use and extendibility.

## Title: Remodel your old EAV design
 
**Abstract**:
Sometimes you really need an EAV model. In most cases they are ugly and slow.
After this session you will have gained new insights how to turn your old, slow, EAV model into a slim superfast model.

There will be real life examples from a recent project. With the techniques displayed in the presentation, I cut the execution time down from 134 days down to 0.5 seconds and cut the storage need from 550GB to 45GB.

## Title: SSISDB Catalog Deep Dive
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2012 Integration Services introduces a new SSIS project deployment model. With the new model comes a completely new SSIS project management solution, named SSIS Server. In this session you will learn about the SSISDB Catalog, the new SSIS data store, and how to deploy, maintain and monitor SSIS project and package executions on SQL Server 2012. There are several significant changes in the way SSIS solutions are administered in SQL Server 2012 compared to previous versions, and you should be familiar with them before using them in production.

## Title: A jó index scan, a rossz index seek avagy hogyan olvassunk végrehajtási tervet
 
**Abstract**:
Mi az a végrehajtási terv? Miért hozza létre és mire használja az SQL Server? Mik azok az operátorok? Mi a különbség a logikai és fizikai operátorok között? Mit jelent az index seek és az index scan, melyik a jobb? Van-e tábla seek? Hogyan kell jól olvasni a végrehajtási terveket? Az előadás ezekre a kérdésekre ad választ.

## Title: T-SQL hibakezelés a gyakorlatban 
 
**Abstract**:
Szeretném bemutatni a T-SQL nyelv által biztosított hibakezelési eljárásokat, parancsokat és az elmúlt években szerzett tapasztalatokat. Itt nem csak a trry/catch és a throw használata, hanem az alábbi témakörök kerülnének lefedésre:
- alapvető hibakezelések: kell, nem kell?
- tranzakciók és a hibák
- XACT_ABORT hatása a hibákra és a tranzakciókra
- deadlock hibák kezelése
- hibák logolása

A prezentáció nagy hangsúlyt feketet a demókra, inkább gyakorlati, mint sem ppt alapú.

## Title: Adatbányászat SQL Server Analysis Services-el
 
**Abstract**:
Egy általános adatbányászatba történő bevezetést követően áttekintjük az SQL Server Analysis Services nyújtotta adatbányászati lehetőségeket. Végignézzük a rendelkezésünkre álló algoritmusokat, valamint azt, hogy melyiket mire lehet használni. Egy konkrét példán kereszül végigmegyünk az adatbányászati struktúra és modell létrehozásának folyamatán, modellt processzálunk és értelmezzük az elért eredményeket. Kicsit elmélyülünk a klaszterezésben, és megmutatjuk azt is, hogyan lehet lekérdezni és integrálni egy adatbányászati modellt.

## Title: SQL Server 2014 - New Cardinality Estimator
 
**Abstract**:
In SQL Server 2014 query processing has been improved. What we can expect from new cardinality estimator? Does it really estimate better? Will our execution plans be better after migration to 2014? All of them? Is the key ascending column statistics problem solved in new version? Do we finally can have more than 200 steps in the statistics histogram per table? What about column correlation and cardinality estimates - are the predicates still completely independent?

This session will answers all these questions and will demonstrate new query processing capabilities and compare them with those from SQL Server2012.

## Title: Windowing Functions: THE Reason to Upgrade to 2012
 
**Abstract**:
For the first time since SQL 7 there is a compelling reason for EVERY SQL Server user to upgrade to the next version and this time around the reason is Windowing Functions.   And these are NOT limited to Enterprise Edition, like so many other really useful and important features!  The range of data processing needs that can be very efficiently and cleanly solved with these tools is stunning. In this demo-packed session we will cover as many features as we can pack into an hour's time, and you can take the demo code back home with you to review at your leisure!

## Title: SQL Server and Transactional Replication - senkit sem hagy hidegen
 
**Abstract**:
Vajon miért beszélnek az emberek viszonylag keveset a tranzakcionális replikációról? Miért találunk nagyobb eséllyel nyitott kérdéseket ebben a témában egy fórumon, mint például mirroringban vagy mentésben? 

És mire jó a tranzakcionális replikáció egyáltalán, és mire nem? És hogyan lehet svájcibicskát csinálni belőle? Ezt próbálom meg körüljárni az összejövetel során.

## Title: Stored procedures — facts and myths
 
**Abstract**:
Everybody knows that use of stored procedures offers a number of benefits over issuing T-SQL code directly from an application. In this demo heavy session I am going to explain to you:
1. Why plan caching and reuse is a good thing.
2. How to avoid unnecessary recompilations for plan stability-related reasons.
3. How to avoid unnecessary recompilations for plan optimality-related reasons.
4. When plan reusing is not a good thing and how you can deal with this “Parameter Sniffing” problem.
5. Why you should evade conditional logic inside stored procedures that do data access.

## Title: Load Testing Analysis Services
 
**Abstract**:
Ever deployed an Analysis Services cube that worked perfectly well with one user on the development server, only to find that it doesn't meet the required volumes of user concurrency?
 
This session focuses on tools and methodology to load test Analysis Services in highly concurrent environments. Including how to locate resource bottlenecks and the appropriate configuration settings that can help improve performance.
 
Sample source code will be supplied to help you load test analysis services. We will be focused on the MOLAP engine, but techniques are equally applicable to the  tabular model.

## Title: SQL Server in motion - Page Splits
 
**Abstract**:
This session is based on participation of the audience for a great movie about SQL Server internals. This session will demonstrate complicated inernal db engine operatoins by using the audience as "objects" replaying each simple task.

So FUN should be the primaray target but step by step the audience will get familiar with the tremendous work SQL Server has to to when "simple" operations may occur
