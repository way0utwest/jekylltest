## Title: Consolidated Essential Performance Health Check using PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
Standardizing essential performance health check is the key in responding quickly to production issues and can cut down initial evaluation phase to 1/3rd of the time, whether you have been requested to do health check or you may want to run these due to an alert. These sets of essential checks can be the first major checkpoint for a DBA, they can look quickly on consolidated email stats first to decide if any further action is required to fix an issue or is it feasible to jump into in-depth troubleshooting. This will cut down on time and effort while responding to Production issues.

First part of the email shares some key observations about SQL Server performance which can be the key to quick resolution of the issue. Rest of the email shows different set of stats regarding CPU/Disk IO/Disk Space/Memory/Network/Blocking and database performance which could lead to the slowness observed in the application. This consolidated email can be shared with technical stakeholders to give a snaps

## Title: APPLY Yourself
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.

## Title: SQL Injections and How to Stop Them
 
**Abstract**:
Right now, there are hackers all around the world trying to get into your web applications. How safe are you? By using a technique called SQL injections, hackers can wreak havoc on web applications by compromising security, manipulating data, choking system resources, retrieving sensitive information, and modifying database objects. Without proper precautions, attackers can even drop databases! 

During the demo, we will take on a couple of different roles. As a hacker, we will walk through steps a hacker might take to compromise a web application in order to retrieve sensitive data such as credit card information, usernames, passwords, and social security numbers. Assuming the role of a developer, we will then show various prevention techniques and their effectiveness in preventing SQL injections.

Attend this session to learn how SQL injections work, identify if you are being attacked, and how to stop them!

## Title: Mastering Master Data Services
 
**Abstract**:
As your organization grows, one challenge will be the management of data between systems and organizational units. With MDS, Microsoft provides the ability to have one accurate source of non-transactional data. This data can then be used within applications, other databases, and ETL processes. By leveraging data stewards to help manage the data repository, you can ensure that your MDS data is always up-to-date and accurate.

In this presentation we will cover MDS from start to finish including installation, creating models/entities, working with data, using the Excel add-in, security, hierarchies, views, versions, and business rules. After this presentation, you will have a good understanding of what master data management is, what MDS does, how to use it, and how to get started with your own MDS project.

## Title: Changing Your Habits to Improve the Performance of Your T-SQL
 
**Abstract**:
Do you dread handing your T-SQL over for code review? Do your queries run slower than you expect? Does the DBA always want to tweak your T-SQL? In this demo-heavy session, we’ll take a look at various ways to improve your T-SQL. You’ll learn why top down design is not always the best pattern as well as why implicit conversions can slow down your queries. You’ll learn how to rewrite most cursors as well as finding out how user defined functions affect performance. You’ll learn some simple ways to troubleshoot these types of issues using execution plans and extended events. Finally, we’ll take a look at how standards can help quicken turnaround time when refactoring T-SQL. By changing some of your T-SQL writing habits you can improve performance of queries from the very beginning.

## Title: Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.

## Title: SQL Server Statistics – What Are The Chances?
 
**Abstract**:
For far too long, I thought that statistics only contained information on table row counts.  While they do contain that information, there is more to it than that.  In this beginner session, we’ll go over statistics – how they are created, the different types of statistics that exist, how they’re maintained and how the Query Optimizer uses them.  We will also touch on system tables and DMVs that will provide additional information on your statistics.  We'll also go over the cardinality estimator changes in 2014  2016.  At the end of this session, you should have a better idea of how the query optimizer within SQL Server makes decisions on how to gather data.

## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere
 
**Abstract**:
Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. "Virtualize First"; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too "critical" to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments. Got an SQL virtualization or performance question?  Bring it!

## Title: Redgate Source Control
 
**Abstract**:
It has been a long established practice to keep maintain application code in version control. Versioning your application code allows you to view changes made by several developers working on the same project. It allows the team to get the latest changes in a consistent and reliable manner. It allows you to return your code to a prior state. It even acts as a safety net for when that day comes when your developer’s computer won’t turn on.

So, what about your SQL Objects? 

Join me in this demo heavy session where we will explore the benefits of versioning your SQL Objects and learn how it can enable streamlined database development without sacrificing control and visibility. We’ll be using Red Gate’s SQL Source Control tool for demos, and we’ll see how it integrates with your existing version control software to manage your SQL Objects just like application code.

## Title: Re-Indexing - The quest of ultimate automation
 
**Abstract**:
How many times you have been called on weekends to handle a nightmare caused by Re-Indexing job? One of the most common aspect of performance tuning is a well-design dynamic index optimization process. If you ever wonder what it takes to design an efficient re-indexing process, which do selective re-indexing, handles blocking efficiently, avoid system downtime due to log disk full, automatically stop itself beyond a threshold, can be implemented across all sql servers regardless of application type or data size, in other words, fewer headaches. This session is for you!!

In this session, Prakash will walk you through design considerations, accompanied with a script demo using PowerShell to generate a dynamic re-indexing script , created based on his real-life experience from managing high performing database systems.

We've all been told at some point that heaps are usually bad for select, update, and delete performance. But how bad are they really? Can they also be problematic for inserts? Are they ever a good idea? For this installment of Rick's "Weird Stuff" series we will take a closer look at why heaps can cause issues and maybe see a deadlock or two.

## Title: Take a Dive into Azure Data Lake
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, we'll show the power of this Azure MPP solution.  T-SQL is a great data language that makes parallelism easy.  C# is a fantastic statically typed language that taps into the power of the .NET framework, but parallelism has a big barrier to entry.  Learn how U-SQL combines the best of both worlds to clean and analyze data at incredible levels.  Azure Data Lake Analytics makes Hadoop affordable and easy by leveraging your existing knowledge of T-SQL and C#.

## Title: Why are you still taking backups?
 
**Abstract**:
Keep doing things the same way because they have always worked in the past is a very comfortable mistake we all make in many areas. That includes backup strategies and service account administration. In this one hour presentation full of demos I will explore many options available in SQL Server 2016 and Azure that can potentially reduce the amount of data and time required for backups and even eliminate the need all together. It sounds scary but it will be really fun.

## Title: Row Based Security in SSRS and SSAS
 
**Abstract**:
It is relatively straight-forward to grant a user access to a particular SSRS report, multi-dimensional cube, or tabular model table, but what happens when the user needs access to the object but should be denied access to view certain rows of data? In this session we'll investigate a real-world solution to this common BI problem.

## Title: Backup and Recovery
 
**Abstract**:
"Backup and Recovery" is the most basic fundamental responsibility of any DBA, and your mastery (or lack thereof) of this topic can make you a hero or get you fired.  Beginner level folks will benefit from this talk because we'll cover the basics, but I think even more experienced DBA's might learn a few tricks.
Outline:
 * Review the fundamentals (recovery models, backup types, etc) with use cases
 * Give practical examples w/ syntax
 * Do performance tuning on backups
 * Recommend best practices and strategies
