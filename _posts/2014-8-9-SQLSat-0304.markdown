## Title: Better Decision Making with Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
For most organizations, business intelligence means requesting reports from IT. The IT people then go into the company’s databases to find the requested information and deliver it. If the decision-makers want the data displayed in a certain way, they have to specify it in their requests—or, as often as not, they have to return to the IT office to make another request when they realize they need the data presented differently. But Power BI is what’s called self-service business intelligence. That means for most purposes non-technical users will be able to crunch the numbers without any help from IT. And switching to different graphics and displays is so easy the main difficulty is deciding which one to use.

## Title: Building Perfect SQL Servers, Every Time
 
**Abstract**:
Some of the biggest challenges in any large SQL environment are maintaining consistent configurations and meeting the pressures from the business for rapid server deployments. Join us in this session to learn best practices for system settings, file system layout, and scheduling maintenance tasks. 

By default, SQL Server does not install with best practices for every environment. In this session, we will discuss the best practices for most SQL Server configurations, and how to automate your SQL Server builds in both physical and virtual worlds. As you may know, completely automating the build process has great benefits, but it also has great trade-offs. We will talk about lessons learned from building a private cloud at a Fortune 100 telecommunications company with thousands of servers. 

You will also learn how use these same methods to ensure your own server build consistency, whether your SQL Servers are in the cloud or on-premises.

## Title: Women in Tech Panel
 
**Abstract**:
The definition of confidence is “belief in oneself and one’s powers or abilities” but the authors of the new book “The Confidence Code” define confidence as “the quality that turns thoughts into actions.” Traditionally men have been found to have much more confidence in themselves than do women. For example, in a study at Hewlett-Packard, men applied for a promotion when they thought they could meet 60% of the qualifications while women applied only when they thought they could meet 100%.    Attend this WIT session with panelists Erin Stellato, Malathi Mahadevan, Ginger Grant, Tamera Clark, Meredith Ryan, and Kathi Kellenberger to learn more about confidence and how it impacts your career and life. To prepare for the session, it is recommended that you complete The Confidence Quiz (http://theconfidencecode.com/confidence-quiz/) before the event and print out the results and recommendation. NOTE: You will not be required to share your results with the other participants during the sessi

## Title: Making the Leap from Profiler to Extended Events
 
**Abstract**:
If you’re like me, you’ve been using SQL Trace and Profiler since you started using SQL Server.  They’re like old friends, tried and true.  You know how they work, you know what you can capture, you know how to find the data you need.  But now you’ve been told that your good friends have been deprecated in SQL Server 2012, and you need to become best friends with Extended Events.  What is THAT all about?  It’s ok.  Really.  In this session we’ll look at Profiler and Extended Events side by side to see how easy it is to transition to Extended Events.  We’ll step through real world examples using Extended Events to do what you’re used to doing with Trace, and even more.  You can find the time learn Extended Events…today.

## Title: Why Re-Invent the Wheel?  Build One Solution to Import/ Export Data
 
**Abstract**:
Most of the projects I work on or have worked on begin with importing some type of data or end with exporting some type of data or both.  Why do we continue to build solutions that include the importing or exporting of data?  Why have we not taken a practical look at how we solve problems in SQL Server and build our own tools to solve repetitive issues?  In this session you will learn some of the practical solutions I’ve implemented so that I never have to build a SSIS package that imports data to enable me to do the real work on the data; I get to do the fun stuff to the data right away because my import process has already been written, the data has been parsed and validated, and I have my data in a form that I can work with immediately.  I will demonstrate database design (tables, indexes, etc.), SSIS packages, stored procedures, views, and Columnstore Indexes to process data quickly.  Also, I will show a Visual Studio MVC Web application used to manage the solution.

## Title: Getting Started With Execution Plans
 
**Abstract**:
Are you just breaking into the query tuning side of managing your SQL Servers?  In this session, we will cover the basics you need to start leveraging execution plans as part of your tuning process.  We will discuss how SQL Server creates and uses plans, and how to collect them.  Once we have the plans, we will go step-by-step through how to read them, and what the most common operators mean.  We will look at the different types of operators not just from a standpoint of what they do, but how they can impact query performance.  We will also cover how good database design and maintenance allow you to get better execution plans through having the right indexes and up-to-date statistics.

## Title: Self Service Pitfalls 
 
**Abstract**:
Every Business Department, BI Developer,  BI Sales Consultant can put together a snazzy Power Pivot Demo and even prettier Power View Dashboard. They will wow you with capabilities and even convince you that Self Service BI can cure all that ails your organization. And while these tools are very powerful and provide huge benefit to organizations when used properly, in the wrong hands they can cause chaos and confusion. In this session we will discuss common pitfalls when implementing Self Service BI. We will discuss important issues such as Data Quality, Data Security,  Properly defining Roles and Responsibilities for end users. Yes, at the end of the day Self-Service BI is very powerful and a GREAT asset to organization, however implementing it properly is more important than the pretty Power View Visualization the sales person shows you!

## Title: 45 min to build your first SSRS report
 
**Abstract**:
Does this sound like you? You were just given access to SSRS and you want to make a report. Or, you're a DBA and could use a daily report. Either way, I've got your back!

## Title: Every Byte Counts: Why Your Data Type Choices Matter
 
**Abstract**:
Ever encounter a table consisting only of BIGINT, CHAR(255), and NVARCHAR(MAX) columns?  Did your gut tell you that this is bad, but you had difficulty explaining why?  Did you know that these Datatype Choices can be a real performance killer?  Attend this session, learn how database records are stored within SQL Server, and why all data types are not created equal.  Armed with that knowledge, we will then explore several performance scenarios that may be impacting your systems right now!  When you leave, you should be able to explain why datatype choices matter to your colleagues, assess your own systems, and implement some best practices to mitigate these performance killers.

## Title: The Lost Science of Set Theory
 
**Abstract**:
Many database developers today do not have a Computer Science degree and may also have begun their career developing software using procedural programming languages (Java, C#, etc.). As a result, they may not have the background needed to conceptualize solutions in terms of sets of data and therefore may not be able to develop efficient set-based queries. In this session, we will review the basics of set theory and how it applies to database development to enable you to turn cursors, loops, and other procedural programming practices into efficient set-based operations that make the most use of a relational database engine.

## Title: Writing Better T-SQL Queries with Window Functions
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2005 and later versions introduced several T-SQL features that are like power tools in the hands of T-SQL developers. If you aren’t using these features, you’re probably writing code that doesn’t perform as well as it could. 

This session will teach you how to get great performance, avoid cursor solutions, and create simpler code by using the window functions that have been introduced between 2005 and 2012.
