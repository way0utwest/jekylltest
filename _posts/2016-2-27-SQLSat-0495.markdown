## Title: Enterprise Information Management with SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
Companies want to gather information from the data; therefore, they start BI projects. They design a data warehouse and then start developing extract – transform – load (ETL) applications. However, most of BI projects have to deal with problems with data quality (DQ). Data quality can be a huge obstacle for a successful BI project. Of course, line of business applications suffer from poor data quality as well.
Every company has part of the data which is used everywhere, in every transaction, like customers data, products data and similar. Such data is called master data. People who manage master data are often called data stewards. Processes and activities for maintaining master data are known as master data management (MDM). In this presentation, we are going to discuss ETL, DQ and MDM problems and introduce how Microsoft SQL Server 2016 tools can help you with solutions.

## Title: Realizzare una vera Continuous Integration con SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Dopo aver messo i nostri database sotto Source Control e dopo aver scritto i nostri Unit Testing, andiamo a completare il processo di Continuous Integration automatizzando il processo di build. In questo modo avremo realizzato una vera ed automatizzata integrazione continua. In questa sessione andremo a mostrare come creare i trigger di automazione delle build dei nostri database (construzioni di database sandbox, separati dallo sviluppo) e come, di conseguenza, eseguire i test dopo una semplice operazione di checkin di un changeset. Affronteremo la problematica utilizzando TFS (o Visual Studio Online) e SQL Server + tSQLt

## Title: Using SQL Server 2016 and R Integration
 
**Abstract**:
With SQL Server 2016 (CTP 3 release) R Language for statistical programming is now supported with native T-SQL. With this extension we can now integrate powerful R Language with transactional data directly using SSMS.

In this session we will go through:
1) Installation needed (R and RRO by Revolution Analytics (now Microsoft)
2) Exploring the usage of RRO Engine (multi-threated usage and parallel multi-core usage of CPU,...)
3) Using T-SQL for Data analysis with importing and exporting data to SQL Tables
4) Demos with using Predictions on datasets and exploring usability of Reporting services (SSRS) and Power BI (integration with R now possible).

Session is useful for BI analysts as well as for DEV and DBA as we can easily make server monitoring and use of predictions for server monitoring (predicting when disk will be full and any other extended events).

## Title: Choosing the right mobile BI tool: SSRS vs Power BI vs Datazen
 
**Abstract**:
In 2015 Microsoft carried out the release of Power BI and the acquisition of Datazen. 
During 2016 many changes are expected mostly regarding Reporting Services as a tool for contents repository and delivery. 
This means that now developers have a wide range of tools available for reporting, dashboarding, data analysis, both for desktop and mobile devices. So the question is: which one to choose? 
What are the key factor for supporting the correct decision? What changes are expected in the next future?
This session we'll focus on mobile BI reporting; we will provide a clear and understandable overview of each product, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.
You'll be able to see how to develop and deliver mobile BI reports with Reporting Services, Power BI and Datazen. 
Based on some real examples we will set out a comparison matrix to find the best way to meet your needs with the right reporting tool.

## Title: Azure SQL Database (IT)
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server in una Virtual Machine #232; la classica soluzione IaaS nel Cloud, si tratta di un’ottima soluzione che ha il pregio della familiarit#224; e si presta bene a scenari di integrazione ibridi tra Cloud e On-Premise. Tuttavia, non riduce significativamente i costi di gestione ordinaria e le complessit#224; legate ai temi di scalabilit#224;, alta disponibilit#224; e disaster recovery. Azure SQL Database #232; la soluzione PaaS/SaaS che offre un servizio di database relazionale con una copertura funzionale ormai praticamente identica a quella del Database Engine di un SQL Server tradizionale con una riduzione dei costi di implementazione e manutenzione e il beneficio di nuove funzionalit#224; tipicamente introdotte in anticipo rispetto alle versioni On-Premise. Questa sessione #232; diretta sia agli sviluppatori che agli amministratori di database interessati ad approfondirne le funzionalit#224;, gli scenari implementativi e le differenze con offerte simili quali Amazon RDS.

## Title: New Security Features in SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will explore the new features introduced with SQL Server 2016 to enhance security. 
Always Encrypted is a new technology that protects your data not only at rest, but also throughout the whole interaction between the application and the database.
Dynamic Data Masking is another interesting feature that allows us to protect sensitive data by masking it to all users that don’t have enough privileges to see the actual contents.
Row Level Security allows showing to end users only the data they’re entitled to access, without changing the applications’ code.
We will demonstrate the use of these three features with example applications and we will explore the use cases where these technologies represent a big leap from previous custom implementations.

## Title: New life for Reporting Services: what'up in 2016
 
**Abstract**:
During 2015 PASS Summit, Microsoft announced a roadmap to harmonize and standardize its BI reporting solutions into one unique hybrid scenario.
Reporting Services will play a crucial role in this new architecture. Starting from 2016 release, Reporting Services will be the Microsoft's on-premises solution for BI report delivery, meaning that it will host on-premises standard report as well as mobile report as well as Power BI Desktop report. 
To achieve this goal Reporting Services has been completely revisited and redesigned.

Come to this session to have a preview of the new features developed for Reporting Service with the advent of SQL Server 2016.
Your BI reporting strategy for the future could be completely revisited as you learn how many amazing changes are expected in the next future.

## Title: SQL Server 2016 Query Store: un nuovo modo di monitorare le query
 
**Abstract**:
Query Store #232; la nuova funzionalit#224; di SQLServer 2016 che permette la storicizzazione nel tempo delle prestazioni delle query, oltre i riavvii della macchina.  Consente l'archiviazione delle prestazioni del piano di esecuzione e delle prestazioni delle query, permettendone l'analisi a posteriori.
Questo meccanismo permette di effettuare analisi sofisticate delle query e delle loro prestazioni: #232; possibile correlare il cambiamento delle performances a quello del piano di esecuzione o ad altri eventi, seguire nel tempo le prestazioni di determinate porzioni del codice, individuare regressioni oppure identificare le query che hanno degradato recentemente.
E possibile inoltre seguire nel tempo l’evoluzione di un piano di esecuzione di una specifica query in funzione di cambiamenti, quali cambio delle statistiche, modifiche dello schema o presenza di indici.
La sessione entra nel dettaglio della funzionalit#224; e ne illustra l’utilizzo in un’ottica di ottimizzazione e troubleshooting.

## Title: SQL Server 2016 Temporal Database Support (IT)
 
**Abstract**:
I database temporali sono oggetto di studio da lungo tempo, quasi dieci anni fa UGISS ha dedicato due sessioni a questo tema sia dal punto di vista teorico, che da quello pratico, pur non avendo alcun tipo di supporto specifico in SQL Server. La nuova versione 2016 introduce il supporto a tabelle temporali che mantengono automaticamente, e in modo trasparente, la storia delle modifiche e permettono analisi puntuali nel tempo in maniera pratica con apposite estensioni del linguaggio. In questa sessione faremo una breve revisione dei database temporali e vedremo in dettaglio il supporto in SQL Server 2016 con l'ausilio di svariate dimostrazioni pratiche.

## Title: SSIS Custom Data Flow Components
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) include several most important components required in data acquisition, transformation, and load operations. If the problem at hand demands a solution that cannot be solved using the built-in components alone, you can resort to the freely extensible Script Component, but when the circumstances also call for a more complex, and more robust solution, that will be deployed to more than one destination server, the more appropriate alternative is to design a Custom Component.In this session you will learn how this can be achieved, what advantages it provides, and how to perform even the most complex data transformations in a standardised and reliable environment.

## Title: The most prominent wait types of your SQL Server 2016 (IT)
 
**Abstract**:
Una query, durante la sua esecuzione, pu#242; essere sospesa decine o addirittura centinaia di volte. Una query rimane in esecuzione fino a quando, ad esempio, non richiede di accedere ad una risorsa esterna o fino a quando il thread che la gestisce non eccede il quantum di utilizzo della CPU. In SQL Server 2016 ci sono 831 buoni motivi per cui una query pu#242; attendere. In questa sessione, sulla base delle statistiche pubblicate dalla DMV sys.dm_os_wait_stats, verranno descritti e analizzati i wait type pi#249; frequenti in un carico di lavoro OLTP.
