## Title: Excel Services in SharePoint 2013
 
**Abstract**:
Excel has over the years become a very powerful BI tool and so has Excel Services in SharePoint.

We start with an overview of the new features in Excel Services in SharePoint 2013 and go on with the publish options with focus on the “Items in the workbook” option which is especially handy when you will embed in SharePoint without it resembles Excel too much. Second item on the agenda is the integration in SharePoint with a demonstration of three possibilities:
 (1) Full page - The lazy solution.
 (2) PerformancePoint Services Dashboard - The smart solution.
 (3) WebPart page - The customizable solution.

Last but not least the session will include “Tips  Tricks” including how to remove the Excel look. How to control the layout with “Named Items” and the "Name Manager" and how you can burst the limits from PivotTables with the of use "Cube Functions" and "Names Sets".

## Title: This is how developers might punish your database
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server has traditionally been the go-to database for software development teams looking for a way of persisting their data, but the recent NoSQL movement has rendered visible just how limiting the relational model can be - and that may have led people to use other kinds of databases, like key-value stores, document databases, etc.

SQL Server does have some ways of misusing it, though, that you might have  missed! In this session we’ll take a look at three alternative ways of using SQL Server, since we’ll see exactly how your favorite RDBMS can be turned into a document database, a reliable message queue, and an event store in a CQRS architecture.

Participants will get an introduction to all the mentioned concepts, and there will be code examples in C#.

## Title: Upgrading from SSIS Package Deployment to Project Deployment
 
**Abstract**:
Are you still using the package deployment model in your SSIS projects, but want to upgrade to the project deployment model? Are you unsure how to go from using package configurations, configuration files and the SSIS configurations table, to using parameters, environments and the SSISDB catalog?

In this session I will explain the differences between the package deployment model and the project deployment model, and show you step-by-step how you can upgrade your SSIS projects. You will learn how to configure the SSISDB catalog, set up environments and environment variables, work with parameters and monitor your projects.

## Title: Intro to R
 
**Abstract**:
R, a fantastic open-source language, will rock your world. 

Instead of showing you how to do dry old statistics and worrying about your random trees and bagging methods, this session is going to take you through the super-cool stuff. No TLAs allowed in this session, only cool terms like shiny  LaTeX! 

We're gonna get your data out of SQL Server in just a few lines, then we're going to chart it for awesomeness, and then the fun begins. 

We'll go through the easy experience of using shiny to make interactive, real-time reports. 

I'll show you how you can add markdown to the mix to replace  PowerPoint  Word so that you can save yourself months over your lifetime formatting bullet points and headers. 

By the end of this session, you'll truly know your Rs from your elbow.

## Title: End to end risk assessment – affordable solution using Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
Risk assessment is becoming an integral part of many organizations. In order to do it successfully you need to do it regularly and consistently. You need to register the risk factors, the risks them self, evaluate them and then plan the actions required to mitigate them. Besides the registration you need to have compelling and easy reading reports that help managers quickly find how the assessment is going. The familiar Excel interface helps assessors register the risk factors and risks and then plan the actions. The solutions then uses Power Query to load data into PowerPivot without overwriting and the Power View to report the results. The results can then be monitored in Power BI. 

This method can easily transfer to any other data collection solution such as budgeting or incident registration

## Title: A deep dive into SQL Server Plan Cache Management
 
**Abstract**:
As an experienced DBA you have probably asked yourself questions like how the memory is consumed, is my system well-tuned, and is my memory configuration well defined. In order to understanding such processes as local and global Memory pressure, caches concurrency, adding and removing plans from cache we will go through the internal organization of the plan cache, the metadata available, how SQL Server finds a plan in cache, plan cache sizing, and the plan eviction policy. We will point out the important cache consumers that affect your workload and how to get metadata about them, what are the thresholds in Cache Size Management. At the end you will understand how to monitor the memory consumers in your SQL Server, what are wait types that we need to look for, how to understand if your system is well-tuned and the memory configuration is well defined. You will have a clear understanding of cache plan problems and how to avoid them.

## Title: High Performance Statistical Queries
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Database Engine has so many business intelligence improvements that it might become your primary analytical database system. However, in order to get the maximum out of these features, you need to learn how to properly use them. This in-depth session shows some extremely efficient inventive algorithms for the statistical queries. The queries use Window functions, CLR aggregate functions, and other SQL Server capabilities. The session also explains the formulas and usage of those statistical procedures. This session is useful not only for BI developers; database and other developers can successfully learn how to write efficient queries as well.

## Title: FILETABLEs: What They Are and How to Use Them
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever had the need to access documents in your database as if they were files in the file system? SQL Server 2012 introduces a brand new method for managing large data objects (BLOBs) in a database. FILETABLEs provide access to data using Transact-SQL - just like any other table inside the database, while at the same time also provide access to the data using the operating system File I/O API - i.e. just like any other folder in the file system. In this session you will learn how to upgrade your document management solutions by migrating your large data to FILETABLEs. The session covers two most typical migration scenarios: migrating from a distributed data store, where files are stored outside the database, and from a homogeneous d

## Title: Shadow prediction: SQL 2014 spatial data types and astronomy well mixed
 
**Abstract**:
In the Wind turbine industry it is often desirable to know where a wind turbine casts its shadow as it can case annoyance to neighbours.
This session is supposed to be a more entertaining then practical exercise to combine scarsely used data types in unusual fashion, combined with a bit of astronomy and math, to calculate and visualize the relationship between sun and wind turbine purely by using SQL2014 Management Studio. 

The calculation of the daily path of a shadow can be seen as a rather complex three-dimensional problem. By turning around the perspective and 'painting' the picture of turbines in the sky this can be decribed as a much simpler two-dimensional problem on a sphere. For this the geography data type will be used and in turn the richness of its functionality demonstrated. Even a sufficient visualisaton is included in SSMS 2014.  Apart from 2-3 formulas everything will be handeled in SQL and no complex math is needed.

## Title: Professional Recycling - SSIS Custom Control Flow Components with Visual Studio Community
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) are an extensible data-integration platform. If the functionality of stock items do not suffice, the script component is the first point of extensibility. If these custom scripts are used in multiple SSIS packages/projects their handling gets quite cumbersome. For a professional recycling of (script) logic SSIS custom control-flow tasks are an option. With the announcement of Visual Studio Community edition there is no need of a full (and expensive) development environment. This session will cover the required tools, development tips  tricks and best practices for Custom ControlFlow development.

## Title: Azure SQL Database Tips and Tricks for Beginners
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft released SQL Azure more than three years ago - that's enough time for testing. So, are you ready to move your data to the Cloud? If you’re considering a business (i.e. a production environment) in the Cloud, you need to think about methods for backing up your data, a backup plan for your data and, eventually (sic!) restoring data. In this session, you’ll see the differences, functionalies, restrictions, and opportunities in SQL Azure and On-Premise SQL Server 2008/2008 R2/2012/2014. We’ll consider topics such as how to be prepared for backup and restore, and which parts of a cloud environment are most important: keys, triggers, indexes, prices, security, service level agreements, etc.

## Title: ( virtual ) SQL on Steroids
 
**Abstract**:
I/O performance and operational ease of use are key requirements for SQL Server deployments. While virtualization has delivered operational ease of use it has done so at the expense of I/O performance. This has resulted in excessive database tuning or expensive and disruptive infrastructure changes to alleviate the I/O bottlenecks. Database level In-Memory Computing while promising brings with it a slew of challenges including application rewrites. 

What if one could guarantee SQL Server latency would take a vacation as In-Memory performance would be smoking fast without any of the challenges that contemporary approaches incur? In this presentation Frank Brix Pedersen will introduce '( virtual ) SQL on Steroids' as a bullet proof way of providing RAM performance for SQL Server without any side effects, any application rewrites or changes to infrastructure.
