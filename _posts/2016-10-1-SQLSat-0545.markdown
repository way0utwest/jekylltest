## Title: Disaster Documents: The role of documentation in disaster recovery
 
**Abstract**:
I was an employee of a company that had an office in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.  Prior to that infamous date, I had written several departmental documents that ended up being critical to our recovery.  In this presentation, I provide a narrative of what happened in the weeks following 9/11, and how documentation played a role in getting the organization back on its feet.

While other disaster recovery presentations talk about strategies, plans, and techniques, this presentation focuses on the documentation itself.  We will discuss the documents we had and how they were used in our recovery.  We will also discuss what documents we didn't have, and how they could have made the process better.

## Title: Leaving the Past Behind: Rewriting Your Checklist for SQL 2016
 
**Abstract**:
How big should the page file be for Windows Server 2016? How many data files should SQL Server 2016's TempDB contain? What trace flags should we use by default now?
 
These are questions you addressed long ago in your setup checklist. You've spent a lot of time with that checklist, and you're sure it's perfect. Or is it? When was the last time you visited that checklist?  Does it make sense for SQL 2014? What about SQL 2016? Change is hard, and DBAs need to constantly challenge yesterday's best practices to ensure they meet today's business needs.
 
Join Microsoft MVP Mike Hillwig and his list of server administration best practices that need to be revisited for modern versions of SQL Server, especially SQL 2016.

## Title: Statistics  Cardinality – How they work to find data efficiently
 
**Abstract**:
Are your statistics up to date? 
Yes, it’s that dreaded phrase you hear all the time when it comes to performance tuning your SQL Server. What does it matter? Why should I care about statistics? Aren’t they automatic or something like that?
In this session we will go over why statistics matter, how they are generated, how they impact performance, and even how to maintain them. Once we have that all settled, we will take a quick look at how the cardinality estimator uses statistics to determine a ‘good enough’ plan to use. We will close out the session by taking a look at the performance impact from a simple upgrade of your SQL Server to 2014 and using the new cardinality estimator.

## Title: The Secret to High Performance Code...The Devil’s in the Data
 
**Abstract**:
You found code you need in a “Holy Grail” article complete with test data and tests across several methods “clearly” identifying the best one to use.  Excited at your good fortune, you quickly download the code, rerun the tests on your Dev box . It “passes” with flying colors.  You promote the code to production and go home on time for a change.
The next day, your boss and the DBA are waiting for you in your cube and, look, the DBA has a bat with your name on it because your code brought the server to its knees and the code failed.
How is that possible?  The answer is, “The Devil’s in the Data”.
Whether you’re an SQL “Newbie” or seasoned veteran, this “Black Arts” session will teach you most of what you need to know to build large quantities of just about any test data you might imagine and more quickly than you ever dreamed.  It’ll also show you how to avoid the pitfalls that lead to the DBA with the bat. ;

## Title: A Discussion on the Azure SQL Database Security for the Cloud Objectionist
 
**Abstract**:
This session is for the those who have security objections related to moving to the cloud or are interested in the security features of the of the Azure SQL Database, a relational database Platform as a Service offering in Microsoft Azure.  There certainly are Azure SQL Database features which have parity with SQL Server engine features (Always Encrypted, TDE, RLS, etc.).  But this session will take a look at security features focused on the Azure SQL Database; server firewall settings, Auditing  Threat detection,  Alert Rules, Role-based Access Control and configuring Azure AD Authentication.  If time permits, we will step through Dynamic Data Making via the Azure portal.  Hopefully the main take away will be a warm and fuzzy (and more secure) feeling about planning for cloud workloads.

## Title: Working with SSRS Data-Driven Subscriptions 
 
**Abstract**:
SSRS Subscriptions are one of the great things within SSRS to automate delivery of reports.  However, one of the more powerful methods of further enhancing this automation is by use of data-driven subscriptions.  Data-driven subscriptions allow us to determine at run time what subscribers and other parameters can be used for automating the generation of these reports.

We#39;ll begin with a quick overview of what the more familiar subscription functionality is and then quickly jump into what data-driven subscriptions provide for us.  We#39;ll then demonstrate from beginning to end how to implement data-driven-subscriptions.  Lastly, we#39;ll wrap up with any tips and tricks to enhance our process.

## Title: The Pros and Cons of Table Partitioning
 
**Abstract**:
Have you considered implementing SQL Server partitioning? According to Wikipedia, “A partition is a division of a logical database or its constituent elements into distinct independent parts. Database partitioning is normally done for manageability, performance or availability reasons, as for load balancing”.  Would you benefit from it or will it be a big headache for you?   In a very straight forward approach, I will introduce what, when, why and how to create partition.

In this session, we'll explore what happens when you create a new transactional publication: what happens during a snapshot, how data gets delivered to subscribers, and how you can monitor, tweak, and tune your publications. We'll also see some common trouble spots and how to identify them. There will be plenty of examples and demos and, yes, even some PowerShell!
