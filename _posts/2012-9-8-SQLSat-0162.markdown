## Title: Make Your Queries Fly With Columnstore Indexes
 
**Abstract**:
Do you want to speed up your reports over your large tables by 10, 20 or even 50x? Those are the performance improvements that Columnstore indexes can give you – when used properly.
Often touted as a “BI” feature, in reality columnstore indexes can benefit any workload that involves some sort of reporting on large tables. In this session, we’ll first discuss how columnstore indexes work. Once past the basics, we’ll dive in and get dirty, looking at how to rewrite existing queries and change database designs to get the most out of this new index type.
If you are running SQL Server 2012, you can add a columnstore index to your large tables and gain maybe 4x performance – or you can attend this session and make things really fly.

## Title: Optimizing Storage and Performance Using Page and 
 
**Abstract**:
Since SQL Server 2005, we've been able to use the vardecimal data type to store decimals efficiently. With SQL Server 2008 came row and page compression, resulting in much better options for compressing our data. However, neither row nor page compression are panaceas! In this session I'll walk you through the internals of row and page compression, and based on that knowledge, enable you to better evaluate when to use which type of compression, if compression should be used at all. Once used, how do we determine its effectiveness? What are the pitfalls? I'll give you a full tool belt of knowledge to bring home and put to use on your databases.

## Title: I work with SQL why should I care about SharePoint
 
**Abstract**:
SQL is fundamental to every deployment of SharePoint, and increasingly many organisations have or are planning some form of SharePoint deployment.  As a SQL Professional you can't ignore SharePoint, and instead you should be actively engaged in its implementation to be to better support the solution.  This session will be an introduction to some of the key considerations around SQL for SharePoint including different database, sizing, naming and a few common issues encountered.   It will also introduce the SharePoint integration to Reporting Services which has been enhanced in SQL 2012.  Finally it will make the case that you how and why you should get actively in your organisations SharePoint deployment.

## Title: Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!
 
**Abstract**:
Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!

## Title: Practical PoSh – Design and build larger scripts
 
**Abstract**:
"Practical Powershell – How to design and build larger scripts"The best Powershell scripts, in my humble opinion, will think like you would and will solve a problem or do a task for you in such a way that you can call the script nine out of ten times with minimal parameters and let it figure out what smart defaults to use.In this session we’ll build a (1) Powershell script to automate one of our many (dba/dev) tasks in order to save us a lot of time.I’ll show you how I design, build, test and debug the bigger scripts and we’ll put in all the bells and whistles that those scripts commonly have. (Like support for  –WhatIf and get-help etc.)

## Title: Welcome to the Licensing Nightmare
 
**Abstract**:
Are You remember "Sliders"? In my opinion Licensing World is similar to this series. How many time You tried to understand licensing? How many times You heard different opinions about same question? I'm sure, that You know what is CPU, CORE, SOCKET. Are You familiar with Processor / User / Device? And CAL / SAL/ SA too? Are You use SPLA program or just OEM or MOLP? Physical Instance, Virtual Instance, 90 Days, EULA, SPUR, LAR, Multiplexing, 5 Dollars (not 5 Cents)... It's not all the possibilities, if we are talking about licenses. Let's talk about it, from the Licensing Point of View

## Title: Merge-tastic: a better way of loading dimensions
 
**Abstract**:
The T-SQL Merge statement provides a world of opportunities to save a lot of time.In this session we’ll look at how merge can be used to perform complex multi-stage tasks such as loading data into data warehouse dimensions, including the handling of type 0, 1  2 slowly changing dimensions.I’ll present a summary of my MSc dissertation findings, comparing the performance of using T-SQL Merge against other more traditional methods of loading slowly changing dimensions in SSIS.We’ll also look at how we can use dynamic SQL to completely automate the generation of the merge statement, resulting in an incredibly simple meta-data configured dimension loads in your data warehouse.

## Title: Query Plan Operators Deep Dive
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will deep an in-depth look at some of the most common query plan operators. We'll look at what they do, how they do it and the circumstances in which they are chosen. 

We will look at the good and bad aspects of each and why sometimes they aren't the right tool for the job. 
Using lots of examples we'll investigate the usage and impact they have on your SQL Server.

Hopefully you'll walk away from this session with the knowledge which will give you a deeper understanding of your query plans

## Title: Inheriting a database for Developers
 
**Abstract**:
There are very few applications which are being developed from zero, the most are apps are simply inherited from previous development teams.

This session serves to show some easy implementable practices to follow after inheriting a database. Those practices allow to check some if the database design was done in regards to the actual data, or if while implementing some of the constraints and checks some tables were left behind. :)

The practices shown in this session will allow to check the database design and identify some of the possible performance degradations.

## Title: Improving DB Development with SQL Source Control
 
**Abstract**:
Keeping track of database versions, deployment scripts, and any number of ad hoc database changes is a pain. In this session, you’ll see how to manage database changes easily using source control within SQL Server Management Studio. Source controlling databases is faster than you think with SQL Source Control; you can track who made database changes, what they changed, when, and why.

## Title: 2 AM. A Disaster just began...
 
**Abstract**:
2AM. We sleeping well. And our mobile ringing and ringing. Message: DISASTER! In this session (on slides) we are NOT talk about potential disaster (such BCM); we talk about: What happened NOW? Which tasks should have been finished BEFORE. Is virtual or physical SQL matter? We talk about systems, databases, peoples, encryption, passwords, certificates and users. In this session (on few demos) I'll show which part of our SQL Server Environment are critical and how to be prepared to disaster. In some documents I'll show You how to be BEST prepared.

## Title: The Magic of SQL Server 2012 BI in SharePoint
 
**Abstract**:
This fast paced and fun session is a journey through business intelligence with SQL Server 2012 and SharePoint.  It begins in Excel and shows how PowerPivot can be used to build useful information, how the data can be fed to the desktop, and how a user can develop their own notifications from that data. It then moves on to transform the data into a more cube-like experience by using external data and shows how dashboards and presentation-quality visualisations can be built easily from tabular models.

Although this session is mildly technical, it is easy to grasp and uses 100% demos.

## Title: T-SQL : Bad Habits and Best Practices
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will go over several bad habits that are quite
pervasive in the SQL Server community, and show with demos and samples why
these habits can be bad.

  We'll also illustrate some good habits that are less common and why they
should be adopted.

  The goal is to have every user in the room walk away with immediately
actionable knowledge to improve their existing stored procedures, raise
their overall T-SQL skill, and change the way they think about writing
code.

## Title: SQL Server 2012 SSIS Change Data Capture
 
**Abstract**:
We are storing more and more data FACT  
We have less time to move data around our environment FACT 
Businesses want close to real-time analytics FACT. 
We therefore need to plan our data movement strategy better.  In this session I will show you the improvements to CDC being made in SQL Server 2012 and suggest why this is something you will want to know.

## Title: READPAST  Furious-Transactions.Locking.Isolation.
 
**Abstract**:
Do you really understand SQL Servers’ Concurrency behaviour?
Are you sure that Transactions are an ALL or NOTHING operation?
Do you believe Read operations cannot start a Transaction?
Do you really know if READ_UNCOMMITTED is safe for reporting?
Is being Optimistic really better than being Pessimistic?
Can SQL Server 2012 be the solution to all our problems or our worst nightmare?

I look forward to you joining me in this very revealing and thought provoking session where I will provide answers to all these questions and more and make you wish you had known all of this sooner.

## Title: Partitioning Design for Performance and Maintainab
 
**Abstract**:
Partitioning your data allows a whole host of benefits to the performance and maintainability of your databases but still seems to be a dark art known only to a few people.  With every release of SQL Server more features become available to help solve various problems and a lot of them require that your database has been partitioned for that feature to be used effectively.  The most recent feature requiring partitioning is Column Store indexes, without partitioning you would be required to drop them before modifying any data in the base table and then recreating them from scratch.

## Title: SQL Internal Storage
 
**Abstract**:
This session describes how SQL Server internally stores table data. Although you can use SQL without understanding the internals of data storage, a deep knowledge of how data is stored will improve the development of efficient applications. This session explores the basic of metadata that keeps track of data and index storage information.

## Title: What's new in SQL Server 2012 - TSQL
 
**Abstract**:
With the release of SQL Server 2012, the T-SQL language has been extended further to enable greater productivity and more optimal queries.
Following the ANSI SQL standard support has been included for PAGING and SEQUENCES. Many cumbersome sub-queries will be banished by the clutch of new analytic functions, but perhaps the biggest is the window framing extensions.  These now allow a true sliding window of data to process such common problems as rolling balances.

This will be a high-level look session, but will be diving a bit deeper to highlight some caveats as we go as its not all plain sailing.
