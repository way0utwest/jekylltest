## Title: Turn Runbooks into Notebooks: Handling Maintenance and Emergencies with Azure Data Studio
 
**Abstract**:
On-call DBAs have all had that phone call in the middle of the night: "the database is down, fix it now!" We start scrambling to piece together various scripts to analyze the emergency, mitigate the issues, and kick off a failover or similar fix to make the database happy and healthy once again. Even scheduled maintenance likely requires us to download scripts from a ticket, run the scripts, and screenshot the results for documentation. What if I told you that Azure Data Studio's notebooks allow you to execute T-SQL and PowerShell together to handle these processes from a single document that documents its own results and can be stored directly in source control? Join me in this demo-heavy session to see how we can handle real-world on-call situations using Azure Data Studio notebooks.

## Title: Using Open Source Software to Collect Performance Metrics
 
**Abstract**:
Ever had a manager standing over your shoulder, wanting to know why an instance is running slow or if it can handle additional workload? If only you knew what performance metrics to collect and had them for your existing instances to answer these questions. 

In this session, we will discuss sp_whoisactive and Query Store to track what queries are running. Then, we will be combining three open source tools – Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana – into an inexpensive and easy to set up system that collects performance metrics you can use to troubleshoot issues and answer important questions about your SQL Server instances, including your Linux SQL Server instances, Azure Managed Instances, and Azure SQL Databases. Attendees will see how easy it is to get good performance data and visualize it interactively, and combine with other tools to troubleshoot issues. Finally, we will look at a problem I solved using this solution as an example.

## Title: A DBAs Guide to the Proper Handling of Corruption
 
**Abstract**:
Corruption can strike at any time. As DBAs, how we alert, investigate, and respond can have a profound impact on our company. In this session we will learn how to detect and respond to various types of corruption. In this introductory session for beginners we will introduce the concepts around how to monitor and respond to corruption incidents in our databases.

First we will focus on ways to detect corruption early. This will include understanding tools available to us like DBCC CheckDB as well as the importance of testing our backups. We’ll also look at some sample scripts to automate corruption checks and common alerts we should have set up on our instances.

Then we will move onto how to properly manage an incident and discuss some common examples of corruption. We’ll look at how we can analyze the situation safely as well as point out various pitfalls that trip people up. We’ll also discuss when and how we may be able to fix corruption vs restoring the database.

## Title: Looking "Normal" and Seeing "Stars": Table Designs Working Together
 
**Abstract**:
Most database professionals know there are two different database design patterns - normal forms for OLTP databases and star schemas for data warehouses. We tend to discuss these separately. But these two designs actually work together when we create our table schemas.

In this session, we will review the basics of both normal forms and star schemas. We'll compare and contrast the two designs. We will then discuss how a normalized database design influences a star schema design and vice versa. 

By the end of the session, you will better understand how using the two designs together gives you a greater insight to how you use your data throughout its lifecycle.

## Title: D.R.E.A.M (Data Rules Everything Around Me) - creating a data-driven business culture
 
**Abstract**:
Deploying a new Big Data initiative is a daunting undertaking in its own right, which can lead many business leaders to forget a crucial piece of the puzzle - changing company culture. What good is new technology if it does not align with the way people in the organization actually make decisions? This session dives into how company leadership can effectively get organization members not just tolerant of, but EXCITED about new technology initiatives.
Attendees will learn:
- Where a data-driven culture really starts
- Why so many companies fail miserably at obtaining the "data-driven culture"
- The single MOST important factor that determines a successful culture shift

## Title: Data Virtualization with PolyBase
 
**Abstract**:
PolyBase is Microsoft's data virtualization technology, allowing you to integrate SQL Server with external systems such as Hadoop and Azure Blob Storage.  As of SQL Server 2019, PolyBase also allows you to connect to diverse systems such as Oracle, MongoDB, Cosmos DB, Teradata, Apache Spark, and even other SQL Server instances.  In this talk, we will walk through the mechanics of PolyBase, showing how we can write T-SQL queries to access data from heterogeneous sources.  We will investigate the Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) and other resources needed to tease out what the PolyBase engine is doing behind the scenes and where to go when things break down.  Finally, we will look at several interesting use cases for PolyBase in the modern data environment.

## Title: Performance Tuning Azure SQL Databases
 
**Abstract**:
Performance tuning is a critical skill for both DBAs and Developers, and it becomes even more critical when there’s a monthly cost attached to the performance of the database. How do you get the best out of that database when both the hardware and operating system are in someone else’s hands? Fortunately, Azure SQL Database provides several features that can be leveraged for quick and easy performance gains. 

In this session, we’ll cover three key performance tuning features; Automatic Tuning, Intelligent Insights, and Extended Events. Each of these will be reviewed specifically with a focus on how it applies to Azure SQL Databases. Attendees will learn how to take advantage of each of these features, allowing them to save both time and money, and ensuring that their Azure SQL Databases are performing at their best.

## Title: Learn How to Master DATETIME Functions Like a Boss in 59.5 Minutes or Less
 
**Abstract**:
Do you know the dates of the 1st Monday, 2nd Tuesday, 3rd Wednesday, and 4th Thursday of any month between the 22 weeks and 47 weeks of any given year? 
Do you know the date that Daylight Savings starts in Nashville 4 years from now?

Yup, those were silly questions. However, there is nothing trivial about working within the complexity of dates and times. Trains, Planes, and sometimes at automobile races depend on precise and accurate date-time recordings. 

In this demo-heavy presentation, we will answer the following questions and more:
When to use DATETIME and DATETIME2 and why.
How do you filter date ranges that will make SQL Server run faster?
How language and date formatting affect EVERYTHING.
What's the best way to work with functions relating to the current date and time.
What's the best way to properly use SWITCHOFFSET, TODATETIMEOFFSET and AT TIME ZONE Functions. 

So stop wasting time and get on board because it's about time for the plane to depart.

## Title: Lessons Learned from a Successful Enterprise Power BI Deployment
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI is an amazing tool for end-user analytics and reporting, but if you don't architect for it correctly it may not work right as an enterprise reporting solution. Come to this session to get actual implementation details from a real deployment that was completed for a mid-sized company (1,500+ employees) and is being used daily by more than half of the employees after only a few months of being live in production. Using demos and actual documentation you will see what you need to think of for a project like this. We will be covering architecture, implementation, governance, change control, and support to get a Power BI enterprise deployment working successfully from someone that has done it! Azure Analysis Services, Power BI Pro, and Power BI Premium will be discussed and how each is being used in this solution as well.

## Title: Determining the Cost to Move to Azure
 
**Abstract**:
You have read all about moving to the cloud, spoken to colleagues who are on it and even attended events where they told you about how great it is, and YOU ARE SOLD! You recognize the benefits of storing your SQL Server workloads in the cloud and ready for things to happen. Everyone agrees its the right answer, however, there is one problem. Your organization need to understand the expected costs before moving forward. Understanding the cost to move to Azure and its run rate are questions several companies struggle with and has led to several choosing to stay in their current state. It is not because the cost is too high as some may expect, but oftentimes because simply no one has any idea what to expect. 

In this session, I will walk you through steps that show you how to estimate the cost of your move to Azure and provide several unique considerations along the way that can have an impact on this. Next time someone asks how much, you will be ready!

## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
 
**Abstract**:
Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years, but are often thought of as old-fashioned. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against these standards and can be avoided by understanding the requirements, applying normalization, as well as a healthy dose of simple common sense. In this session I will give an overview of how to design a relational database, allowing you to work with the data structures instead of against them. This will let you use SQL naturally, enabling the query engine internals to optimize your output needs without you needing to spend a lot of time thinking about it. This will mean less time trying to figure out why SUBSTRING(column,3,1) = 'A' is killing your performance, and more time for solving the next customer problem.

## Title: How To Be The DBA When You Don't Have A DBA
 
**Abstract**:
Not everyone has a full time Database Administrator on staff, and in many cases the responsibility of managing the database server falls on the developers.  But as long as the backups are running successfully you're good, right?  Not exactly.  There is ongoing maintenance required to help ensure that your databases are running smoothly.  Are your statistics out of date?  Are your indexes fragmented?  When was the last time the databases were checked for corruption? Has your SQL Server been tuned to fit your workload, or are you still running with the less optimal default settings?

Tailored to the "Non-DBA", this session will cover these topics and more to ensure that you can avoid some performance issues you may not even realize you're having.  Discussing server settings, database configurations, and recommended maintenance, you will leave this session with the knowledge (and scripts!) you need to help ensure that your SQL Server and databases are in top shape.

## Title: CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming
 
**Abstract**:
This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.

## Title: PowerShell for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
PowerShell is a tool used by many people in DevOps and Infrastructure. Should the DBA get on board with using PowerShell? The answer is yes - as a DBA, PowerShell can have a significant impact on tasks that would be long and tedious with just T-SQL alone. Today there are specific modules that can be incorporated into PowerShell to help in automating every-day DBA tasks. Beyond that, PowerShell can be used to do things like automate deployments and audit permissions. 

In this session we will explore real-world examples and demonstrate how PowerShell can be leveraged by the DBA to not only improve efficiency but also streamline processes across an enterprise environment.

## Title: Secrets of the Plan Cache
 
**Abstract**:
You have heard of a query plan, right?  Perhaps even looked at one somewhere along the way.  Have you ever wondered what information might be buried in the plan cache, the courses of action having that additional information might lead you to?  Perhaps you have wondered what plans in the cache would benefit from those missing indexes or contemplated your cost threshold of parallelism, among other questions.  This session is designed to answer just that.  We will look at query plans without the pretty node icons and from there we will interrogate the plan cache thus putting its secrets to work for us.
