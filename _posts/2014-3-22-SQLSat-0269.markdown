##Title: How to become a BI Developer? ##
 
**Abstract**:
This is one of the most frequent questions I get from our website visitors (mainly as we provide BI Tutorials).

I have become a BI Developer and I would like to share my experience and thoughts (and get yours) during this session, which will include:

1) We are not born BI Developers and anyone has a chance to become one!
2) It is not easy but it is easier when you have a clear directions how to get there!
3) Permanent vs. Contractor brief explanation of pros and cons!
4) Money is important aspect so we will talk about salaries and contract rates!
5) My journey to becoming a BI developer was not easy and I have started from not knowing English (in 2005) and any aspects of IT and I worked very hard (and Katie; my wife was my main success factor!) but I no longer want to be a BI Developer so last point is where to go next?

##Title: Powerful T-SQL Improvements that Reduce Query Complexity##
 
**Abstract**:
We’ve all dealt with them: nightmare queries, huge, twisted monsters that somehow work, despite being ugly and unmanageable. The time has come to tame these beasts, and the solution is available now, in SQL Server 2012.
New T-SQL functions offer out-of-the-box solutions for many problems that previously required complex workarounds. Paging, Running totals, Moving aggregates, YTD, and much more comes at the power of your fingertips in SQL Server 2012. The only thing you need to do is learn the syntax. And that is exactly what this session is all about: a thorough description and explanation of the syntax, and loads of demos to demonstrate how you can use all these new features.
Attend this session to boldly take SQL Server where it has never gone before!

##Title: The Accidental Business Intelligence Project Manager##
 
**Abstract**:
You’ve heard that Business Intelligence projects are prone to failure. 
You’ve watched the Apprentice with Donald Trump and Lord Alan Sugar. 
You know that the Project Manager is usually the one gets fired. 
You know that a quick Bing search for ‘why do Business Intelligence projects fail?’ produces a search result of 25 million hits! 

Despite all this… you’re now Business Intelligence Project Manager – now what do you do? In this session, Jen will provide a ‘sparks from the anvil’ series of steps and working practices in Business Intelligence Project Management. What about waterfall vs agile? What is a Gantt chart anyway? 

Jen will give you some ideas and insights that will help you set your BI project right: assess priorities, avoid conflict, empower the BI team and deliver the Business Intelligence project successfully!

##Title: PowerShell for the curious SQL Server DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
As a SQL Server DBA you've probably noticed more and more talk of PowerShell over the last few years. You might have never used it, or perhaps you've even downloaded a few scripts to use, or started reading a tutorial, but aren't really sure what it can do for you?

Then this session is for you. Trying something new for SQL Saturday Exter 2014, this "session" is in fact 2 sessions long (don't worry, you'll still get a break for coffee half way through). 

By the end of them you should have a better understanding of what PowerShell is, and how it can be used with SQL Server, so you can  start writing your own scripts or have a better understanding of how a script you've downloaded works

Session 1 will be a easy high level introduction

##Title: 1, 2, 3, … wait… 1, 2, 3, … many… SQL Servers##
 
**Abstract**:
Quote: “A good DBA is a lazy DBA”. When you have to manage a few SQL Servers, it’s not that hard to be a lazy DBA and to automate your day to day activities. But when you have to manage over 100 instances, it can become a tough job. Just imagine how you will deploy a new maintenance job on all your instances? Are you going to connect to each server one by one? Not really… Microsoft provides an enhanced set of multi-server management tools. The purpose of this sessions is to point out which SQL Server tools you can use for multi-server management. The session is bulk loaded with demos and it will give you a good idea what features can be helpful in your environment.

##Title: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Automating Your BI Framework##
 
**Abstract**:
Quite frankly, some aspects of building out a business intelligence solution are tedious. As you cycle through iterations of your star schema, you’ll find that even a simple data type change in the data warehouse requires you to make corresponding changes to staging tables, SSIS packages, and SSAS multidimensional or tabular models that take a considerable amount of time to implement. But there’s a better, faster way!In this session, we’ll explore lessons from a project that required implementation of a framework to easily generate BI objects based on reusable patterns. We’ll walk through the decision points in the framework design, review the implementation steps, and see demonstrations of how easily you can make iterative changes to your BI solution’s design by using reusable design patterns. Whether you simply want to accelerate change management or reproduce objects in bulk on demand, this session will give you practical tips for automating these processes.

##Title: SSIS Custom Data Flow Components##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) include several most important components required in data acquisition, transformation, and load operations. If the problem at hand demands a solution that cannot be solved using the built-in components alone, you can resort to the freely extensible Script Component, but when the circumstances also call for a more complex, and more robust solution, that will be deployed to more than one destination server, the more appropriate alternative is to design a Custom Component.In this session you will learn how this can be achieved, what advantages it provides, and how to perform even the most complex data transformations in a standardised and reliable environment.

##Title: Let's cook  'best SQL Server DBA practices'##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will go through the topics of performance, scalability and availbility - the 3 core topics that every DBA needs to know. Performance is at the core and required for every database application (small or mission-critical). In this talk we will go through the concepts, tools and procedures that will help you in monitoring and start fine-tuning the performance or find the root-cause on your data platform. The subject covered here is excerpted from my book "Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 Administration cookbook" and "SQL Server 2012 Cube Security How-to". This will also be an ideal beginning for any IT person who is willing step-into DBA world.

##Title: Automate your SSIS development with BIML##
 
**Abstract**:
Ever tried to import a file with the Import/Export wizard?
Or created a bunch of SSIS packages to process a data warehouse load?
Then you know how much work it is to specify the metadata correctly just to create a package that actually works.
Wouldn't it be cool if you had a descriptive language which looks at your metadata and just created the packages for you?
This is what BIML is all about. 
In this session I explain what BIML is, how it works and I'll show you how you can generate your packages and quickly respond to changes.
You can expect a demo rich session with lots of notes from the field and practical examples.
This is not just for BI developers, DBA's or SQL dev's who need to import or export data occasionally will learn some quick and easy tricks as well.

##Title: SQL Impossible: Restoring/Undeleting a table ##
 
**Abstract**:
Yes, you read the title right. 
No, it's not about the usual "one table per partition" and "restore full backup then copy the data over" methods.
No, there are no 3rd party tools involved. Just you and your SQL Server. 

Yes, it's crazy. No, it's not for production purposes. And yes, that's why it's so much fun.
Prepare to dive into the world of data pages, log records, deletes, truncates and backups and how it all works together to get your table back from the endless void.

##Title: Remodel your old EAV design##
 
**Abstract**:
Sometimes you really need an EAV model. In most cases they are ugly and slow.
After this session you will have gained new insights how to turn your old, slow, EAV model into a slim superfast model.

There will be real life examples from a recent project. With the techniques displayed in the presentation, I cut the execution time down from 134 days down to 0.5 seconds and cut the storage need from 550GB to 45GB.

##Title: A real DBA don’t need a GUI -A Guided Tour of SQL Server Management Studio##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Management Studio is at the heart of any SQL Server DBA or developer’s day. We take it for granted  but rarely do we take a look at how we can customise or improve it to make our day to day work easier and more productive. 
This presentation will show you how to use SSMS and will look at many of the hidden features and shortcuts that you had forgotten about or didn’t know were there.
At the end of this session you will have learnt at least one new feature of SSMS that you can use to improve your productivity.

##Title: Policy-based what ? (Or how I learned to stop worrying and love PBM)##
 
**Abstract**:
Beginning with SQL Server 2008, Policy-based Management was added to the DBAs toolkit to ease administration, but it only goes so far. This session will cover the principles of PBM, and we'll take a look at how we can make it *work* for us, as opposed to just telling us something is not right. We'll cover PBM and it's insides, Alerts, Operators, Scheduled Jobs, and demo a real-world use when setting up databases.

We will also take a look at some of the tools that can assist with a consolidation project and some pitfalls that I have experienced on previous consolidation projects.

##Title: Hadoop for the Microsoft Guy##
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft have released a distribution of Hadoop targeted at making big data accessible to everyone.  Hadoop is different to SQL Server.  Not necessarily better, just different.  It is a tool for a job.  if you have only ever worked with an RDBMS such as SQL Server then Hadoop is going to play with your mind a little and you are going to need to rethink a few things.
This session is going to take Hadoop and break it apart.  I will also look at some of the tooling Hive and Pig.
Keep an open mind and let me show you that Hadoop has lots to offer.

##Title: Query Optimizer internals##
 
**Abstract**:
The query optimizer is at the heart of SQLServer.  Without it SQLServer would be a vastly inferior product, queries would have to be manually tuned at each and every turn, and generally speaking, the optimizer protects us from the complexities and mechanics involved.

Much of the optimizer's internal workings are hidden from the user, but can be revealed by using a selection of undocumented trace flags to gain further knowledge and insight into how your queries and data are processed to create a plan.

This session will be a deep dive into the optimizers' internals and not for the feint of heart.

##Title: Effective Index Partitioning, Compression Strategy##
 
**Abstract**:
We all know that ‘Indexing’ is KING when it comes to achieving high levels of performance in SQL Server. 
When Indexing also combines 2 of the Enterprise features: Partitioning  Compression, we can often see substantial gains.

Learn how to identify those objects that benefit greatly from being Partitioned or Compressed, OR combining both of these features to even greater effect.

Using Demos to illustrate the performance gains with real-world examples, Take away advanced scripts for use in your own environments.

##Title: Uncovering the hidden gems in execution plans##
 
**Abstract**:
We all know that the execution plan is central to understanding query performance, but the way we view the execution plan hides lots of good, useful information from us.   The plan is an XML document and knowing what attributes to look for can give you a better window onto your query's performance.  In this session Kevan will cover the attributes that he looks for, what they mean and what actions to take.  We may even get a sneak peak of what's to come in SQL 2014 too.
