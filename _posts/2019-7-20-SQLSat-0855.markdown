##Title: The Complete Guide to Temporary Tables and Table Variables##
 
**Abstract**:
It is very common to use temporary data structures in the database. In SQL Server, we can choose between temporary tables (#MyTable) and table variables (@MyTable). There are many differences between these two structures, some are obvious and well known, and some might surprise you.
The main difference in terms of performance is statistics, which exist for a temporary table, but do not exist for a table variable. For that reason, there can be a huge difference in performance of a stored procedure that uses one data structure or the other.
In this session, we will demonstrate the differences and analyze performance for various use cases. We will cover all kinds of ways to work with these data structures, such as OPTION (RECOMPILE) and trace flag 2453.
By the end of this session you will know exactly when and how to use each one in order to achieve the desired functionality with the best performance.
This is a must session for every SQL Server developer.

##Title: Staging data for Azure SQL services##
 
**Abstract**:
Most companies are faced with the ever-growing big data problem.  There have been two schools of thought on how to solve this problem.

Schema on write is represented by the traditional relational database table. Only a small portion of the total data owned by the company resides in the database.

Schema on read is represented by technologies such as Hadoop or PolyBase. All data owned by the company can reside in simple storage.

Today, we will learn how to stage data using Azure blob storage which can be ingested by both techniques.

1 – Grab some big data.
2 – Create blob storage account.
3 – Copy data to container.
4 – Azure SQL database plumbing.
5 – Loading data with BULK INSERT.
6 – Azure SQL data warehouse plumbing.
7 – Loading data with POLYBASE.
8 – Azure automation with RUNBOOKS.

##Title: Approaching Zero:  Minimizing Downtime During Deployments##
 
**Abstract**:
Negotiating a downtime for a release can be difficult in this modern, 24x7 world.  When downtime means lost revenue, the price of taking a downtime to deploy code can run up quickly.  This talk will show you a way to reduce the cost of deployment by reducing or even eliminating required downtime for database code deployment.  We will show how to release new database code, update existing stored procedures, refactor and restructure tables, and even perform systemic re-architecture with no downtime and minimal blocking.  We will use as a case study one release in which we modified the primary key column on 180 tables and updated over 550 stored procedures without end users noticing a thing.  If you want to hit that three nines (or better) service-level agreement, this talk will help get you on the road to reduced downtime.

##Title: SQL Server Reporting Services 2017 on Steroids!!##
 
**Abstract**:
Reporting requests that are required ‘yesterday or sooner’, oft times necessitate working more efficiently and effectively. We have all been through this at one time or another.
In this hands on presentation we shall be looking some of the more challenging techniques of extracting our data from our Multidimensional and Tabular Models, in addition to our Data Mining Models. 
We shall be utilizing concepts of  ‘Openquery()’ and ‘linked servers’ as a means to extract data,  in addition to looking at the way that these two concepts can help us extract our data utilizing MDX, DMX and DAX expressions;  AND YET maintain the  flexibility and the ability to utilize all those wonderful techniques that may  be done with T-SQL.

##Title: 4 Threats to your SQL Servers - Become Default: Secure##
 
**Abstract**:
In our connected world, the threat landscape is rapidly increasing. Phishing is leading to severe and crippling ransomware attacks. Malicious outsiders (and insiders) have cost much downtime. Not to mention the "traditional" threats such as "oops deletes" or site crashes. How do we protect against all of this? Is this even the DBA's role?

In this session, we'll explore 4 types of active threats to your data and organization. We'll talk about the various solutions available and help you see which threats you are vulnerable to if you've not gone far enough as we match threats and answers. Sadly, we'll share real stories of folks who've lost it all from these threats.

It's more than "take your backups, verify them, and periodically test them!" Ransomware and malicious outsiders (or insiders) eat your online backups for breakfast. 

Leave prepared, not scared, as you adopt a "Default: Secure" posture and lead the charge, even if we are "only" DBAs.

##Title: Performance Optimization with Azure SQL Database##
 
**Abstract**:
The cloud is just using someone else's compute. You still need to care about and optimize for performance.  Just as a dropped call frustrates cellular customers, an app with data issues, high latency, connection timeouts will create the same frustration for users.  Do you want to catch the performance issues before your customers?  Do you want to automatically identify database issues and quickly drill down into details? Azure provides built in tools just to do that. 
In this session I will show you 4 of those tools.  You will learn how these tools can provide Performance overview of a database and recommendations that can improve workload performance.  Find top resource consuming queries, deeper insight into your databases resource (DTU) consumption and learn when to let Azure  automatically optimize your database. 
 
At the end of this session you will walk out knowing how to identify and tune Azure SQL database performance  issues with built in tools in Azure Portal.

##Title: SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases##
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps is based on building an application binary (immutable artifact) that supports a highly reliable, repeatable engineering process.  In the case of SQL Server, however, a database is already in production, and isn’t simply replaced (as an app binary), but is upgraded.   Current SQL Server DevOps methods use source control to build a “development” database, with schema and objects and static data needed for functional testing.  "Near production data" is used in Staging, and finally production is upgraded.  This approach involves complexity, and breaks the principle of working with immutable artifacts throughout the process.  Our session introduces a new approach to SQL Server DevOps, with production databases used in all stages.   Production database clones are delivered more quickly than "built" databases, are more easily integrated with source control, and produces higher fidelity outcomes.  Learn how leading enterprises are simplifying SQL DevOps.

##Title: Azure Machine Learning 101##
 
**Abstract**:
There are several ways to create a machine learning model. You can use R or Python or even other languages such as C#. Advanced coding skills are required no matter which language you choose. Once the solution is created, it’s often difficult to deploy. 

Microsoft addresses those problems with Azure Machine Learning, or Azure ML. Azure ML has built-in transforms for cleansing and munging data. It also contains a variety of configurable machine learning models that can be used without coding. Deploying the model is easy, and users can link to it directly with Excel or a custom application can be written.

If you are experienced in machine learning but haven’t seen Azure ML or if you are curious about machine learning and data science, this session is for you.

##Title: Overcoming Challenges with Source Control and Continuous Integration.##
 
**Abstract**:
Have you tried implementing source control? How has your continuous integration (CI) process gone? 

This session is for developers, database administrators, database engineers, and data architects that want to automate their database deployments. Particularly for those individuals that have hit roadblocks along that way. We will discuss the differences between migration and stated-based deployment methods. We will also discuss options with branching and merging. 

At the end of the session, attendees will know how to select the best deployment method for their environment. In addition, attendees will be familiar with branching and merging strategies that can be used as part of their continuous integration strategy.

Attendees should be familiar with general concepts about source control and be comfortable with Visual Studio or VS Code.

##Title: Looking "Normal" and Seeing "Stars": Table Designs Working Together##
 
**Abstract**:
Most database professionals know there are two different database design patterns - normal forms for OLTP databases and star schemas for data warehouses. We tend to discuss these separately. But these two designs actually work together when we create our table schemas.

In this session, we will review the basics of both normal forms and star schemas. We'll compare and contrast the two designs. We will then discuss how a normalized database design influences a star schema design and vice versa. 

By the end of the session, you will better understand how using the two designs together gives you a greater insight to how you use your data throughout its lifecycle.

##Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source##
 
**Abstract**:
Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. quot;Virtualize Firstquot; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too quot;criticalquot; to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments. Got an SQL virtualization or performance question? Bring i

##Title: dbatools for the Uninitiated##
 
**Abstract**:
You’ve just inherited a large SQL Server estate, and next month’s merger will double the number of instances you’re responsible for. Or maybe you have one big instance with thousands of databases on it. Are there backups? Are they good? Are your systems in good health?

The department just decided to reorganize and consolidate databases to prepare for an upgrade to the next release of SQL Server. How are you going to manage all this?

It's time to automate with the dbatools Powershell module. We’ll briefly talk about the project itself, then take a tour of functions commonly used to manage SQL Server environments and data. When you leave, you’ll be ready to level up your administration toolkit and start reducing your daily workload.

##Title: Why candidates fail the job interview in the first minute##
 
**Abstract**:
In the last two decades I always had more open positions than I could fill, not because of lack of applicants, I must have interviewed close to 300 people for DBA, database developer, data architect, data modeling and other data related positions. Come to this highly interactive session to learn why 99% of the candidates failed the simplest questions and disqualified them self.

Thomas will share what he misses in resumes and how to respond to questions better.

##Title: Power BI with Maps: Choose Your Destination##
 
**Abstract**:
A childhood dream to travel around the world fueled by reading Gulliver's Travels stories and Robinson Crusoe attempts to survive on a deserted island. Those books were filled with geographical description and map locations. I think I always loved working with maps and I still do! There is something that could captivate your mind and propel your imagination for traveling when you immerse yourself in maps.

Power BI itself a great tool that could feed your appetite for an adventure using built-in and custom map visualizations. Let's explore them!

##Title: Pocket-sized Server: SQL Server for under $200!##
 
**Abstract**:
With a growing focus on large data solutions that span terabytes and use dozens of CPUs and vast amounts of memory, sometimes the smaller solutions are overlooked, especially when considering the Internet of Things where often you may want data collection close to the data you're collecting.
At the other end of the spectrum there's an amazing amount of power available in very small form-factors. This session will explore what can be done with cheap off the shelf "computers on a board" form factors and Linux to build cheap and easy to deploy small SQL solutions that can be useful for a variety of data collection activities.

##Title: Let's Dive Into SQL Server I/O To Improve T-SQL Performance##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you understand how SQL Server handles I/O? If not, you should. Understanding I/O is more important than ever with increasing cloud adoption, due to cloud costing models. But even on-premises, I/O has a direct impact on T-SQL performance.

Join me for a deep dive into the storage engine to understand how SQL Server handles I/O.  Concepts will be paired with T-SQL examples to illustrate the practical impacts. 

When you leave, you'll be able to optimize your T-SQL reduce I/O and improve performance across the board.

##Title: Python with SQL:  A Winning Combination##
 
**Abstract**:
You want to learn Python but don't know where to start?  You already know SQL, and data wrangling is one of the most critical use cases for Python.  Why not start with that?  Good news! Python provides many ways to use good old SQL as a first class query and data manipulation language.  In this session, we'll show you how easy it is to use SQL with Python to query non relational and relational database data, to load data from SQL Server, and write it back.  It's so easy, you'll feel like a Python pro before you know it!

##Title: What is DevOps and Why Should DBAs Care?##
 
**Abstract**:
You may have heard the term “DevOps” a lot lately, but is this just one of those buzzwords that gets thrown around and means something different depending on who’s talking? While traditional software methodologies pit developers and operations folks like DBAs against each other, DevOps requires that they work together for a common goal. And, ultimately, shouldn’t the software project’s success be everyone’s goal? 
Attend this session to learn how DevOps is changing the DBAs world for the better.

##Title: Blogging for Success: Advancing your career by blogging##
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wanted to start a 'blog, but have no idea how to do it?  It's easier than you think!  A number of people have become successful by writing 'blog articles.  I originally started my 'blog to supplement my presentations.  Since then, it's taken on a life of its own.

In this presentation, I'll tell you how I got started with 'blogging, where it's taken me since then, and lessons I've learned along the way.  We'll discuss 'blog platforms, how to get started, what to write about, and what to do (and what NOT to do) when writing articles.

##Title: Networking 101: Getting Ready for a SQL Event##
 
**Abstract**:
Looking to get the most out of your SQL Saturday, PASS Summit, or local user group meeting? Plan ahead!  Events aren't just about learning new things, they're about meeting new people, networking with peers, and learning different approaches to common issues.

In this session, we'll go over steps you can take before, during and after the event to maximize the amount of great stuff you'll take away at the end (besides cool vendor swag).  Not just keeping up on new technologies, but meeting new people, getting leads on solutions/opportunities, and an appreciation for the community you're in and what it has to offer.

##Title: Extend Power BI with Python##
 
**Abstract**:
Most developers use Power BI desktop to design the visuals and publish to the Azure service for production. 

Out of the box, Power BI has 29 visuals.  There are 208 custom visuals that can be down loaded from Appsource.Microsoft.com. 

While there are many choices, the business problem might not have an out of the box visual that can be customized the way you want.  How do you solve this problem?

This is where the custom scripting with Python visual comes in.  

At the end of the presentation you will know which libraries that you can use to extend your toolbox for both on premise and the azure service.
