## Title: Pay less, get more, a guide to SQL Server Licensing
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, we will talk about how you can save money by right-licensing SQL Server. Some people consider SQL Server licensing as the “elephant in the room” while others refer to it as “something that no one wants to own, but know they need to sort out.”
SQL Server licensing is a complex beast. It is not always transparent and straight forward to understand what licensing you need. In this session, we will look at how you best license your SQL Servers to get the best return on investment.
We will discuss
•What SQL Server editions you need to license
•SQL Server and software assurance – why you might need both
•How can you buy your licenses?
o	On-premises
o	Cloud
•Licensing models
o	Core-based
o	Server+CAL
•How to license SQL Server in a virtual environment
•Licensing scenarios
o	High availability
o	Application mobility
o	Non-production
o	SQL Server on containers

## Title: An Architects Guide to Delivering Data Insights on the Microsoft Azure Data Platform
 
**Abstract**:
The resources on offer in Azure are constantly changing, which means as data professionals we need to constantly change too. Updating knowledge and learning new skills. No longer can we rely on products matured over a decade to deliver all our solution requirements. Today, data platform architectures designed in Azure with best intentions and known good practices can go out of date within months. That said, is there now a set of core components we can utilise in the Microsoft cloud to ingest and deliver insights from our data? When does ETL become ELT? When is IaaS better than PaaS? Do we need to consider scaling up or scaling out? And should we start making cost the primary factor for choosing certain technologies? In this session we'll explore the answers to all these questions and more from an architects viewpoint. Based on real world experience lets think about just how far the breadth of our knowledge now needs to reach when starting from nothing and building a complete solution.

## Title: Database CI/CD with Containers and Azure DevOps
 
**Abstract**:
Containers are becoming ever popular but other than spinning one up to have a play around with the latest SQL Server 2019 CTP's new features, what else can they be used for?

In this demo heavy session we will show how Containers along with Azure DevOps can work for your CI/CD pipeline.

You will leave this session with the knowledge and ability to start creating your own bespoke SQL Server on Linux development / testing environments with automated image builds and releasing to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) along with some of the issues / pitfalls of doing so. 

Pre-Requisite:
To get the most out of this session a basic understanding of what Docker/Containers are, is recommended.

## Title: Tips  Tricks of a Power BI Implementation at a Financial Institute
 
**Abstract**:
Back to September 2016: Power BI is new, shiny and hot. It is the tool of the moment, so people cannot wait to get their hands on it.
Fast forward 6 months, there is more traction within the business, training is given and workshops are held. The adoption of Power BI is growing. Some departments already use Power BI very extensively and incorporate it in their day-to-day processes. Due to this quick success there is uncertainty regarding the right support team for incidents and problems.
Because an app workspace creates an Office 365 group with a lot of artifacts behind the scenes, the creation workflow is controlled by IT. Unfortunately this inhibits the end users.
We require more governance, not to further bother the users, but it is essential to stay in control. Responsibilities need to be better aligned between IT and the business.
Throughout this session we take you along on our Power BI journey, with tips, tricks, do's and don'ts during the implementation of Power BI (Premium).

## Title: Azure Data Factory, your data pipeline in the cloud
 
**Abstract**:
Before data can be analyzed it must first be converted and copied into a format and a location where the analysis is the easiest. ETL tools (Extract, Transform, Load) make this possible. But if the data is needed in the cloud, it’s best to run the ETL in the cloud as well.
Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based ETL tool, allowing data to be copied from on-premises as well as cloud based locations. Transformations can be hand-coded, but recently Microsoft added data flows to the product, which allow you to do data transformations without the need to write custom code.
In this session you will see the product in action and learn how to get started building your own flows.

## Title: The databases in SSDT - a work with project and best practices
 
**Abstract**:
A task seems to be easy. Maintenance a project of a database in the code repository, treat as master-version and do deployment evenly and frequently. Simple? Seemingly. The things become more complex as fast as a number of objects in database growing. While instead of one database, we have over a dozen. When databases have got the references to each other. And how about dictionary tables? Where to keep them and how to script? Additional issues are coming whilst we would like to control instance-level objects.
All these topics I will explain in the session focused on practical aspects of work with Microsoft Visual Studio Data Tools.

## Title: Troubleshooting Power BI Report Performance
 
**Abstract**:
So you've built a Power BI report with all the shinies? Good! 
After some usage, users have reacted that it's a bit sluggish in usage, and they're not keen on using it anymore.

Starting off with the new Performance Analyzer Pane, we'll demonstrate how you can pinpoint bottlenecks in your report, and take actions on these insights.

With the myriad of root causes that are out there, an elimination approach might suit us very well. 
Some of the main causes will be explained, and we'll get you going on how you can fix it for yourselves.

Be it DAX-measures, modelling issues, or an overload of visuals. 
Every report can be tuned to handle like a dream, and you can do it too!

The session explains what Power BI Embedded is, how to embed reports into ISV application works. Also, the session clarifies the licensing aspect and gives information about the maintenance of this architecture.

We'll start by the use-cases or if you prefer "when is it smarter to switch your good old SSIS for the new tools". Then we'll take a look to a data preparation and a data move with Databricks and we can automate its execution. Finally, we'll go for a few tips with the tooling.
