##Title: Generate SSIS packages automatically with Biml and BimlScript##
 
**Abstract**:
SSIS is a powerful tool for extracting, transforming and loading data, but creating the actual SSIS packages can be both tedious and time-consuming. Even if you use templates and follow best practices you often have to repeat the same steps over and over again. There are no easy ways to handle metadata and schema changes, and if there are new requirements you might have to go through all the packages one more time. It's time to bring the Don't Repeat Yourself principle to SSIS development.    In this session I will use the free BIDS Helper add-in to show you the basics of Biml and BimlScript, how to generate SSIS packages automatically from databases, how easy those packages can be changed, and how to move common code to separate files that can be included where needed. See why they say Biml allows you to complete in a day what once took more than a week!   This session is intended for SSIS developers who are not yet familiar with Biml.

##Title: Deadlocks. Everything that developer needs to know##
 
**Abstract**:
It's no secret that a deadlock - it's not very good. This is an exceptional situation, when two concurrent queries request same resources, but in a different order. Classic deadlock can occur when two concurrent transactions modifying data from the two tables in a different order. Unfortunatelly in real life deadlocks can be more complex and unobvious. One of the rules, which I always keep in mind, sounds: " You can not design a database, in which the occurrence of deadlock is impossible". So we should deal with them. The algorythm is following: catch, analyze, fix. The most challenging and interesting here is the analysis part. Once you understand why it was occured, you can fix it. In this session we will focus on the analysis of complex,

##Title: Optimizing implementation techniques ##
 
**Abstract**:
This session describes some performance boosters as well as performance killers and some techniques that can lead T-SQL queries, functions and stored procedures to take a few seconds instead of lots of minutes to execute. For instance: - What is best, CTE’s or Temporary Tables? When? - When joining more than two tables (or intermediate result sets), should we still care about the join order? - Did you ever expect to see an Index Seek in your execution plan but what you find is an Index Scan, although you took care of parameter sniffing and your statistics are updated? - Do you care about what isolation level you use? Using real life based demonstrations, this session will provide answers to these and other questions.

##Title: Enter the Dragon: Running SQL 2014 on Windows Server Core##
 
**Abstract**:
In 1982 the Dragon32 entered the home computer market but unfortunately there was one small problem ...lower-case letters were almost impossible to access. Two years later Dragon was no more. In 2008 Microsoft released ServerCore providing a fast and streamlined (but reduced functionality) edition of Windows with minimal GUI support and with Windows 2012/R2 Server Core is "by default". Ever since SQL 2012, installation onto Server Core became a "supported" option and meant the single biggest administrative shift for a DBA since the release of SQL 2005 ...or did it? In this exciting session we will discuss administration, configuration and installation of both SQL 2014 and ServerCore in both standalone and advanced AlwaysOn configurations but will the lack of GUI support send Server Core in the same direction as the Dragon32 or spell a bright new beginning for Server based computing and SQL Server? Join me, and this time, listen to the Dragon roar!

##Title: 10 tips everyone should know about powershell##
 
**Abstract**:
If you are not using powershell once in a while, then you really need to attend this session. We still find many people compiling small Console apps, or building expensive configuration UIs, but what we need in operations is a good script. Let’s learn why scripts are safer, easier to maintain and debug in production. Because the language and the runtime platform are also huge in terms of programming styles and wrappers (COM, WMI, Registry, XMLDOM, DOS, DotNet), there are always many ways to do it. In this session we will dig into some of the tips that can make our scripts much easier to use, learn and maintain.

##Title: Because the world is not just relational - Intro to RavenDB##
 
**Abstract**:
RavenDb is a .NET document database with an HTTP REST API, Lucene based indexes, ACID read/writes and BASE queries that's been picking up steam in the .NET space.
In this session we'll see the very basics of using RavenDB from a web application, including reads, writes and simple queries. We'll see how RavenDB uses LINQ and Lucene to create indexes similar to materialized views to provide fast query-time responses,  and what are the main differences in modeling data and entities from the perspective of a developer used to relational databases.

##Title: Building abstract layers for data protection and business logic##
 
**Abstract**:
Many developers are working with direct access to the data layer of a database (tables) by ORM or .NET, Access, ... This access methode maybe a good choice for small applications which use a dedicated database where no security or business requirement is needed.

This session demonstrates the protection of data by using schemata for data protection and implementation of business logic for multiple applications. I will demonstrate the usage of schemata in an application life cycle to reuse codes for reporting in the same way as for the web application or the fat client application.
