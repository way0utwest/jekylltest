##Title: Eyes on the Prize:  Simple and Effective Dashboard Visualization Techniques##
 
**Abstract**:
When done right, data visualization informs users quickly and efficiently with a minimum of distraction.  When done wrong, we end up with spinning 3D pie charts.  In this talk, we will look at techniques for effective dashboard design, minimizing noise and clutter (like spinning 3D pie charts) while providing relevant information to the intended audience.  We will see how different types of charts work, build out rules of thumb around which charts to use, and integrate visuals to create a coherent dashboard image.  When it comes to dashboards, we will compare and contrast dashboards based on their intended uses, such as interactive dashboards versus TV dashboards.  Finally, we will take an awful dashboard and turn it into something which end users will appreciate.

##Title: New Frontiers: Platform Independent Full Stack Development##
 
**Abstract**:
For years, those of us who wanted to use non-Windows-based machines to do .NET or SQL Server development have been caught in a "worst of both worlds"-type of situation. We have had to use some sort of Windows VM or have had to go without a local copy of SQL Server. The good news is that thanks to Microsoft's efforts, we can now do full stack .NET development without ever touching a Windows VM or work arounds! In this talk, I'll live code a simple service with database back-end while introducing platform independent tools such as Visual Studio Code, SQL Operations Studio and SQL Server for Docker. Along the way, I'll discuss key differences and limitations between the Windows tools and their platform independent counterparts.

##Title: SSDT, Docker, and (Azure) DevOps: How to Make Your Database Builds a First Class CI/CD Citizen##
 
**Abstract**:
Your application developers benefit from Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices to accelerate feature deployment and catch regression issues up front, but your database deployments are still stuck in the proverbial dark ages. The build scripts might be in source control or even an SSDT project already, but deploying is still an exercise in creating the perfect script, and don't even think about making a data (or data type) change!

SSDT and Azure DevOps can solve some of these problems, and even give us a window into the world of automated testing. In this talk, we will explore how to automate your database builds and deployments using SSDT and Azure DevOps, and we will explore automated testing using tSQLt and Docker. Lastly, we will check up on some tasks that you cannot (or should not) automate and talk about how to make sure your application developers are not left behind.

##Title: Everyone Has a Story to Tell: Developing Your First Presentation##
 
**Abstract**:
Ever considered giving a presentation of your own? Pondered how your favorite speakers got their start? Contemplated whether you could ever do that too, but were not sure where to begin?

Well I say you can and will show you how to get started! In this session, I will teach you how to develop your idea and create session content, and share tips  tricks that I have learned along the way. 

You will leave armed with a wealth of resources (and hopefully some inspiration) to venture forth and develop your first presentation.

##Title: Practical SQL Server Internals for T-SQL Developers##
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wonder how the SQL Server storage engine processes your T-SQL queries? Curious about what else you could be doing to improve query performance?

Having basic exposure to SQL Server Internals enables one to write more effective T-SQL. Join me as we peek into the black box of the storage engine. Topics will include an overview of the storage engine, indexing, and the query optimizer, accompanied by practical consequences and solutions.

When you leave, you will have a greater understanding of the storage engine and how to avoid T-SQL design patterns that negatively impact performance.

##Title: Handling Role Playing Dimensions in Tabular Models##
 
**Abstract**:
Most data models contain at least one situation requiring role playing dimensional behavior. For example,  Order Date, Ship Date, and Invoice Date all linked to the Date table. The tabular model, available in Power BI, Power Pivot, and SQL Server Analysis Services, provides multiple methods for handling role playing dimensions. In this session, we will implement examples of each of these alternatives, including the DAX expressions required to fully exploit each one. We will explore the strengths and weaknesses of each approach as well as best practices when implementing each of these alternatives. Special emphasis will be given to model maintainability as well as the experience created for users exploring and analyzing the model.

##Title: Learn History from Temporal Tables##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2016 came out with a bucket full of cool new features. One of them is Temporal Tables. SQL Server 2017 made some enhancements in this area. Temporal tables are basically history tables of the normal tables; that allows us to retrieve data from any point in time for every change such as updates and deletes. It does this all without any change to application code and without needing any triggers. In this session, we will see what the requirements of creating temporal tables are. We will see the demo on insert and update functionality and how to query historical information using new TSQL clause. We will touch upon retention of history as well. It has lots of demos and less theory.

##Title: JSON for the Data Mortals##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you see curly brackets stored in your database and wonder what that is? Are you a DBA, with developers storing JSON in your database? As a database administrator or developer, it's important to understand JSON today.  This session will explain what JSON is, where it came from, and why it is showing up all over the place.  When you leave this session you will understand how to investigate, manipulate, and validate JSON in your database.  You will walk away with example code of how to use Microsoft’s additions to SQL Server to use this data.

##Title: Principle of Least Privilege: The Key to Strong Security##
 
**Abstract**:
A truly strong security model starts with no permissions and adds what is necessary to allow the user or application to do their assigned task - no more, no less. This is called the Principle of Least Privilege. It's a simple concept, but it can be quite difficult to implement in practice, especially if the prevailing practice has been much more permissive.

In this session, we'll talk about the Principle of Least Privilege in more detail, and we'll discuss ways to implement it for the three primary classes of users - general users, applications, and administrators. Each has their own set of needs that requires a separate approach to allowing the security to meet those needs. You'll leave with actionable ideas on ways that you can improve your company's security while minimizing the impact of the changes.

##Title: Introduction to ETL with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, geared toward beginner level users, attendees will be introduced to SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) as an ETL tool. We will review the SSIS workspace and toolbox to familiarize users with the various features offered and how to navigate between them, as well as discuss their functionality. We will then build an SSIS package to extract data from a flat file source and load it into a SQL Server Database. The session will conclude by reviewing best practices surrounding the documentation of SSIS solutions, and attendees will receive a copy of documentation describing the package we created. 

This session is designed for users with little to no familiarity with SSIS who are looking for a baseline understanding of the tool, or who want to begin working more with SSIS development but do not know where to begin.

##Title: COSMOS DB Develop Local Deploy Globally##
 
**Abstract**:
CosmosDB is Microsoft’s globally distributed, massively scalable, cloud based database that is hosted in AZURE.  Who cares?  You should if you need to support thousands of transactions a second, global distribution and redundancy, and different consistencies.  

Do you need to support JSON, Graph, et al?  Done.  Join me and see how easy it is to get started.  We will set up a local instance of CosmosDB, load JSON data and build a PowerBI visualization. Along the way I’ll point out a couple of things to watch out for.  At the end of the session you will then learn how, with a couple of commands, to switch your visualization to the cloud.

##Title: Relational Data Architecture 101##
 
**Abstract**:
This presentation is a quick introduction for the DBA or developer who was just told that their boss promised a major new customer a scalable, well designed database. The customer will pay a lot of cash and years of ongoing business using this database… If you deliver it this week!

You’ll get a big bonus if you build this right, but you also remember what your co-workers did to the person who bungled the last database design… and wonder if that designer ever recovered! This session will introduce you to the fundamentals of Datatypes, Relational Algebra, and Normalization to help you avoid the major pitfalls and maybe get some sleep too!

This presentation is a survey of Data Architecture for the Intermediate DBA, it is not intended for experienced Data Modelers.

##Title: Always Encrypted - Now with Enclaves!##
 
**Abstract**:
Always Encrypted was introduced in SQL Server 2016, and it was a big step forward for encryption - but it had a very long list of exclusions which prevented it from being adopted by many organizations. Now, with SQL Server 2019, Always Encrypted is getting some much-needed improvements to its functionality. By utilizing the secure enclave capabilities of Windows 2019, SQL Server adds some impressive new abilities to work with data while it is encrypted. In this session, we’ll explore the secure enclave, and we'll see how you can leverage the new capabilities of Always Encrypted in your environment.

##Title: APPLY Yourself##
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.

##Title: Tracking Data Transformations Using Temporal Tables##
 
**Abstract**:
Along with change tracking and change data capture Microsoft has introduced a new method for tracking data changes within its databases called Temporal tables.  Microsoft introduced temporal, or system-versioned, tables in SQL Server 2016 as a new database feature. A temporal table truly introduces two tables into the mix: one for current data and another for historical data. This talk will show how the feature is implemented and used along with a discussion on the common usage for temporal tables. Comparison to change tracking and change data capture will also be discussed. Scripts will be explored for the automation of the creation of temporal tables along with its use in data warehousing.

##Title: Get Near Realtime ETL with Service Broker##
 
**Abstract**:
Most of the time you’ll see ETL being done with a tool such as SSIS, but what if you need near-realtime reporting? You need to get the updates in your OLTP database to the Data Warehouse quickly, but with minimal impact on your application. This session will demonstrate how to keep your data warehouse updated in near real-time using Service Broker messages from your OLTP database.

##Title: Diagnosing and fixing deadlocks in SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
You know how locking works in SQL Server, but now you are tasked with diagnosing and fixing deadlocks. How do you take the knowledge you have and apply it to address deadlocks in your production database?

In this session, we will discuss how you can use free tools to detect and analyze deadlocks in your system. We will do a deep dive on deadlock XML with an eye toward interpreting the information automatically collected by SQL Server when the free tools fall short. 

Attendees will leave with the understanding they need to develop solutions to deadlocks in their systems.

##Title: Refactoring Monolith Database Stored Procedures##
 
**Abstract**:
We get it. Move fast and break things. Just ship it! But what's left a giant stored procedure with cursors, temp tables, and mystery calculations. It's a big black box that nobody wants to touch. Let's fix that. We'll open the lid on an example monolith and do major surgery. What's left will perform better, be easier to understand, encourage code reuse, and be easier to test.

##Title: #GetModern with Dell EMC##
 
**Abstract**:
Consistent and predictable performance is critical for any successful deployment of Microsoft SQL Server. All-Flash arrays have been available for years and sub-millisecond response times should be the expectation. Maximize the performance and agility of your environment and learn how to automate and leverage self-service for snapshots of your databases for protection and re-purposing. Test/dev infrastructures can be refreshed from production DBs in minutes rather than hours or days. Stop working harder and slower than you need to be, learn how you can leverage Dell EMC. Whether storage, servers, networking, data protection, converged or hyper-converged… we have you covered.

##Title: Real-Time IoT Analytics at the Edge (Double session length)##
 
**Abstract**:
As the velocity of device data increases, the promise of the Cloud is often limited by the latency of the office Internet connection.  Leveraging the power of Azure, we will deploy real-time analytics at the edge and illustrate how performing high-frequency analysis is possible.

In this session, we will cover the basics of Azure Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Stream Analytics, then we will deploy Stream Analytics at the edge using a Raspberry Pi device connected to the Azure IoT ecosystem.

No prior Azure IoT or Azure Stream Analytics knowledge is required to benefit from this session.

After being recruited by Epic to be a Business Intelligence Developer, I eventually transitioned to a specialized developer in Epic that focused on tackling difficult reporting concepts for customers with SQL and Oracle. Wanting to grow my career further, I joined Talavant in July of 2018. My goal with Talavant is to help provide Pythonic solutions whether it be data transformations, artificial intelligence or automation-focused applications. Python is my preferred coding language as I believe it provides the flexibility to tackle a wide range of problems and can be used to help marry the gap between data engineering and data science.

I graduated from Johns Hopkins with degrees in both Mathematics and Economics. After being recruited by Epic to be a Business Intelligence Developer, I eventually transitioned to a specialized developer in Epic that focused on tackling difficult reporting concepts for customers with SQL and Oracle. Wanting to grow my career further, I joined Talavant in July of 2018. My goal with Talavant is to help provide Pythonic solutions whether it be data transformations, artificial intelligence or automation-focused applications. Python is my preferred coding language as I believe it provides the flexibility to tackle a wide range of problems and can be used to help marry the gap between data engineering and data science.

I graduated from Johns Hopkins with degrees in both Mathematics and Economics. After being recruited by Epic to be a Business Intelligence Developer, I eventually transitioned to a specialized developer in Epic that focused on tackling difficult reporting concepts for customers with SQL and Oracle. Wanting to grow my career further, I joined Talavant in July of 2018. My goal with Talavant is to help provide Pythonic solutions whether it be data transformations, artificial intelligence or automation-focused applications. Python is my preferred coding language as I believe it provides the flexibility to tackle a wide range of problems and can be used to help marry the gap between data engineering and data science.

Wanting to grow my career further, I joined Talavant in July of 2018.

**Abstract**:
Every expert has their own set of tools they use to find and fix the problem areas of queries, but SQL Server provides the necessary information to both diagnose and troubleshoot where those problems actually are, and help you fix those issues, right in the box. In this session we will examine a variety of tools to analyze and solve query performance problems.

##Title: Performance tuning with SQL Server memory grants##
 
**Abstract**:
When you're performance tuning queries with memory grants, you want to know where, how and why the memory is granted and used in your query.

In this session, we'll talk about analyzing requested and granted memory inside execution plans, the plan cache, and in currently running queries.

We'll also talk about troubleshooting your system when many queries have memory grants. 

Prerequisites: General knowledge of execution plans and query writing

##Title: Improving Columnstore Load Scalability on Large Servers##
 
**Abstract**:
Clustered Columnstore indexes can be a great solution for data warehousing workloads, but loading lots of data as quickly as possible is still an arcane art. We will walk through how to improve scalability of two common loading patterns using lessons learned from production workloads involving billions of rows. Come to this session to improve your Columnstore load times, to learn about scalability on large servers, or simply to be challenged.

##Title: Azure Data Factory V2: The cloud SSIS we have been waiting for?##
 
**Abstract**:
Azure Data Factory V2 is relatively new in Azure and has a lot of great new SSIS-like features but is it good enough to replace SSIS? In this session we will go over some of the new control flow, branching, and scheduling features in Azure Data Factory and see how to make a fully cloud capable data orchestration engine. As a bonus we'll also show how you can run SSIS packages directly in Azure!

##Title: Query Optimization Explained in 15 Demos##
 
**Abstract**:
You've got the hang of writing queries and creating indexes, but once you hit F5 you have no idea what's going to happen. 

* Why did I get that plan? 
* Why didn't you use that index?
* Why are you slow?

In this session, we'll look a little deeper into query optimization, and why SQL Server makes the choices it does. 

This will be fast-paced, demo-heavy and slide-light.
