## Title: SQL Server R Services in SQL 2016
 
**Abstract**:
One of the most exciting new features of SQL Server 2016 is the integration of the R statistical programming language into the platform with the brand-new SQL Server R Services.  In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the R language and then look at how to install and administer SQL Server R Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of R by showing you how to create and run simple R scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.  Finally, we'll go through some examples of how to use R to integrate data analytical methods in real-world situations, and wow your customers with the power of statistics!

## Title: Mobile, Paginated, KPIs and Power BI, Oh My! SSRS 2016 Reporting
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) 2016 is getting the biggest update since SQL Server 2005! This session will define and demo each of the SSRS report types are and how they are developed and supported: Mobile, Paginated, KPIs and Power BI. 
* Mobile - previously DataZen reports
* Paginated - SSRS RDL reports
* KPIs - new standalone Key Performance Indicators
* Power BI - now Power BI can be managed in SSRS for an on-premises solution
All of these report types can now be managed in SSRS for a single reporting solution.
We will also look at the new SSRS Web Portal (replacement for Report Manager) and how the development environment will change as well. Sometime will also be spent on how to support all of these report types and the impact it will have on IT.
If you have been curious about what has changed with SSRS in SQL Server 2016 and you want to be ahead of the curve, this is the session for you!

## Title: Does it Hurt When I Do This? Performing a SQL Server Health Check
 
**Abstract**:
How often do you review your SQL Servers for basic security, maintenance, and performance issues?  Many of the servers I "inherit" as a managed services provider have quite a few gaping holes. It is not unusual to find databases that are never backed up, servers with constant login failures (is it an attack or a bad connection string?), and servers that need more RAM/CPU/etc. (or sometimes that even have too much!) 

Come learn how to use freely available tools from multiple layers of the SQL Server stack to check your servers for basic issues like missing backups and CheckDB as well as for more advanced issues like page life expectancy problems and improper indexing. If you are responsible in any way for a Microsoft SQL Server (DBA, Windows Admin, even a Developer) you will see value in this session!

## Title: Troubleshooting Skills for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
Watching someone who is good at troubleshooting complex issues is like watching a magician perform on stage. It looks easy but unless you have the skills and know the trick, it can be black magic to you. Many DBAs and technology professionals can easily look in Books Online to find an answer to a technical question or how a SQL Server feature works. But where do you look on how you would become a better DBA at troubleshooting issues? How do you do you identify the root cause of the issue? This session will cover different approaches and skills to be a more efficient problem solver which is critical when your production system is down and time is money. The session will also cover how to create and present the root cause analysis so your team can learn from the mistakes and fix the issue.

## Title: Introduction to Microsoft Analytics – Turning Data into Intelligent Action
 
**Abstract**:
Data Science, Azure Machine Learning, and Analytics are all becoming core pieces to the success of every business.  As data professionals we need to know how these will affect what we do, and how we can use it to help our business and clients.  In this session we will take a look at these hot topics and learn how it helps us turn data into intelligence that will lead to actions that drive profits.  We will take a look at how Microsoft’s Cortana suite is the central hub for learning and implementing each of these core pieces.  An easy to follow example showing the flow from Data to Data Intelligence and thru to Action will be presented using Cortana Intelligence Suite.

## Title: Kerberos Delegation Made Simple
 
**Abstract**:
Kerberos delegation is often needed for SQL Server Reporting Services security. Many DBAs avoid Kerberos because of the complexity and come up with workarounds that may violate security policies in their shops. They also may not understand why Kerberos delegation is even required. 
Configuring Kerberos for SSRS can be broken down into three simple steps: SPN registration, setting delegation properties, and application configuration. It’s really not so difficult, and there are a number of tools that can help you troubleshoot when things don’t go as planned.
Attend this session to learn why Kerberos is necessary and how to configure and troubleshoot it.

## Title: SQL Server Databaseology: A Deep Dive Into Database Internals
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever taken apart a toaster or an alarm clock just to see how it worked? Ever wondered how that database actually functions at the record level, behind the scenes? SQL Server Databaseology is the study of SQL Server databases and their structures down to the very core of the records themselves. In this session, we will explore some of the deep inner workings of a SQL Server database at the record and page level.  You will walk away with a better understanding of how SQL Server stores data and that knowledge will allow you to build better, faster databases.

## Title: A New Approach to Unit and Integration Testing in SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
Testing is a critical part of the release process and vital to a high-quality data management lifecycle. Unfortunately, Integration Services (SSIS) does not have built-in support for testing and the tools for relational database testing are limited. As a result, most organizations forgo automated testing and focus entirely on manual user testing, which is both expensive and often occurs too late in the process to address all of the issues discovered. 

In this session, a new approach to unit testing (focusing on verifying the correctness of individual packages, tasks, or dataflows) and integration testing (focusing on validating that the data produced by an entire sequence of transformations) will be discussed. This development pattern uses metadata authored by analysts to automatically generate testing logic within the corresponding packages or to automatically generate standalone test packages that contain all of the necessary validation logic.

## Title: Revenge: The SQL!
 
**Abstract**:
Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.

## Title: Data Migration Using BIML
 
**Abstract**:
Many companies scale out their databases horizontally, partitioning data by customer (or some other identifier) into separate databases or instances.  Sometimes, it becomes important to move that data from one database to another.  SQL Server Integration Services is a fantastic tool for ETL, but creating and maintaining dozens or hundreds of data flows by hand is exhaustingly tedious.  Instead of doing it the hard way, use the BI Markup Language (BIML) to automate package development.  This talk will show how we can use metadata tables and BIML to auto-create SSIS packages to migrate data from one database to another, handling foreign key constraints along the way.

## Title: Pragmatic Power BI:  Transforming Data
 
**Abstract**:
Once we’ve extracted data from a source, we typically need to clean, or otherwise change, that data in preparation for loading it into Power BI.  In this session, BI Architect, SQL Server MVP and Analysis Services Maestro Bill Pearson will explore the options Power BI offers to unpivot, filter, sort, aggregate, and perform other needed operations to make these preparations.  We’ll employ a dataset containing issues that commonly present real-world challenges, and work through the steps we can take in Power BI to transform the data to a state that works within Power BI.  Moreover, we’ll define calculations, and get a glimpse of the M language that underlies transformational processes we construct.

## Title: Get Your Optimizer to Give up All Its Secrets
 
**Abstract**:
You know that execution plans can provide you with vital information to tune a query, but just how does that plan get generated?  In this session, we will examine details the query optimization process that are not very well known.  We will discuss how SQL Server parses a T-SQL statement then and begins applying rules to make it more efficient.  Did you know that SQL Server can be coaxed into outputting hidden structures such as parse trees and memos?  We'll do just that, and then take it a step further with a unique visualization tool that I have created.  With a better understanding of how SQL Server optimizes T-SQL (and sometimes doesn't do it as well as might be hoped), you can write more efficient SQL statements.

## Title: Introduction to BIML and BimlScript
 
**Abstract**:
You have a lot of data to move and a lot of pieces to manage. Perhaps you're a developer and know that SSIS is the best way to move it, but you naturally dislike GUI-based development or you're just not looking forward to the tedium.

Or perhaps you're a team lead/architect and are looking for an efficient platform that best utilizes the development skills of your team.

Jeremy Marx will introduce BIML, a language you can quickly pick up to develop SSIS solutions with code, and BIMLscript, intelligently mixing in C# to make your BIML practically build itself.

Jeremy will demonstrate how to build a simple, single-table SSIS package using BIML, then extend it to many tables with just a few lines of code, and finally apply a more robust data flow designed for reuse. You'll leave with tools and resources to begin coding SSIS solutions faster and more efficiently.

## Title: Biml: Your 3D Printer for SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
In this demo-heavy session, you will learn about the basic concepts of increasing productivity by creating your SSIS packages using Biml.

We will look into manual Biml code to understand the general idea of Biml, then take it from there and generate a whole staging area from scratch and end with a complete manageable solution to completely maintain your staging process using SQL tables.

Have you ever spent hours fixing your SSIS due to a schema change on the source? Ever wanted to add a "load timestamp" to 370 tables in your staging area but refrained because it would have taken you weeks to do so? If so, this is the session for you!

## Title: Incrementally Moving to the Cloud Using Biml
 
**Abstract**:
Many organizations are interested in the cost savings, ease of maintenance, and other benefits of hosting data solutions on Microsoft Azure.  For most, moving to the cloud is easier said than done, especially when they have a large existing solution that is being actively used by stakeholders.

In this session, we will examine various strategies for incrementally moving your solution to the cloud. This will include strategies that incorporate the use of:
1) New value-added features and services, such as machine learning and big data
2) Hybrid approaches where portions of your existing solutions can be moved to the cloud without requiring everything to be moved
3) Failover and surge approaches that enable the cloud to supplement on premises resources
4) and much more

Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) will be central to our approach, enabling the rapid movement of assets back and forth between on premises and cloud hosting.

All code will be shared with attendees.

**Abstract**:
Good managers believe lazy people don't accomplish much.  Great managers realize that a lot of lazy people get their work done, just more efficiently.  The right lazy person will find YOU a better way to accomplish the same amount.
In this session, I will show you several of the tips and tricks I have picked up and use to make my life easier.  From keyboard shortcuts to some lesser-known SSMS built-in tools, I hope to make your life easier, and make you a lazy DBA, too!

## Title: Test Automation: Agile Enablement for DW and BI Teams
 
**Abstract**:
Test automation is one of several key technical enablement practices that allows teams to be more successful in their agile journeys. While there are lots of test practices and automation tools out there for software development teams to leverage, very few are targeted to data-related development and testing. Agile analytics practitioner Lynn Winterboer and DW/BI architect and developer Cher Fox will share essential agile test foundations and data-focused test automation technologies to help data warehousing and business intelligence teams get a leg up on this important agile practice, including a demo of how this works!
