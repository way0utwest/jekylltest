##Title: Code Like a Snake Charmer - Intro to Python!##
 
**Abstract**:
Python is the one of the most popular programming languages used today and one of the most useful tools in the data scientist's tool belt especially for machine learning. Python is integrated into the Microsoft stack in tools like Azure ML and now SQL Server 2017.

The session will be an introduction to the Python language including: 

1.) Installing and Configuring Python
2.) Access and Manipulate Data
3.) Install and Manage Packages
4.) Create and Use Objects/Variables
5.) Control Flows and Functions
6.) Managing the Python installation in MSSQL

Attend this session to learn how to use Python to take your data analytics to the next level. We will use Python, SQL Server and the Anaconda distribution of Python to learn the basics of Python and how it is integrated in the Microsoft stack! We will walk through a simple deployment of a machine learning model to see how it all works together and learns some basic data science fundamentals.

##Title: Working with Temporal Data in SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
In many industries, it is necessary for data professionals to be able to show what a data set looked like at a previous point in time. Whether it's calculating tax or insurance rates based on a contract date, quickly comparing data changes over time for trend analysis or just recovering from an accidental data change, it's useful to be able to look back in time through our data. SQL Server has long offered solutions like Change Data Capture or trigger-based audit tables, though those aren’t always the best solutions for each situation. SQL Server 2016 introduces system-versioned tables, which track data through time with far less overhead than other solutions. In this session, you'll learn how to work with tables for each kind of solution, how SQL Server manages data within those tables, and how to query data at a specific point in time using several real-world examples. Attendees will leave with a fundamental understanding of practical use cases for different types of temporal tables.

##Title: Getting started with SQL Azure Database: What you need to know##
 
**Abstract**:
Azure SQL Database offers a way quickly spin up new databases with minimal management requirements. However, the number of differences between on-premises SQL Server and Azure SQL Database can be overwhelming. Even worse, with DBaaS it’s not clear who is responsible for what anymore.
In this session, we will cover all the basic steps of getting your first Azure SQL Database instance spun up. We’ll cover common gotchas, like firewall settings and resource locks. We’ll also dive into some more advanced options with templates, allowing you to make your processes reproducible.
By the end of this presentation, you’ll understand if Azure SQL Database is the right choice for you and your needs. You’ll understand how it can simplify management and allow you to scale easily. Finally, you’ll have the confidence to go and create your own instance with ease.

##Title: PowerShell for BI Professionals: Automating SSIS, SSRS  SSAS##
 
**Abstract**:
PowerShell has allowed DBAs to manage huge numbers of SQL servers, all automatically. Now BI practitioners can reap the same benefits of scale and automation.  Scenarios that are normally extremely time consuming can be done quickly, all with a few lines of PowerShell.  

This session will be filled with demos based on real-life scenarios and use-cases.  We will demonstrate how to scale and automate your BI solutions, with a minimum of effort.  In particular, we will be covering PowerShell cmdlets  their integrations with SSRS, SSIS,  SSAS.

By the end of the session, you'll be able to accomplish in minutes what would normally take hours or days.  You’ll know ways to quickly deploy hundreds of SSRS objects to multiple servers; or instantly identify and process stale SSAS dimensions.  Additionally, you will also be able to take care of some pesky ETL tasks, some by automating SSIS, and others using just plain old PowerShell.

##Title: Successfully Migrating Existing Databases to Azure SQL Database##
 
**Abstract**:
First impressions have long-lasting effects. When dealing with an architecture change like migrating to Azure SQL Database the last thing you want to do is leave a bad first impression by having an unsuccessful migration. In this session, you will learn why Azure SQL Database might be for you. Next, you will learn how to test migrations for compatibility issues before you start the migration process. You will learn how to successfully migrate your database schema and data. Finally, you will learn how to determine which performance tier is a good starting point for your existing workload and how to monitor your workload over time to make sure your users have a great experience while you save as much money as possible.

##Title: How to Implement a Hierarchy in SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
One of the most common structures you will come across in the real world is a hierarchy (either a single parent "tree" or a multi-parent "graph"). Many systems will implement the obvious examples, such as a corporate managerial structure or a bill of materials. It turns out that almost any many-to-many relationship can be used as a hierarchy to find the relationship of parent rows to child rows (for example, the relationship of actors to movies they’ve been in). In this session, we’ll discuss several different implementations of hierarchies that you can use to optimize your hierarchy implementations, including SQL Server 2017's graph tables, and put into practice immediately, with ready-made T-SQL examples.

##Title: ETL Architecture for Real-Time BI##
 
**Abstract**:
For decades batch processing has been the defacto standard for Extract Transform and Load.  For most of that time 24 hour data refresh cycles were accepted as part of Business Intelligence solutions and developer skill sets have long depended upon the reliable patterns of batch. In recent years, however, demands have begun to shift. New use cases in every industry are now causing leading edge BI solutions to demand much shorter time to realizing value. The old architecture, skills, and tools are proving insufficient to meet this demand. In this session we will look at the fundamentals of architecting real-time BI solutions, including the new categories of problems for which we will now have to solve.  Upon completing the session attendees will have a clear picture of the new skills and patterns that must be learned in order to excel in the next phase of Business Intelligence evolution.

##Title: DevOps for the DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps came out of the Agile movement and the idea that operations needed to be part of the solution for agile development to be successful.  The DBA was often the most resilient and robust member of the operations team and most resistant to change.  This mentality was essential to the protection of company’s critical production data.

This session discusses common database challenges and how they can be minimized or solved with newer DevOps practices without impacting the DBAs “safe zone”.  We’ll discuss how to use these vital skills and motivate everyone towards solutions for more success in agile development environments. Development, testing, provisioning, patching, upgrading and managing will become easier with agile tools, virtualization and collaboration.  
The take-aways from this session are to embrace DevOps basics with a “DBA twist” such as:
•	Develop, Rinse, Repeat
•	Test Until Your Five Year Old Can Do It
•	Human Intervention Creates Human Error- Automate EVERYTHING.

Hi, my name is Jason I'm a practice lead at Redapt. I spend most of my day helping clients solve business problems mostly in the Data and Advanced Analytics spaces. Sometimes this involves various and sundry cloud technologies including Azure Data Factory, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, Azure Data Lake Store, Azure Databricks, HDInsight and Azure SQL Database. I'm fluent in several languages including: SQL, C#, Python, and PowerShell.

I'm a Microsoft Certified Master of SQL Server (MCM) and have been recognized for my technical excellence and evangelism efforts by Microsoft by being awarded the Most Valuable Professional (MVP) for the last 5+ years.

In my off hours I like to snowboard, karaoke, ride roller coasters, and play arcade games
 
 
 
 
##Title: Why am I able to master several technology languages but I struggle in my own business language?##
 
**Abstract**:
Technology people are well known to be focused, results motivated, introvert, etc. 95% of your time is spent “communicating” successfully with computers: programming, building databases, analizing, etc. If something is wrong an alert window will pop up. The problem is that human interaction doesn’t have any warning sound to do it all over again or make some changes. Most of the time we only have one chance to do it right.
The struggles shows in a workplace filled with employees of different backgrounds or cultures, with different native languages that convey to speak English as the business language. Plus the fact that we don’t have the right skills to communicate appropriately. 
The problems will inevitably arise during human interaction; what we can do is try to minimize the frustration that it takes to communicate efficiently. In this session we will be able to learn that communication is not just a given fact, is something that needs to be learnt and taught.

##Title: End-to-End Troubleshooting Checklist for SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
Learning how to detect, diagnose and resolve performance problems in SQL Server is tough.  Often, years are spent learning how to use the tools and techniques that help you detect when a problem is occurring, diagnose the root-cause of the problem, and then resolve the problem.  

In this session, attendees will see demonstrations of the tools and techniques which make difficult troubleshooting scenarios much faster and easier, including:

• XEvents, Profiler/Traces, and PerfMon 
• Using Dynamic Management Views (DMVs)
• Advanced Diagnostics Using Wait Stats
• Reading SQL Server execution plan 

Every DBA needs to know how to keep their SQL Server in tip-top condition, and you’ll need skills the covered in this session to do it.

##Title: Python in SQL Server 2017##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2017 has finally arrived, bringing with it a host of exciting new features.  Of particular interest to BI practitioners and data scientists is the integration of the Python programming language into the SQL ecosystem.  This integration opens up a number of possibilities for in-database analytics and intelligent database applications, so let's get started!

In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the Python language and then look at how to install and administer Machine Learning Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of Python by showing you how to create and run simple scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.  Finally, we'll go through some examples of how to use Python to integrate data analytical methods in real-world situations, and wow your customers with the power of analytics!

##Title: Automate your SQL Server installs and configurations using Powershell Desired State Configuration##
 
**Abstract**:
Database administrators are being tasked with managing a large number of SQL Server instances.  These instances can be built on premise, virtualized, physical, or in the cloud.  With Powershell Desired State Configuration, DBAs can not only automate the installation of SQL Server, but also any specific configurations needing to be applied to each new instance.  Powershell DSC provides a repeatable process to ensure all builds are done in the exact same way.  We'll cover what is Powershell Desired State Configuration and how a DBA can take advantage of it.  Next, we'll dive straight into a demo of the installation and configuration of two SQL Server instances from scratch.  

Some powershell experience is recommended.

##Title: Reducing The Surface Area Of Risk in Data Security##
 
**Abstract**:
Data obfuscation, also known as data masking, is soon a new legal requirement. Masking is the solution for non-production systems (i.e. DEV, TEST, etc) to greatly reduce the surface area of risk for data breach in your organization.  Masking should not be confused with encryption, which is an appropriate solution for production applications.  Those who believe that encryption solves all security problems are misled.

When done properly, masked data is not noticeable unless you look closely. Masking data well might still be usable for analytic reporting and aggregation, yet utterly useless for revealing confidential data. Masking is important enough that sophisticated software packages have become available.

Come learn about the right way to mask non-production data in order to allow the organization to limit possible exposure only to production.  Learn what techniques can be used, why, and what factors should be considered when deciding to secure confidential data.

##Title: SQL Server Take Over:  Establishing a Baseline##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Take Over:  Establishing a Baseline

Performance assessment and tuning for the beginner DBA
 
Have you ever inherited a group of servers with not a lot of documentation to accompany them?   Do you have a lot of undocumented or new servers in your environment and you want to establish some baseline configuration setting prior to making changes? You need up to date information on the system very quickly. 
 
The server is running slowly... or is it? Slow compared to what?  Before you being digging into performance issues, there are some baseline metrics you should have established. Only after the information has been gathered, can a plan of attack be developed to help resolve issues with performance. Attendees in this session will learn how to quickly  gather information, review the results and get an action plan on the next step in performance tuning.

##Title: How to Build Your Disaster Recovery Plan##
 
**Abstract**:
So your boss asked for a copy of your DR plan.  Once you've wiped that deer-in-the-headlights look off your face, you realize "We've got database backups," isn't exactly a plan.  You need to come up with a plan to recover your business when disaster strikes. This session will help you build this plan by defining what a disaster could be, documenting the business impact, and identifying your limitations.  We will show how to use this information to establish metrics (such as RTO and RPO), document current recovery configurations, and design an effective recovery strategy that meets the needs and budget of your business. Attending this session will give you the knowledge and tools to create an effective disaster recovery plan that will make your boss happy and ensure the continuity of your business.

##Title: Minimizing User Impact with Advanced Restore Methods##
 
**Abstract**:
We all know that backups are only half the battle - restores are what really matter when disaster strikes. Standard restores, while effective, may require additional downtime and further affect the business. This session will demonstrate three advanced restore methods you should know: point-in-time restores, piecemeal restores, and page restores, and will discuss when each method is appropriate. Attend this session to learn how to be a better DBA by minimizing downtime and user impact after disaster has struck!

I have worked with SQL Server since the mid 90's starting with SQL Server 4.21 running under OS/2. I have worked as a developer, designer, and DBA for a variety of organizations, ranging from trading firms, real estate services companies a water testing lab as well as software companies.

As part of my past, I spent 8 years working on systems that were either designed from the ground up to be installed as third-party applications or designed as internal products that were later bundled and sold as applications to customers.

I also spent some time in .com land and though I did not end up a millionaire I did end up with some great stories.

##Title: Tame Your Unruly Data With Constraints##
 
**Abstract**:
Bad data comes in many forms: duplicate rows, wrong data type, invalid values, and orphaned or missing foreign keys. Time is wasted cleansing, reviewing and correcting data, not to mention the potential hazards bad data can cause. This introductory presentation will explain the data types and constraints available in SQL Server, and how they can replace or augment business rules that would otherwise be written in application or procedure code. Performance benefits provided by constraints will be demonstrated. We will examine the various system views and procedures that describe constraints and how to use them to document your databases. You will be able to apply this knowledge to your database environments and see significant improvements in data quality, performance, and reliability.

##Title: Biml for Beginners: Speed Up Your SSIS Development##
 
**Abstract**:
Are you tired of creating and updating the same SSIS packages again and again? Is your wrist hurting from all that clicking, dragging, dropping, connecting and aligning? Do you want to take the next step and really speed up your SSIS development?

Say goodbye to repetitive work and hello to Biml, the markup language for Business Intelligence projects.

In this session we will look at the basics of Biml. First learn how to use Biml to generate SSIS packages from database metadata. Then see how you can reuse code to implement changes in multiple SSIS packages and projects with just a few clicks. Finally, we will create an example project that you can download and start with to speed up your SSIS development from day one.

Stop wasting your valuable time on doing the same things over and over and over again, and see how you can complete in a day what once took more than a week!

##Title: Why Third Party Vendors Do The Things They Do##
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever installed a third-party application that uses SQL Server, started to use it, and then wondered why does this feature behave this way or what the heck were they thinking when they did it this way.

I at one point was one of those people who designed, developed, and maintained databases for an ISV.  This is my chance to explain and atone for my database sins and explain why some decisions seem like good ideas at the time and why some are forced upon an ISV.

This presentation has three main objectives:
 1) Explain why vendors make the design, coding, and implementation decisions that they do; 
2) Discuss how to make third-party applications run better in your environment; 
3) Teach you how to work around those limitations and work with those vendors and get better support.

##Title: What could be better than football and R!##
 
**Abstract**:
R -- it's included in SQL Server 2016. What can I do with it? Why do I need to know yet another software language? How can I use it to figure out important things -- like who is the best qb in the league right now, statistically?

We'll go over the basics of R and how to do things with it, plus items such as:

- Installing and managing packages
- Accessing data in various formats
- Basic data visualization functions

##Title: AI to the Masses! But How? Pixie Dust?##
 
**Abstract**:
The way you hear about artificial intelligence, it seems like you throw some big data in the cloud and wave a magical AI wand over it and you can predict the future…right?  Not exactly.  Azure does have some great options to bring data science to your data but you need to weigh the options.  In this session we'll discuss those options and some questions to answer if you're being tasked with making magical things happen with your data.

I'm a Microsoft Certified Master of SQL Server (MCM) and have been recognized for my technical excellence and evangelism efforts by Microsoft by being awarded the Most Valuable Professional (MVP) for the last 5+ years.

In my off hours I like to snowboard, karaoke, ride roller coasters, and play arcade games
 
 
 
 
##Title: Data Cleansing With SQL And R##
 
**Abstract**:
On a given project, data scientists can spend upwards of 80% of their time preparing, cleaning, and correcting data. In this session, we will look at different data cleansing and preparation techniques using both SQL Server and R. We will investigate the concept of tidy data and see how we can use tools in both languages to simplify research and analysis of a small but realistic data set.

##Title: Azure SQL DW Performance Common Issues##
 
**Abstract**:
Azure SQL Data Warehouse and APS are based on the MPP architecture. Analyzing the workload can be very different than SQL Server and SQL DB. In this session, we will show you what an MPP execution plan is, what to look for, and how to compare them to DMV output to pinpoint performance problems. We will use real customer scenarios to show you the most common causes of slowness and how we improved the performance. Please note: This session is intended for individuals with a 200 level understanding of MPP architecture with some understanding of data movement. There will be a short review of core components, but the discussion will quickly move to more advanced topics.

##Title: Twitter Data  Sentiment Analysis: Staring Logic Apps, Azure ML, Twitter Data, Power BI, and Python##
 
**Abstract**:
Six months ago we went to Spider-man: Homecoming.  On the way home I thought “I wonder what the rest of the world thinks of this movie?  I wonder what people on Twitter are saying?  I wonder if this is that tied to box office performance?”  Over the last six months we’ve been building data sets on movies and collecting sentiment analysis of Twitter data.  This lead to a journey of data discovery.  First to figure out how to capture and analyze social media data from Twitter.  Next we needed box office information.  After that we wanted to capture sentiment.  Then we wanted stock market data.  Then we wanted movie information, runtime, rating, Metacritic score, IMDB score, and then how do we get historical data if we want to increase our data set?  Once you collect the data how do you store it?  How do you display it?  All this and more….. but probably just this….because that’s a lot.

##Title: Optimizing SQL Server Instances You Don't Control##
 
**Abstract**:
When you’re responsible for the care and feeding of packaged business apps and the underlying database is struggling to keep up, it can be quite challenging if not impossible to make code adjustments or configuration changes that improve responsiveness.
Learn what could well be the root cause for the problems you are experiencing, ways to identify it and simple solutions you can implement without anyone else’s help.

##Title: Reading Execution Plans Successfully##
 
**Abstract**:
If you've seen an execution plan but didn't know how to read it, this session is for you.

The goal of this session to learn how SQL Server is interpreting your query into an execution plan. We'll discuss execution plan internals, how SQL Server estimates the cost of your query, and what a graphical execution plan is displaying through its operators.

Learning to read an execution plan is a great way to begin troubleshooting performance. At the end, we will take a look at how SQL Server 2016 provides more tools for exploring execution plans.

As part of my past, I spent 8 years working on systems that were either designed from the ground up to be installed as third-party applications or designed as internal products that were later bundled and sold as applications to customers.

I also spent some time in .com land and though I did not end up a millionaire I did end up with some great stories.

##Title: SaaS/IaaS Compromise - Learning Azure SQL Database Managed Instance##
 
**Abstract**:
Azure SQL Database Managed Instance offers you the best of both worlds: deeper access to the underlying virtual database server (infrastructure-as-a-service, or IaaS), with the high agility of software-as-a-service (SaaS). In this session you'll learn the Managed Instance use case and be equipped to make an informed decision on how you host your SQL Server databases in the Microsoft Azure public cloud.

##Title: Only You Can Prevent Database Fires!##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you find yourself constantly putting out "fires"? Can't take anymore heat in the data center? We as DBAs can easily become burnt out with dealing with these daily blazes. Wouldn’t it be grand to learn how to prevent these fires from scorching us to begin with? In this session, we will jump into things you can start implementing as "fire prevention" to stop the "fire fighting".  We will talk about several things that you can take back to your shop and put into action easily ranging from code tuning, backup maintenance, monitoring and performance tuning!

##Title: Using Your On-prem Data in a Cloud World##
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft Power BI, Flow, and PowerApps are powerful cloud tools that can take your on-premises data to new heights. Using your data where it is now gives you the ability to invest in improving processes, instead of focusing on a data migration strategy.

In this session, we will discover the benefits of using the cloud tools, how those benefits translate to being on-prem, and how we can use the data in Office 365 as well. We will setup a data gateway, connect to on-prem data sources, and use that data in Office 365 and SharePoint Server 2016.

##Title: Ethics, Morals, and Laws for the DBA 101##
 
**Abstract**:
Ethics, Morals, and Laws each govern one aspect of our behavior as people and DBAs. They govern which actions we take and which actions we avoid.

Understanding the basics of these guides and how they coordinate (and sometimes conflict) with each other helps you to make choices you can live with from both a personal and professional perspective.

This session presents basic definitions, ideas, and discussion points. It is intended to be an interactive presentation where the audience contributes to the discussion, so no two presentations are exactly the same!

##Title: Why NULL is not a value (and other SQL gotchas)##

Allowing NULL "values" in your database is simple, but managing them is a whole different story. Learn what NULL really means and why you may want to avoid it in your systems. I will share techniques for overcoming NULL and other SQL idiosyncrasies leading to bad data or incorrect query results.

##Title: ARMed for Azure##
 
**Abstract**:
The Azure Resource Model (ARM) enables Azure infrastructure automation for both IaaS and PaaS deployments.  Using Visual Studio as a management tool enables repeatable, automated, source controlled deployments for test and development environments, enabling true DevOps practices for all aspects of pre-production systems.  In this session, I will demonstrate, explain, and deploy a IaaS/PaaS hybrid environment (SQL and BI stack elements) using ARM templates, Visual Studio, source control integration, and PowerShell scripts.

##Title: Everyone Has a Story to Tell: Developing Your First Presentation##
 
**Abstract**:
Ever considered giving a presentation of your own? Pondered how your favorite speakers got their start? Contemplated whether you could ever do that too, but were not sure where to begin?

Well I say you can and will show you how to get started! In this session, I will teach you how to develop your idea and create session content, and share tips  tricks that I have learned along the way. 

You will leave armed with a wealth of resources (and hopefully some inspiration) to venture forth and develop your first presentation.

##Title: Where Should My Data Live (and Why)?##
 
**Abstract**:
Long gone are the days where the only architecture decision you had to make when scaling an environment was deciding which part of the datacenter would store your new server. There is a dizzying array of options available in the SQL Server and Azure ecosystems and those are evolving by the day. Is “the cloud” a fad? Are private datacenters a thing of the past? Could both questions have a kernel of truth in them? In this session I will go over real world scenarios and walk you through real world solutions that utilize your datacenter, cloud providers, and everything in between to keep your data highly available and your customers happy.

##Title: Parameter Sniffing the Good, the Bad and the Ugly##
 
**Abstract**:
Parameter sniffing is something that more than often helps performance on your servers; however, there are times when it can hinder performance as well. In this session we will define exactly what parameter sniffing is, and examine when it is good and when it is bad. Lastly, we will explore the different options available to fix bad parameter sniffing. After this session, you will be able to locate and fix bad parameter sniffing when it occurs on your servers.

As part of my past, I spent 8 years working on systems that were either designed from the ground up to be installed as third-party applications or designed as internal products that were later bundled and sold as applications to customers.

I also spent some time in .com land and though I did not end up a millionaire I did end up with some great stories.

##Title: Making Your List and Checking It Twice: Introduction to unit testing with tSQLt##
 
**Abstract**:
Unit testing allows database code to be consistently tested during the development process, but it can be challenging to get unit testing setup for database development. This session will give an overview on the purpose of unit testing, the installation of the tSQLt framework, and the design of unit tests. I will use general concepts of test driven design to create and run unit tests to confirm that objects exist and to test single and multiple test cases. Learn how to implement unit testing in a development environment and create and run your own units tests.

##Title: Networking Internals for the SQL Server Professional##
 
**Abstract**:
Once data leaves your SQL Server do you know what happens or is the world of networking a black box to you? Would you like to know how data is packaged up and transmitted to other systems and what to do when things go wrong?  Are  you tired of being frustrated with the network team? In this session we introduce how data moves between systems on networks and TCP/IP internals. We’ll discuss real world scenarios showing you how your network’s performance impacts the performance of your SQL Server and even your recovery objectives.

##Title: SQL Sprawl - How to get a handle on your Infrastructure##
 
**Abstract**:
This Session will give you the tools to assess your existing SQL Deployments, physical or virtual.  
Determine what’s being installed without (or without) your knowledge.  
How are they being utilized resource wise and how are they licensed.
Then determine what can be combined, right sized or retired and does your existing licensing make sense.
This will provide a road-map to make a case for virtualization (if you’re not there yet) or just to get a handle on your SQL Sprawl.

##Title: SQL Server Encryption##
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever wanted to know how Transparent Database Encryption (TDE) works or how you set it up? What about encrypting your backups? This session will go over all the steps and caveats that go with this technology. TDE allows you to have your database encrypted on disk and the same Encryption Hierarchy allows you to back up your database and have it encrypt the contents in the backup file.  We will discuss the Encryption Hierarchy which is used for encryption in SQL Server and take you through keeping your secrets safe. We will also go over how Always Encrypted works as well. Master the concepts of SQL Server Encryption when you are done with this session.
