## Title: SQL Server 2016: Maturazione dell'In-Memory OLTP
 
**Abstract**:
In-Memory OLTP #232; una tecnologia che ha subito in questa nuova versione significativi miglioramenti, tesi soprattutto a garantire la scalabilit#224; su databases di maggiori dimensioni e un throughput pi#249; elevato, al fine di supportare carichi di lavoro sempre pi#249; elevati. Sono stati inoltre eliminati vincoli e limitazioni relative a tabelle e stored procedures per rendere pi#249; agevole la migrazione alla nuova piattaforma e trarne i relativi vantaggi. In questa sessione esploreremo le nuove features e quelle migliorate (altering Memory-optimized Tables and Natively Compiled Stored Procedures, Scalar UDF, supporto alle subqueries nelle Natively Complied Stored Procedures ecc.).

## Title: Choosing the right Mobile BI tool: SSRS vs Power BI vs Datazen
 
**Abstract**:
Two almost contemporary events have recently marked the Microsoft's BI offer: the release of Power BI under GA license and the acquisition of Datazen.
Join these new products with the long-lasting Reporting Services (SSRS), means that now developers have a wide range of tools available for reporting, dashboarding, data analysis, both for desktop and mobile devices. So the question is: which one to choose? What are the key factor for supporting the correct decision?
This session we'll focus on Mobile BI reporting; we will provide a clear and understandable overview of each product, highlighting strengths and weaknesses. 
You'll be able to see how it can be done Mobile BI with Reporting Services, even tough it isn't a immediate feature, as is for Power BI and Datazen. 
Based on some real examples we will set out a comparison matrix to find the best way to meet your needs with the right reporting tool.

## Title: SSRS - Charts like you've never seen before
 
**Abstract**:
Reporting Services offre la possibilit#224; di illustrare dati in maniera visuale attraverso pi#249; di 50 grafici, che coprono la maggior parte dei Business Requirements di uno sviluppatore. Tuttavia, la richiesta di report sempre pi#249; intuitivi e graficamente innovativi ha creato l'esigenza di reportistiche pi#249; strutturate con grafici sempre pi#249; particolari .

In questa sessione verranno presentate prima delle linee guida generali per creare dei grafici classici pi#249; accattivanti e in linea con le nuove dinamiche del mercato BI; in secondo luogo verranno realizzati dei veri e propri grafici non nativi ma rimanendo sempre all'interno di Reporting Services.

## Title: SQL Server 2016 Query Store: un nuovo modo di ottimizzare le query
 
**Abstract**:
Query Store #232; la nuova funzionalit#224; di SQLServer 2016 che permette la storicizzazione nel tempo delle prestazioni delle query, oltre i riavvii della macchina.  Consente l'archiviazione delle prestazioni  del piano di esecuzione e di ogni singola esecuzione delle query, permettendone l'analisi a posteriori.
Questo meccanismo permette di effettuare analisi sofisticate delle query e delle loro prestazioni. E’ possibile correlare il cambiamento delle performances a quello del piano di esecuzione o ad altri eventi, seguire nel tempo le prestazioni di determinate porzioni del codice, individuare regressioni oppure identificare le query che hanno degradato nelle ultime esecuzioni.
E possibile inoltre seguire nel tempo l’evoluzione di un piano di esecuzione in funzione di cambiamenti, quali cambio delle statistiche, modifiche dello schema o presenza di indici.
La sessione entra nel dettaglio della funzionalit#224; e ne illustra l’utilizzo in un’ottica di ottimizzazione e troubleshooting.

## Title: The most prominent wait types of your SQL Server 2016 (IT)
 
**Abstract**:
Una query, durante la sua esecuzione, pu#242; essere sospesa decine o addirittura centinaia di volte. Una query rimane in esecuzione fino a quando, ad esempio, non richiede di accedere ad una risorsa esterna o fino a quando il thread che la gestisce non eccede il quantum di utilizzo della CPU. In SQL Server 2016 ci sono 815 buoni motivi per cui una query pu#242; attendere. In questa sessione, sulla base delle statistiche pubblicate dalla DMV sys.dm_os_wait_stats, verranno descritti e analizzati i wait type pi#249; frequenti in un carico di lavoro OLTP.
