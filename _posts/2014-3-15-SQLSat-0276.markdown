## Title: Decouple Database Performance from Database Capacity
 
**Abstract**:
Virtualizing SQL Server has many benefits, but performance isn't one of them.  Typically, I/O bottlenecks (due to storage) in a virtualized environment lead to poor and unpredictable database performance.  Throwing money at the problem by purchasing more storage hardware is often expensive, disruptive and doesn't quite solve the problem.A better way is to accelerate virtualized SQL Servers by reducing I/O latency with Flash Hypervisor software.In this session, we will discuss:.       Leveraging the virtualization platform to reduce costs and complexity of SQL Server deployments.       The performance challenges of virtualizing SQL Server.       Using Flash Hypervisor software to accelerate I/O and create high-performance SQL Servers.       Real-world results – faster queries, more transactions and shorter processing times

## Title: Peace of Mind: Making DBCC CHECKDB Go Faster
 
**Abstract**:
Along with backups, consistency checks are arguably the two most important tasks that DBAs need to perform regularly. Our databases are getting bigger every day, and CHECKDB run times, along with its performance impact to Production systems, keep increasing. In this session we discuss how to improve your system so that you can reduce the time that it takes to run CHECKDB or the individual DBCC CHECK* commands. We will cover topics like Transaction log and VLF management, tempdb configuration, trace flags, Resource Governor, and many more. In one of many the demos we will explore a real life example where SurveyMonkey's consistency checks were taken from 7 days down to 6 hours.

## Title: Faster Insights From Any Data
 
**Abstract**:
Today’s organizations face growing challenges extracting business value from their data. The need for rapid insight is made more challenging by the expanding volume, complexity, and velocity of data. Traditional approaches to information management fail to harness this “data deluge”. New paradigms for data management and data analytics are emerging. Transformation of data to business insight requires a holistic approach that aligns the right platforms, technologies, and processes to support the decision process and analysis that business demands. During the session, we will the examine the Microsoft’s vision of enabling organizations to manage any data at any scale while empowering business users through self-serve information management and self-serve business intelligence. Through demos and interactive discovery we  will explore how the PowerBI BI tools can be used with Hadoop /HDInsight to accelerate organizations’ journey from data to insight.

## Title: Database Development with SQL Server Data Tools
 
**Abstract**:
With the release of SQL Server 2012, the new SQL Server Data Tools serves as your primary development environment for building applications on top of SQL Server. SSDT plugs in to Visual Studio with tooling designed specifically for the application developer. With SSDT, developers no long need to constantly switch between VS and SSMS. In this session, Lenni demonstrates how SSDT is used to develop for (and deploy to) on-premise and Windows Azure SQL Database. You will learn how to use code navigation, IntelliSense, and refactoring with your database model, and how to design databases offline and under source control right from VS. Don’t miss out on this demo-centric information-packed session on the new generation of database tools for developers!

## Title: Best Practices for Efficient SSRS Report Creation
 
**Abstract**:
You always have more report requests than you can possibly fulfill. Wouldn't it be great if you could speed up the generation of reports? Templates can streamline the life cycle of a report for the whole team. In this session, you'll learn how templates in your tool belt can help you efficiently gather requirements, quickly design mock-ups, and standardize the look and feel of your SSRS reports. 
Reports don't stop changing once they're released into production, and some reports are phased out over time. Wouldn't it be great to have a way to keep track of the changes a report takes on in production over time? We'll talk about how to keep track of change requests, how to analyze the utilization of existing reports, and how to track changes in users for the reports in production.

## Title: An Analytics Sandbox in A World of Big Data  
 
**Abstract**:
As Big Data becomes the norm to deal with data volume, variety and velocity, it becomes increasingly harder for the Data Analyst to understand and work with data sets.  To overcome this we introduce Platfora, a Hadoop-backed data analysis framework which nicely complements more traditional data warehousing and BI solutions. We'll go over ingestion of new data and building of data sets and visualizations in a system that requires no more work than interacting with a graphical interface. More specifically, we will do so in the context of peer-to-peer lending, to show how insights on loan applicants and their risk profiles can be quickly revealed with no ETL development or demanding data transformation.

## Title: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Automating your BI Framework
 
**Abstract**:
Quite frankly, some aspects of building out a business intelligence solution are tedious. As you cycle through iterations of your star schema, you’ll find that even a simple data type change in the data warehouse requires you to make corresponding changes to staging tables, SSIS packages, and SSAS multidimensional or tabular models that take a considerable amount of time to implement. But there’s a better, faster way!In this session, we’ll explore lessons from a project that required implementation of a framework to easily generate BI objects based on reusable patterns. We’ll walk through the decision points in the framework design, review the implementation steps, and see demonstrations of how easily you can make iterative changes to your BI solution’s design by using reusable design patterns. Whether you simply want to accelerate change management or reproduce objects in bulk on demand, this session will give you practical tips for automating these processes.

## Title: Edge Case Testing for the Database Professional
 
**Abstract**:
Are you confident that your application performs as expected on Leap Day?  Do you know how long it would take to run out of identity values in your major tables?  Can you support case-sensitive collations and non-standard sort orders?  If not, odds are good that you are not edge and corner testing your application.  In this session, learn how to define the edges of your application and start to stretch those boundaries by setting up challenging test and development environments.  For database administrators, learn what configurations in your environment may be a source of bugs in application code and what you can do about it.  Learn about edge cases that you can start hardening your code against on Monday morning!

## Title: Monitoring Databases in a Virtual Environment
 
**Abstract**:
When moving databases to a virtual environment the performance metrics DBAs typically use to troubleshoot performance issues such as O/S metrics, storage configurations, CPU allocation and more become unreliable. DBAs no longer have a clear, reliable view of the factors impacting database performance. Understanding the difference between the physical and virtual server environment adds a new dimension to the DBA tasks. This presentation describes the changes that DBAs need to make in their performance and monitoring practices.

## Title: The Last NULL in the Coffin: Missing Data, SQL  the Relational Model
 
**Abstract**:
Missing data has possibly been the thorniest aspect of database management: without a logically sound yet practical solution, data professionals and users are left between a rock and a hard place. They must either (a) rely on SQL's arbitrary and flawed implementations of three-valued logic (3VL) based on NULLs and risk results that are easy to misinterpret, or wrong in ways hard to discern, or (b) undertake in applications a prohibitively complex, error prone and unreliable burden that belongs in the DBMS.
This presentation outlines a relational (2VL) solution to missing data that is devoid of NULLs and theoretically correct.
