## Title: Biml for Beginners: Generating SSIS packages with BimlScript
 
**Abstract**:
SSIS is a powerful tool for extracting, transforming and loading data, but creating the actual SSIS packages can be both tedious and time-consuming. Even if you use templates and follow best practices you often have to repeat the same steps over and over again. There are no easy ways to handle metadata and schema changes, and if there are new requirements you might have to go through all the packages one more time. It's time to bring the Don't Repeat Yourself principle to SSIS development. 

In this session I will use the free BIDS Helper add-in to show you the basics of Biml and BimlScript, how to generate SSIS packages automatically from databases, how easy those packages can be changed, and how to move common code to separate files that can be included where needed. See why they say Biml allows you to complete in a day what once took more than a week! 

This session is intended for SSIS developers who are not yet familiar with Biml.

## Title: Analytics and the DBA – Using BI Power tools to visualize your SQL Infrastructure
 
**Abstract**:
DBAs do not always have time to work with some of the amazing visual data tools that are becoming common place now for analysts.  In this presentation I will show how in just a few very easy steps you can learn more than the basics of PowerView, PowerPivot and Data Mining using data you are already familiar with as a DBA, your SQL Server installation data. We will look at new and interesting way to load, transform, merge and analyze configuration and performance data for many servers simultaneously. I will also demonstrate how to best utilize that data for reports in Excel, SSRS and Visio to get the most out of automation, standardization and visualization with the new Power tools.

## Title: When good SQL design goes bad
 
**Abstract**:
Take what you’ve learned about SQL Server and turn it upside down. 

 In this humorous session I’ll be debating many of the so called "best practices" in SQL Server and demonstrating counter arguments. Come along to see how so called "pillars" of design are starting to break down. 
•When you should NOT use stored procedures.
•When we don’t need indexes.
•When Clustered Tables are bad.
•When Identity Columns should not be Primary Keys.
•When we don’t care about fragmentation.
•When good naming convention’s go bad.
•Why Partitioning often makes your queries slower.
•Why do ORMs really makes sense when they make all your parameters nvarchar (max)

 Health Warning: These may not be the design tips you should be using on your production OLTP.

## Title: Life saver - Resource Governor for applications  reporting
 
**Abstract**:
This critical situation still exists in many live production environments in various organizations. This quick Life Saver techniques will quickly enable you to provide prompt solution as a patch with Resource Governor features. This helps to manage memory, cpu resources and enables various applications  reporting to perform better by creating resource pools and allocating the memory for various groups, users, databases, applications. Also this session answers below questions.

What does Resource Governor do? What is a resource Pool? Why any basic/intermediate users are given caution before implementing Resource Governor? What is this capable of doing in terms of allocating resources to the users, databases and applications? What are the methods to implement Resource Governor  how to monitor the resource pools in terms of GUI  T-SQL?

You can take away working scripts, functions, tools to make a Resource Governor work and manage them.

## Title: A Toolkit for Off-loading Data from Production
 
**Abstract**:
So, you have a problem with too much old data in your production database, right? Also, because production is the only place where your data currently is available, almost everyone has an account with permissions in that same database?
SQL Server comes with many tools that, when properly used, can make your life a whole lot more easy; some of which are: SQLCMD scripting, the Change Tracking system, Transactional Replication and the MERGE command.
In this session you will be presented to a simple toolkit that will utilize these tools to set up synchronization of your production data to an offline database in a way that is easy to configure and manage. The toolkit contains a very small number of T-SQL and SQLCMD scripts together with a “How to” instruction. Best of all – it#180;s available in Standard edition!

## Title: SQL Automation, how to build a highly automated SQL Server environment
 
**Abstract**:
Managing thousands of databases, providing 24/7 around the world covering a multitude of clients with different needs would be very time consuming. That is, if you have not highly automated things and taken operational management to the next level. In this session, you will take the first steps to become an automation engineer yourself by the creator of an entire management platform for SQL Server. You will learn the requirements by which the automation services was built, how it operates and how you can contribute. So as a DBA the time has come, not to perish but to prosper into the next digital revolution.

## Title: How to kill SQL server performance
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a high performance relational data platform suitable for storing lots of data for mission critical applications and everyone can use. Well thats what many seems to think. By looking at how SQL server is used I have seen many different ways of killing the SQL Server Performance. 
This session is about how you can kill the SQL server Performance so that you can justify the budget for your new cool hardware, or to find out what is wrong with your SQL Server so you don't need to buy new expensive hardware and make you the hero of the day.
During the session we will look at some  common performance issues, tools to investigate whats the problem and how to solve it. 
Prepare for few Power Point slides and lots of code samples.

## Title: SQL Server Magic Buttons: What are Trace Flags, and why should I care?
 
**Abstract**:
You have probably heard about SQL Server Trace Flags, but there are so many of them! Do you really need them? Is it safe to use them? What are they for? Is it worth spending time researching them and documenting them online? That's what I did anyway.

In this session you will get a good overview of what Trace Flags can do for you, the risks and benefits, and how you should approach bringing them in to your production environment. Then of course there will be a deep dive in to some of the most useful and interesting ones. Since there is a lot more information to this subject than can be covered in one hour, there will be an extensive list of online resources included.

## Title: Revenge: The SQL! - Director's Cut
 
**Abstract**:
Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.

## Title: Many to Many in SSAS: How To Implement It
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have many to many relationship between your dimensions? For example, a person having many accounts at the same bank and accounts being held by more than one person? Or do you have one to many, a patient having mutliple diagnosis? How do you analyze this data? Many to many in SSAS can help you.

In this session, you will learn step by step on how to implement many to many in SSAS. In addition, you will learn the benefits of using many to many, plus some real life examples of the implementation.

After this session, you will have better understanding of many to many in SSAS, plus you will be able to solve some of common business problems that arise daily.

## Title: SQL Server Foreign Keys – De-mystifying the Rest of the Story
 
**Abstract**:
Foreign Keys have a bad rap – they cause performance issues, they inhibit some inserts, deletes and updates, etc.  This may be true, but let’s further explore why we even have them and how they can benefit and maybe even improve performance.  This session will concentrate on many demos including the attributes associated with foreign keys.  The attendee will walk away from this session with a better understanding of Foreign Key utility and their maintenance.

## Title: Eight hours of work in 20 minutes
 
**Abstract**:
A case study of how a monthly data load has evolved, from just loading data into a table, through some indexes being disabled before loading and enabled after data is loaded, to partitioning the table and loading into a staging table. The last Changes to the solution has taken loading time from eight hours down to 20 minutes, saving a whole day of work for the staff checking and refining the data.
The presentation also includes some reflections on how partitioning the table has changed how both T-SQL and Entity Framework code is being written, to take advantage of partition elimination.
