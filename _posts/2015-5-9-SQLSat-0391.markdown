##Title: Turbocharge Your Career With a Learning Plan##
 
**Abstract**:
What will you learn next quarter and why? How will you learn it? How much time and money will it cost? What is the ROI on learning those skills? Those are the questions that you answer by building a learning plan and, if you do it well, you’ll find yourself steadily pulling away from your peers. It starts with a learning list, a place to capture skills you think you need to learn. That’s where you score each topic by estimating the effort to learn it in time and money and the value it adds to your career now and later. It’s absolutely an analog process, but it gives you the framework for answering one question: what do I learn next and why?

Once you’ve picked a topic, how do you learn more about it? Do you read blogs, buy books, or attend a class? Or all of the above? How much time makes sense? Join this session and learn how to dig into the topic to answer the questions that lead to a learning plan. After that, it’s just a matter of executing the plan!

##Title: Using mindmaps - Lightweight documentation for testing##
 
**Abstract**:
Quality starts with requirements. In small to mid-size companies, it is not uncommon for the communication chain to be broken. Florin Ursu shares ways to avoid miscommunication through a streamlined process in which requirements are communicated to both developers and testers simultaneously; then developers write code while testers document what will be tested. Florin explores what mindmaps are; what they can be used for, both in general and applied to software development; and then dives deeper into how mindmaps can be used for testing. He describes how his teams use mindmaps to brainstorm, organize testing scenarios, prioritize work, review test scenarios, present results to stakeholders highlighting what was tested and (just as important) what was not tested, issues found, and risks. Using example mindmaps, Florin highlights important details captured in day to day work, including tips regarding format, communication style, and how to “sell” the idea of mindmaps to your stakeholders

##Title: Continuous Delivery for Data Warehouses and Marts##
 
**Abstract**:
Continuous delivery is an approach that enables new functionality to be delivered as needed. This session will cover how this approach can be applied to data warehouses to enable faster time to value for the consumers of the data.
Most data warehouses are in a constant state of flux. There are new requirements coming in from the business, updates and improvements to be made to existing data and structures, and new initiatives that drive new data requirements. How do you manage the complexity of keeping up with the changes and delivering new features to your business users in a timely manner, while maintaining high quality? Continuous delivery is an approach for managing this. It focuses on automation of many steps in the process, so that time is spent on adding new functionality, rather than repetitive steps. Attend this session and learn how Continuous Delivery can be applied to your data projects.

##Title: Calculated Columns, Measures, and KPIs, Oh My!##
 
**Abstract**:
To do serious work in a Power Pivot table or even a SQL Analytics Cube, you must know the difference between calculated columns, measures, and KPIs, how to define them, use them, and display them.  This session will take you step by step through the creation of each of these components of a typical pivot table or cube showing you how to define the necessary expressions and then how they are displayed in tables and charts that transform mere data into meaningful managerial information.  To keep examples simple enough for all attendees to go back and try on their own, Excel Power Pivot Tables will be used, but the same techniques apply almost without change to SSAS cubes.

##Title: A practical guide to Windows Azure SQL Database for the DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
What is "Windows Azure SQL Database" all about ? What does this mean for me as a DBA ? What is the process for setting up a Windows Azure database ? How would I go about migrating one of my databases to "The Cloud" ? How do I possibly leverage this new technology in my production environment ? 
If you are a production DBA and have contemplated one or more of these questions, this session is for you! Maybe, you have been tasked with finding out about "The Cloud". Join me in exploring the cloud where I will show you how SQL Server works in the Windows Azure SQL Database world. We will run through the simple process of configuring a Windows Azure SQL database. We will investigate the similarities and differences between on premises SQL Server and Windows Azure SQL Databases. We will even look into the DR, HA, monitoring and performance tuning options available with Windows Azure.

##Title: Analytics and the DBA – Using BI Power tools to visualize your SQL Infrastructure##
 
**Abstract**:
Using BI Power tools to visualize your SQL Infrastructure DBAs do not always have time to work with some of the amazing visual data tools that are becoming common place now for analysts. In this presentation I will show how in just a few very easy steps you can learn more than the basics of PowerView, PowerPivot and Data Mining using data you are already familiar with as a DBA, your SQL Server installation data. We will look at new and interesting way to load, transform, merge and analyze configuration and performance data for many servers simultaneously. I will also demonstrate how to best utilize that data for reports in Excel, SSRS and Visio to get the most out of automation, standardization and visualization with the new Power tools.

##Title: Analysis Services: Show Me Where It Hurts##
 
**Abstract**:
"It's slow" are probably the 2 most dreaded words for any data professional...(right behind "You're fired!")...What's slow? Since when? Compared to what?

Join me in this "something-everyone-should-be-doing-but-isn't" session where we will discuss baselines and performance monitoring for your Analysis Services environment. We'll cover what a baseline is, what information it needs to include, and how it can help you troubleshoot immediate problems and proactively avoid them in the future. Attendees will walk away from this session with a plan that can be implemented next week to help avoid the pain of being caught off guard with Analysis Services performance issues and make troubleshooting a breeze.

##Title: Government Transparency Powered by SharePoint 2013 and Sql 2012##
 
**Abstract**:
I will bring to life how SQL 2012 empowers the BI of SharePoint BI.  Meaning...what parts of SQL yield what parts of SharePoint BI.  Where are the SQL parts, where can you see and manage them?  How does the consumer see them.  How can you tell what the consumer is seeing?  What tools are used to build what parts of SharePoint BI?  Real-life examples of how SharePoint BI is implemented in the City of Jacksonville will be used as examples.  See how your city is using Microsoft Technology to open up the city's data to its citizens.  Think PowerView and Excel (services).

##Title: Smooth Data Moves##
 
**Abstract**:
An exploration into a way to move database data from a source to one or more destinations. This session will show you how to use dynamic bindings at runtime to avoid having to rebuild SSIS packages when schemas change. We will look at sending data to both SQL Server and Oracle databases without even knowing the column names. This metadata-driven solution will help you to develop faster and move data quickly with bcp capabilities.  Attend this session to see how ODP .Net can help you look like a rock star.

##Title: Indexing your Data Warehouse##
 
**Abstract**:
One of the primary skill sets most database professionals are initially required to “master” is the art of proper indexing in our databases. We learn early on that an effective indexing configuration will go further in making our databases perform efficiently than probably any other single tuning technique. What’s not so commonly discussed though are the varying approaches one may wish to utilize when indexing your SQL Server enterprise data warehouse.  This session will hopefully cause you to take a good look at your current indexing to see if indeed it could be operating even more efficiently.

She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville. She has published several articles on SQLServerCentral.com, trains her co-workers in SQL Server, and has previously presented at several SQL Saturday events and JSSUG meetings.

##Title: So you think MDX is hard?##
 
**Abstract**:
A lot of people have this perception that MDX is difficult. It really isn't, when you understand what it is trying to accomplish under the hood. In this session we'll begin with a fundamental understanding of what MDX will do for you. Then we'll roll up our sleeves and dive into MDX code, starting from the simplest select statement and winding up building calculations you can put into your own SSAS Cubes.

##Title: Poor Man's GIS using Tabular and Power View##
 
**Abstract**:
Technical "how to" for property-related projects completed for my employer - City of Jacksonville.  Using data in creative ways, I was able to use SQL, Tabular (DAX) and the mapping capabilities of Power View to create an effective map presentation of city properties that were under-utilized, considered "blight" or otherwise required special attention.  Users can visualize properties with liens, vacant, City-owned, Schools,etc. on the same map (with the address, of course), filtering the map by zip code or city council district.

##Title: Query Tuning - Get it Right the First Time ##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server query tuning is often more art than science and it can quickly eat up a lot of DBA and/or Developer time. This presentation will outline a method for determining the best approach for tuning queries by utilizing response time analysis and SQL diagramming techniques. Regardless of the complexity of the statement, this quick, systematic approach will lead you down the correct tuning path with no guessing. If you are a beginner or expert, this approach will save you countless hours tuning a query.

In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Database Administrator by day and Author by night Brandie Tarvin sails pirate-populated waters, fights evil robots in disguise and turns kingdoms into chaotic rebellious city-states all while coding ETL processes and protecting real-world data from corruption.

In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville.

##Title: Inside the Query Optimizer##
 
**Abstract**:
The Query Optimizer is a black box.  It can be intimidating until you understand it.  Understanding the Optimizer beings with knowing the Rules.  The way our queries are written reflect directly on the output that we get. In this session we will look at the rules in SQL Server, write queries to show those rules in action, and walk out with a better understanding of how the Optimizer works.  This is the first step in learning how to use the Optimizer's rules to make your queries faster!

##Title: Cloudy with a Chance of Data##
 
**Abstract**:
Cloud, Cloud, Cloud.  Microsoft is "all in". CxOs love the idea of renting compute resources.  You know this is where our profession is headed, but when and how fast.  When should you jump on board?  The good news is cloud will not eliminate or even reduce the need for IT and Data professionals.  The bad news is our world and our profession is changing.  Adapt or be left behind.  Come see what Microsoft Azure has to offer Data Professionals.

##Title: DataViz You Thought You Couldn't Do with SSRS##
 
**Abstract**:
Despite SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) being a very flexible and adaptable tool when it comes to visualization techniques, very few venture beyond its ready-made charts. Most of the time, all it takes to build a chart considered “outside the scope” of SSRS is a bit of lateral thinking. Sometimes, we need to go a little further and use custom code. Join this session as we bust popular myths around "impossible in SSRS" visualizations and construct them live in SSRS!

##Title: Data Compression – Why and How##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server’s index compression can have substantial benefits for administration, resource utilization, and query performance.  However, implementing compression can be challenging.  This session will discuss the benefits of compression, some occasional costs to be aware of, and then provide scripts to estimate compression benefits for indices, as well as generate the SQL needed to implement compression for those indices that warrant it.
