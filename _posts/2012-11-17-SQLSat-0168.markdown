## Title: Reporting Services Deep Dive
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Reporting Services is a fundamental part of Microsoft’s Business Intelligence suite of products which as its name suggests provides a centralized robust reporting solution for organizations. Using a familiar development environment we can create static and interactive reports that can be delivered to consumers in a variety of ways. In this deep dive session, I will cover topics like: - What is reporting services and what can it be used for? - Features added in 2008 R2 - Architectural Overview - Demonstrations to cover the entire process of developing, deploying and rendering reports using the built in Report Manager and URL Access. ** This session is SQL Saturday favorite and is always packed full. Don't miss it **

## Title: Hello, My Name Is DAX
 
**Abstract**:
For anyone doing serious work with PowerPivot, you know that you must sometimes create additional columns calculated from the data in your existing data sources.  If your data source is SQL Server, you could do this in SQL directly by just connecting to a custom view.  However, for most other data sources (and for those users without development access to SQL Server) the best alternative is building expressions in PowerPivot to define new columns. DAX is also used to join tables on multiple columns and to create calculated measures.  This session will explore DAX functions and expressions and how they differ from Excel expressions.  We will even show how to use DAX expressions to create new measures.

**Abstract**:
So the big wigs have come up with a “master” report that shows everything you could ever want on a single report.  It includes grids and charts of varying sizes and complexities.  Did I mention they want it pretty as well?  In this session we will discuss how to use SQL Reporting Services 2008 R2 to bring it all together while avoiding the pit falls and mistakes.  The demonstration will show how to build a multi-page, dashboard style report to manage your report server showing a multitude of grids and charts.

## Title: SSIS Package Realtime Visualzation  Analytics
 
**Abstract**:
Implement an SSIS Framework to track the progress of  SSIS production packages similar to how you can in the BIDS Designer, and explore your package withs  windows explorer like capability.Utilizing  the “out of the box” SSIS Logging with no changes required to the existing  logic or packages. The new framework  will also use SSIS to scan existing packages and automatically discover Master / Child package relationships and providing a capability for package restartability. This design pattern can be use to replace earlier “Stored Proc” version of SSIS Framework greatly reducing the code required. This functionality is complementary to the 2012 Package Tracking capability.
