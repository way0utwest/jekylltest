##Title: Modern Concerns about Reporting Style with Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
Reports are no longer just black and white columns and rows of numbers.  Reports combine tables with charts and KPIs and more.  Visually, there is a lot to be concerned with when designing your report to get the right information across to your audience.  You must consider the way you display your data, the amount of data displayed, the use of color and maybe even the use of animation.  Creating attractive reports is not just about making them pretty.  It is about grabbing your audience's attention.  It is making sure you don't inadvertently introduce ADA (American Disabilities Act) problems that will detract from your message if your audience cannot understand or interpret your data.  This session while looking at some reporting best practices will also give you information to steer you clear of ADA concerns to keep your data's message on track.

##Title: Full Azure Automation with PowerShell##
 
**Abstract**:
PowerShell is the robust automation language for Windows. When extended Azure modules, you get a robust Azure automation platform.  In this presentation, we’ll explain how to create, inquire about, and manage Azure resources from the client-side using PowerShell.  Then we’ll look at how to create PowerShell automation jobs called Runbooks within Azure and the features of using this approach.   Finally, we’ll see how we can get the best of both approaches by using the Azure Automation Authoring Toolkit, a PowerShell ISE Add-On that seamlessly integrates local PowerShell development and testing with cloud based Azure Runbooks.  If you plan to use Azure, you need PowerShell, the Azure automation language so come to this presentation to get started.

##Title: Uptight Database Security##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you work for an institution that fears it’s DBAs could go rogue on their production databases? 
Do you want to revoke continuous sysadmin permissions from your DBA team in an attempt to avoid being the next WikiLeak? 
Do you have concerns that the DBA team is querying sensitive databases?
Then, you need Uptight Database Security. 
Come to this session to learn how to deploy a configurable permission model that provides on-demand access to SQL Server databases. This model allows DBAs to do routine work without sysadmin, elevate permissions to sysadmin only during production emergencies or disaster recovery scenarios. Attendees  will leave this session with the fundamental knowledge and scripts to implement a low hassle solution that provides DBAs the minimum necessary access required to maintain a production database server.

##Title: SQL Server Then and Now: Changing the State of Long-held Beliefs##
 
**Abstract**:
We’ve all heard the rules for SQL Server like separate your data from your log, watch for a disk queue length over 2, and a low Page Life Expectancy always means memory pressure.  All of these used to be true, but on today’s hardware and SQL Server versions – they are dangerously outdated.  In this session, we will take on a bunch of these old “givens” of SQL Server that everybody has heard and followed, the underlying technological reasons they were true then, how today’s technology has rendered them obsolete, and what the new rules are that you need to know.  So whether you are one of the old guard looking to refresh your set of working SQL Server rules or a member of the up-and-comers looking for the facts to win over the old guard, this session is for you.

##Title: Collecting Performance Metrics##
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever had a manager standing over your shoulder, wanting to know why a server is running slowly? Or whether or not a server can handle additional workload? What information would you use to answer these questions? How would you share this information with your manager? The answer is baseline metrics.

Only if you have baseline performance information can you answer these questions and form a plan to address the issues at hand. In this session, we will be discussing several open source tools you can combine into an inexpensive baselining system you can use to troubleshoot issues and answer important questions.

Attendees in this session will learn how to collect important metric data, what data to collect, and how to interpret that data and develop a plan of action to address any issues.

##Title: Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent##
 
**Abstract**:
The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT, and Prod is a challenge whether on-premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.

##Title: The Modern Data Architecture, Big Data and Data Science##
 
**Abstract**:
Data Science techniques are becoming popular and because statistics usually is teach at the Math Department people think of it as an exact science but Statistic is the science of prediction and expectations. In the exciting of the possibilities that Big Data technology and Data Science techniques are opening, we are forgetting that correlation is not equal than causation and that any design model have intrinsic limitations because of the false positives and false negatives. 
Dr. Deming said "In God we trust, all others must bring data." but what he really wanted to reach was Wisdom! Data is just the raw material the real goal is Wisdom I have been thinking about the chain toward Wisdom (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) and wonder how many organizations have reach, at least, the level of Knowledge and if any at all has reached the pinnacle of Wisdom. 
We are drowning in a sea of data and we are starving for wisdom.
In this presentation I intent to expose limitations and opportunities

##Title: Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks; Tame the Sibling Rivalry##
 
**Abstract**:
Like parents having to break up a fight between battling siblings, SQL Server must do the same for conflicting transactions. We call these Deadlocks and they can present a problem to many DBAs. Deadlocks can be minor fights or major issues making SQL Server continually choose a side like constantly quarreling siblings.

To understand how Deadlocking occurs, we must understand what caused the fight . Learning about basic locking and blocking of SQL Server is a great place to start.

By the end of this session you will walk away with the knowledge of how the locking/blocking mechanism works, the basics of deadlocking, and what Isolation Levels are . You will know how these can help or hurt your situation.  Finally you will have the power to capture, report, and stop the family fighting.

##Title: A Rocket Scientist Perspective on Indexes##
 
**Abstract**:
Indexes can be a boon or detriment for database performance. This presentation will present what they are (in layman’s terms) and how they may affect query performance – both from a read (SELECT) viewpoint as well as a data modification aspect (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).  This session will focus on a deep dive into clustered indexes, Primary Keys, and nonclustered indexes (including B-tree traversal), their syntax and utilization, and their effect on performance in transaction and data warehouse databases.  Covering nonclustered indexes will also be examined in detail.  There will be many live query demos illustrating index utilization and performance using statistics and query plans. Some knowledge of Management Studio and TSQL is recommended.

##Title: Going Asynchronous with Service Broker##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have complex operations that have already been tuned for optimum performance, but still run too long for a good end user application experience? If you do, Service Broker may be the solution. 

This session will explain the benefits of asynchronous processing in Service Broker compared to other options like SQL Agent jobs or SSIS packages, and how to implement the basic components required. Even in SQL Server 2014, Service Broker lacks a UI integration, which is sometimes a road block for implementations. Not to worry, this session will show you how to configure Service Broker correctly the first time so you can develop easy, foolproof deployments to solve complicated problems.

##Title: Cautionary Tale of Recompilations, Excessive CPU Load and Plan Caching##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server reduces compilation and optimization overhead by caching and reusing execution plans for the queries. Plan caching helps to reduce CPU load on the server; however, it may also introduce unexpected issues and lead to suboptimal execution plans and performance problems.  

In this session, Dmitri will explain how plan caching works internally and demonstrate how to address several common issues related to the plan caching. He will talk about parameter sniffing, simple and forced parameterization, OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN strategy, and several other related topics.    Finally, Dmitri will provide the guidelines how to reduce CPU load and recompilation overhead in the systems with heavy ad-hoc workload and non-parameterized queries.

##Title: Spot the Potential Breakpoints in your Automated Process##
 
**Abstract**:
We all have automated processes that were built in a rush and as long as everything is right, it works very well.  Then, several months later, after you have shoved the relevant knowledge about it to the corner of your brain, something happens that you didnt expect and the process fails.  You fix it, and it works again, but something else comes up and it breaks again.  This interactive presentation helps to show how to identify the potential break-points in a proces.  We will review 2 case scenarios: SFTP process which pulls files from a vendor and a log shipping process.  For each scenario, we will disect each part of the process and find out where the vulnerabilities are.

##Title: Tuning Like CSS: With These Tools There's No Need Call Support##
 
**Abstract**:
What do you do when you have a performance or troubleshooting problem that you can’t figure out? One option is to open a support ticket with Microsoft Support (CSS). The CSS engineer will use a specific set of tools to collect and analyze workload data from your SQL Server. Based on this information they might recommend patches, configuration changes, or identify the worst-performing queries.
 
But what if you could bypass support and do all of this analysis yourself?
 
In this session, you'll learn how to use battle tested tools to analyze your workload, read crash dumps, and error logs. Armed with this information, you'll understand the root cause of the problem and propose solutions to performance and stability problems. Finally, you'll learn the basics of debugging SQL Server so that when you finally run into a problem you can't solve, you'll be able to help Microsoft support help you.

##Title: Python in SQL Server 2017##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2017 has finally arrived, bringing with it a host of exciting new features.  Of particular interest to BI practitioners and data scientists is the integration of the Python programming language into the SQL ecosystem.  This integration opens up a number of possibilities for in-database analytics and intelligent database applications, so let's get started!

In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the Python language and then look at how to install and administer Machine Learning Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of Python by showing you how to create and run simple scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.  Finally, we'll go through some examples of how to use Python to integrate data analytical methods in real-world situations, and wow your customers with the power of analytics!

##Title: vNUMA, pNUMA, save your SQL Servers from certain DoomA##
 
**Abstract**:
When presented with large SQL Server workloads in a virtual environment, which cross NUMA boundaries, it is very important to understand how the hypervisor presents vNUMA to the SQL Server virtual machine.  When there is a NUMA imbalance, it can have as much as a 40% impact on performance, causing a significant effect on your virtual environment.  In this session attendees will learn ways to optimize vNUMA including:
•	How vNUMA works across different processors; and the ways that Intel and AMD are different
•	Methods for determining if a NUMA imbalance exists
•	Which settings at the hypervisor, or virtual machine level, should be changed to ensure the best performance

##Title: Twitter Data  Sentiment Analysis: Staring Logic Apps, Azure ML, Twitter Data, Power BI, and Python##
 
**Abstract**:
Six months ago we went to Spider-man: Homecoming.  On the way home I thought “I wonder what the rest of the world thinks of this movie?  I wonder what people on Twitter are saying?  I wonder if this is that tied to box office performance?”  Over the last six months we’ve been building data sets on movies and collecting sentiment analysis of Twitter data.  This lead to a journey of data discovery.  First to figure out how to capture and analyze social media data from Twitter.  Next we needed box office information.  After that we wanted to capture sentiment.  Then we wanted stock market data.  Then we wanted movie information, runtime, rating, Metacritic score, IMDB score, and then how do we get historical data if we want to increase our data set?  Once you collect the data how do you store it?  How do you display it?  All this and more….. but probably just this….because that’s a lot.

The Stinger initiative accomplished just that! In this session, Luis Figueroa (Solutions Engineer @ Hortonworks) will walk you through the latest advancements that make Hadoop a powerful SQL engine that expands you EDW capabilities with unlimited scale and amazing flexibility. Luis will provide a technical overview of the Hive engine, an update on SQL compatibility with the ANSI standard, real world use cases and a live demo. If you are a data pro this session is for you!

##Title: SQL Server R Services in SQL 2016##
 
**Abstract**:
One of the most exciting new features of SQL Server 2016 is the integration of the R statistical programming language into the platform with the brand-new SQL Server R Services.  In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the R language and then look at how to install and administer SQL Server R Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of R by showing you how to create and run simple R scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.  Finally, we'll go through some examples of how to use R to integrate data analytical methods in real-world situations, and wow your customers with the power of statistics!

##Title: Don't Get Lost in Translation: Multilingual Reporting in SSRS##
 
**Abstract**:
Today's modern global business environment necessitates information being available in the end user's native language. In the past this challenge has been met in a variety of ways with mixed results. Often companies maintain multiple sets of reports and data per language or implement solutions which perform poorly and are difficult to manage. The solution presented here is scalable,  easily managed and performs better than commonly used solutions.
This session will highlight how to create a pivoted dataset for the translated text, use native SSRS functions and change translations based on the user's browser locale information. At the end of this session you will have a dynamic and robust method to handle multiple languages for reporting.

##Title: Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Services, and Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft Cognitive services is a series of services based on Microsoft Research using Deep Learning techniques, ready for you to enrich your unstructured data. Microsoft Services includes: Vision (Computer Vision, Emotion, Face, Video), Speech/Language (Speaker Recognition, Spell, Sentiment, Language, Key Phrases, Topic detection, Linguistic Analysis), Knowledge, and Search. These services are consumed by using the Cognitive Services APIs. Power BI enables you to consume the APIs to enrich your unstructured data inside your Power BI solutions. During this session, we will cover how to consume the API using Power Query to then visualize the results with Power BI visuals. We will also consume the Cognitive services API by using a R script inside Power BI. This session is structured with a B2C Survey case study solution with a real time Dashboard using a streaming dataset.

##Title: SQL Server ColumnStore Indexes##
 
**Abstract**:
Come and learn how the SQL Server 2012 feature, ColumnStore Indexes, can parallelize your Data Warehouse aggregations. I will be doing a deep dive into the inner workings of ColumnStore indexes; how they work, key characteristics, dos and don'ts, restrictions, and more. I will have some insight into how CSI's have been updated in SQL Server 2014  2016, as well.
	If you are a production DBA who needs to find out more about some of the additional hot features that have been included with CSI's, like batch mode processing and data segments, then this session is for you. If you are a BI DBA or developer who needs to find out how CSI's can increase the performance of your aggregations and star-joins by up to 40 times, then this session is also for you.

##Title: Securing SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
A default SQL Server installation is reasonably secure, but quot;reasonably securequot; doesn't cut it in an era in which one bad line of code, one weak password, or one open port can result in your customer database ending up on Pastebin. In this talk, we will look at different methods of securing a SQL Server instance, from venerable (principle of least privilege, Transparent Data Encryption) to novel (Always Encrypted, row-level security). These tools and techniques will show us ways for developers, database administrators, and network specialists to work together to secure SQL Server instances.

##Title: Azure Sql PAAS: Lessons from the Real World##
 
**Abstract**:
So you're using Azure Sql Database Platform As A Service. Now what? Without a physical machine, how do you do restore? Where are the backup files? When are service packs applied? Can service packs be rolled up thru dev to production? What's a service level and how does it impact database design? How do we encrypt, authorize, query tune, restore...?  We'll go over these questions and any others that you may have.

##Title: Welcome To the 2016 Query Store!##
 
**Abstract**:
One of my favorite new features in SQL Server 2016 is the Query Store. The Query Store houses valuable information on performance of your queries as well as gives you great insights into your query workload. This presentation will take a look at the Query Store, how it works and the type of information it holds. You will learn how to use the Query Store to quickly find plan changes and analyze performance issues caused by them.  New DMVs will be introduced and the performance impact of enabling the Query Store will be discussed. Both DBAs and developers can increase their performance tuning skills by attending this session.

##Title: The DBA Survival Guide for In-Memory OLTP##
 
**Abstract**:
You know it's coming . . . one day soon, you'll be asked to take ownership of a database that uses In-Memory OLTP. Then what?

Deploying In-Memory OLTP affects the database ecosystem, including monitoring, data migration, logging, capacity planning, backup, restore, recovery, and more.

DBAs need to know optimal methods of migrating large data sets from disk to In-Memory, the differences between restore and recovery for memory-optimized databases, and many other facets of the In-Memory world.  

Attendees will gain a clear understanding of the knowledge and skills required to administer In-Memory OLTP environments.

##Title: Migrations 101##
 
**Abstract**:
The only constant thing is change. As companies continue to migrate to newer versions or different data centers, we need to develop strategies and tools to make sure we can perform successful migrations. What if we had a checklist? Just like moving to a new home the success of the "move" relies on the preparation. This presentation will go over a checklist of steps needed to prepare for a database migration.

##Title: Lessons Learned from Two Years as a Devops DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
Join me as I talk about lessons learned from two years on a Devops team. Process, source control, changes that block, rolling back changes, out of band changes, and more! I still don't have all the answers (or maybe even all the questions), but I can say this - DBA's have nothing to fear and a lot to gain when an org adopts a devops culture.

##Title: 13 Tips for an Effective Job Search##
 
**Abstract**:
It’s no surprise that embarking upon a job search can be a high-anxiety time.  However, following an effective job search process and applying best practices when it comes to your resume and professional online marketing channels (including 4 current key resume truths), working with Recruiters, always attempting the "referral route," leveraging alerts and other strategies, etc. can help reduce frustrations and make it better.  In this session, we’ll highlight our top 13 strategies to help you go from "I'm not finding jobs I'm interested in" and/or "I'm not hearing back on my resume or from Recruiters" to "it's time to prepare for my interview!"

##Title: Hack / Protect SQL Server - Come learn both.##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, I'll show you how to hack SQL Server using a simple C# console application and other tools. Most importantly, I'll show you how to protect these vectors that perhaps you're trying to use to safeguard sensitive data for GDPR compliance.

1. Tabular Data Stream (TDS) Protocol
2. Dynamic Data Masking
3. Row Level Security (Yep...)
4. Database Source Control

Perhaps, you've seen these exploits before but do you really know how to reproduce them? Or, how to even protect yourself against them?

No worries, I'll show you the way along with a load test.

##Title: SQL Style##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL is different than most languages. As such, there's a particular style of though that works best with SQL. This presentation will focus on the things that books and tutorials don't. It will provide some perspective about the language and how to break large problems in smaller, more manageable ones. 

Even if you've been writing SQL, this discussion might make challenging tasks easier!

##Title: Dynamic Data Masking - A Deep Dive Implementation##
 
**Abstract**:
One of the highly touted features of SQL 2016 is Dynamic Data Masking (DDM).  In this session, we will take an in-depth deep dive into implementing DDM and discover its good, bad, and indifferent features.  We will discuss use cases where DDM can help and where it may hinder development, QA, or auditing use cases.  Attendees will leave the session with the knowledge needed to deploy a comprehensive DDM solution in their environments should DDM be a match for their use cases.  High level data protection and auditing topics will be discussed as well.
