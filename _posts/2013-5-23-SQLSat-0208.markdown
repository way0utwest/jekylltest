##Title: T-SQL Performance Guidelines for better DB stress ##
 
**Abstract**:
To reach your desired business functionalities, it  can be easy using some common T-SQL practices  like MTVF , scalar functions , Temp tables, Union…etc  and they might perform pretty well on development server coz neither adequate stress of users is exists there but actually they seem totally strange once going to live and they become performing badly ending up with standstill cases sometimes  , this is due to lack of stress powers of T-SQL codes which should be considered largely for critical mission DBs so I am going to talk to you about How to capture expensive queries using different techniques ..?and How to optimize them in the shortest time using scientific ways ..?

##Title: SQL Server Data platform upgrade Techniques, best practices  notes from the field##
 
**Abstract**:
Why Upgrade?
This is the big question that every SQL Server user will be asking, from my experience I say not just for shiny new features but increase your productivity and do-more with-less practices.
Data Platform Upgrade topic has been a popular session that I've presented in major conferences like Microsoft Tech-Ed (North America, Europe  India) and SQLbits.
In this session, we will overview end-to-end upgrade process that covers the essential phases, steps and issues involved in upgrading SQL Server 2000, 2005,  SQL Server 2008 R2 (with a good overview on 2012 too) by using best practices and available resources. We will cover the complete upgrade cycle, including the preparation tasks, upgrade tasks, and post-upgrade tasks. Real-world examples from my Consulting experience expanding on why  how such a solution is offered.

##Title: SQL Server 2012 Parallel Data Warehouse Appliance##
 
**Abstract**:
PDW is a massively parallel processing data warehousing appliance built for any volume of relational data (with up to 100x performance gains) and provides the simplest integration to Hadoop.

SQL Server 2012 Parallel Data Warehouse introduces PolyBase, a fundamental breakthrough in data processing used to enable seamless integration between traditional data warehouses and “Big Data” deployments.

-       Use standard SQL queries (instead of MapReduce) to access and join Hadoop data with relational data.

-       Query Hadoop data without IT having to pre-load data first into the warehouse.

-       Native Microsoft BI Integration allowing analysis of relational and non-relational data with familiar tools like Excel.

Scale and perform beyond your traditional SQL Server deployment with PDW’s massively parallel processing (MPP) appliance that can handle the extremes of your largest mission critical requirements of performance and scale.

##Title: Elements of Storage Performance##
 
**Abstract**:
Today it is possible to achieve exceptional storage performance for SQL Server without excessive costs. Unfortunately the solution proposed by storage system vendors generally ignores the special characteristics of database engines (not just SQL Server), resulting in marginal if not poor performance. Learn how to match the hardware elements of storage including IO channels, the role of cache, and the components hard drives, SSD - both enterprise class and lower cost options to the characteristics of SQL Server IO to achieve realizable query performance.

##Title: Inheriting a database for Developers, version 2##
 
**Abstract**:
There are very few applications which are being developed from zero, the most are apps are simply inherited from previous development teams. This session serves to show some easy implementable practices to follow after inheriting a database. Those practices allow to check some if the database design was done in regards to the actual data, or if while implementing some of the constraints and checks some tables were left behind. :) The practices shown in this session will allow to check the database design and identify some of the possible performance degradations.
