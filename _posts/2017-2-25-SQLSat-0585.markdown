##Title: SQL Server Reporting Services 2016 on Steroids!!##
 
**Abstract**:
Reporting requests that are required ‘yesterday or sooner’, oft times necessitate working more efficiently and effectively. We have all been through this at one time or another.
In this hands on presentation we shall be looking some of the more challenging techniques of extracting our data from our Multidimensional and Tabular Models, in addition to our Data Mining Models. 
We shall be utilizing concepts of  ‘Openquery()’ and ‘linked servers’ as a means to extract data,  in addition to looking at the way that these two concepts can help us extract our data utilizing MDX, DMX and DAX expressions;  AND YET maintain the  flexibility and the ability to utilize all those wonderful techniques that may  be done with T-SQL.

##Title: A Good DBA Works Smarter not Harder##
 
**Abstract**:
How many instances of SQL are in your environment? Are there any rogue SQL Servers installed? Do you manage each of them? Do you know if they are setup correctly?

There are many free tools out there to help you effectively manage your environment.

In this session we are going to be interactive, we are going to talk about points of pain and we are going to zoom in on several free tools to help you identify, manage and maintain your SQL Server environments. We'll take these tools and take you on a journey from discovering your instances, configuring the discovered environment, setting up policies to keep things happy, implement maintenance and perform baselines and performance analysis.

##Title: No Schema, No Problem! – Introduction to Azure DocumentDB##
 
**Abstract**:
This session presents an overview of Azure DocumentDB, Microsoft's massively-scalable, fully managed NoSQL database platform designed specifically for modern web and mobile applications. Like other NoSQL platforms, DocumentDB supports a schema-free data model and scales easily. But it also offers several unique features that make it a compelling candidate for NoSQL scenarios.

We begin by explaining NoSQL and document databases, and how they compare with traditional relational database platforms. Then we tour the many features of DocumentDB, including rich querying with SQL (that’s right, you query this NoSQL database using SQL!), and client development using the REST API and the DocumentDB SDKs. Next, learn about the server-side programming model and write fully transactional stored procedures, triggers, and user-defined functions. Also explore tunable consistency, scale-out partitioning, custom indexing, attachments, and more. Attend this session, and get up to speed on DocumentDB to

##Title: Should I move my database to the cloud?##
 
**Abstract**:
So you have been running on-prem SQL Server for a while now.  Maybe you have taken the step to move it from bare metal to a VM, and have seen some nice benefits.  Ready to see a TON more benefits?  If you said "YES!", then this is the session for you as I will go over the many benefits gained by moving your on-prem SQL Server to an Azure VM (IaaS).  Then I will really blow your mind by showing you even more benefits by moving to Azure SQL Database (PaaS/DBaaS).  And for those of you with a large data warehouse, I also got you covered with Azure SQL Data Warehouse.  Along the way I will talk about the many hybrid approaches so you can take a gradual approve to moving to the cloud.  If you are interested in cost savings, additional features, ease of use, and ending the days of upgrading hardware, this is the session for you!

##Title: SQL Server High Availability in Azure IaaS##
 
**Abstract**:
Deploying mission critical SQL Server in Azure IaaS requires an in-depth understanding of storage, virtual networks, load balancers, SQL Server AlwaysOn and more. To qualify for Azure’s SLA of 99.95% availability, steps must be taken to mitigate downtime by leveraging Fault Domains and Update Domains in conjunction with traditional HA options.

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) replaces Azure “Classic” as the preferred deployment method in Azure. New features such as Deployment Templates and Resource Groups introduced in ARM make it a powerful tool in managing the entire life-cycle of SQL Server in Azure.

In this session attendees will learn how to leverage ARM to deploy SQL AlwaysOn Availability Groups and Failover Cluster Instances. Template Deployments and manual configurations using the Azure Portal and Azure PowerShell will be demonstrated.

##Title: T-SQL : Bad Habits and Best Practices##
 
**Abstract**:
Whether you are a developer, DBA, or anything in between, chances are you are not always following best practices when you write T-SQL. Unfortunately, many so-called “bad habits” aren’t always obvious, but can lead to poor performance, maintainability issues, and compatibility problems.

In this session, you will learn about several bad habits, how they develop, and how you can avoid them. While we will briefly discuss advice you’ve probably heard before, like avoid SELECT * and don’t use NOLOCK, you will also learn some subtleties in SQL Server that might surprise you, how some shorthand can bite you in the long run, and a very easy way to improve cursor performance.

By changing your techniques and ditching some of these bad habits for best practices, you will take new techniques back to your environment that will lead to more efficient code, a more productive workflow, or both.

##Title: SQLCmd Mode - The T-SQL Easy Button##
 
**Abstract**:
Ever found yourself writing a T-SQL script and wishing you could do a relatively simple task that T-SQL just doesn't support? Like running a SQL script and passing in parameters at run-time? Or using a variable across multiple connections without using a linked server? Or run the script across multiple instances in a single window?

SQLCmd mode in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is the answer to these problems and many more. Unfortunately, most people don't even know about these capabilities. It's the T-SQL easy button that almost nobody uses!

This demo-heavy session will teach you how to leverage new capabilities that have been at your finger-tips the whole time ... well at least since 2008.

##Title: Designing an SSIS Framework##
 
**Abstract**:
Enterprise data integration changed with the introduction of the SSIS Catalog. Implementing enterprise data integration often requires functionality beyond the rich features provided by the SSIS Catalog. Building on his previous work in the field of Data Integration Life Cycle Management (DILM) and SSIS Frameworks development, a Data Integration Architect with 10 years of SSIS experience explains the what, why, and how of an SSIS Catalog-integrated Framework that delivers metadata-driven package execution, connections management, and parameter configuration.

In this session, you will learn:
- A method for migrating packages from Development, through the data integration life cycle, to Production without editing SSIS Connection Manager Properties.
- A metadata-driven approach to SSIS package execution.
- A method for customizing enterprise data integration reporting.

##Title: Read Dirty to Me - Isolation Levels/User Impact##
 
**Abstract**:
Issue a "SELECT {data} FROM {myTable}" statement and users need to trust the data returned is accurate. What happens when multiple processes access the same data? What happens further if one of those process is an UPDATE or even a DELETE statement? How about if both processes will be updating that data? Understanding Isolation in SQL Server is paramount in ensuring data integrity in your system. We will cover the different levels of isolation and how they impact what a user views when accessing the data at a given point-in-time.

**Abstract**:
Are you a DBA familiar with some basic Windows clustering and database mirroring concepts, and now you're considering AlwaysOn Availability Groups? This session is for you! I'll cover the pros and cons of four typical configurations of AlwaysOn Availability Groups: stand-alone instances, fail-over cluster instances, multi-subnet configurations, and disaster-recovery-on-the-cheap. I'll also discuss read-only routing, and implications and limitations of the Availability Group Listener. In addition, you'll learn why you should be using Windows Server 2012 R2 or above for your Windows clusters. Join me to learn which configuration options you should choose for your Availability Group.

##Title: The SQL Server v.Next Availability Story on Linux##
 
**Abstract**:
Although the paint on SQL Server 2016 just finished drying, Microsoft is already working on v.Next and preview builds are already available. One of the biggest changes is that SQL Server will be supported on Linux in addition to Windows Server. This means that all of the considerations we have for deploying instances and databases will be relevant and possibly different on Linux. While the story is still a work in progress, this session will cover how SQL Server v.Next can be made available based on what is known at this time. If you want to get a head start with SQL Server on Linux, this session is for you.

##Title: Dealing with Data Quality Issues in an SSIS Data Flow##
 
**Abstract**:
Anyone who has worked with SSIS has dealt with the frustration of poor data quality and cryptic error messages. Microsoft has gotten better at providing better error messages within the Data Flow task, but still falls short in some areas.  In this session we will discover how to get the real error message in a data flow task and how to isolate the rows causing the errors.  We will start by reviewing a solution developed using a script component and progress to a method used to identify data quality issues before an error occurs.  We will also discuss other options to handling data quality and errors.

##Title: Execution Plans: What Can You Do With Them?##
 
**Abstract**:
People are aware that you can use an execution plan to tune a query, but do they have other uses? This session will drill down on all the hidden information within execution plans. The structures and information with an execution plan shows many of the inner workings of SQL Server. From calculated columns to referential integrity, these, and many other functions, are exposed through execution plans. From this session you’ll be able to better understand the inner workings of SQL Server as well as your own databases and queries.

##Title: WIT: Identifying, Understanding and Combating Gender Bias  Inequality##
 
**Abstract**:
Gender Bias is something we're all guilty of. It's typically unconscious and often stems from long held misperceptions about women and job responsibilities. We'll learn about the origins of some of these biases and how to identify gender bias when we see it. We'll discuss some strategies for how both men and women can combat this at work and in our every day lives. This session is about developing positive solutions to a problem that often goes undiscussed.

##Title: Intro to Azure SQL Databases##
 
**Abstract**:
Azure SQL Databases are still something that is new and not completely understood by many data professionals. There is a definite shift from installing SQL Server on a machine to creating and using a Microsoft's Platform-as-a-Service database. This session will cover the basics of what an Azure SQL Database is, how we create one, and what it takes to access and use this database. After attending this session, you will have a solid understanding of what Azure SQL Database is, how to configure it, and how to use in your own environment.

##Title: Dynamic SQL: Writing Efficient Queries on the Fly##
 
**Abstract**:
Dynamic SQL can be a powerful tool that allows you to write fast  efficient queries when the specifics may not be known until run-time.  It can also be complex, difficult to read and debug, and the source of some of the most confusing TSQL you'll ever see.

Explore the many uses for dynamic SQL as well as best practices for writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining it, with the bonus of helping to improve the sanity of your coworkers (and your own) in the process!

##Title: SQL Server Infrastructure – Cloud and On-Prem Options##
 
**Abstract**:
Years ago, DBAs worked side-by-side with the infrastructure teams who managed the equipment their databases ran on. Today, organizations are more siloed than ever, and DBAs have less visibility into this layer than ever before. What is actually under the OS? Why does it matter? 

Physical servers, enterprise virtualization, and cloud servers all provide solid platforms for you to run your databases on, but improperly configured and tuned platforms can lead to performance nightmares. Let’s explore the various layers, options, and performance characteristics of the different systems underneath SQL Server so you can improve the performance of your systems.
