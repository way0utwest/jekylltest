## Title: Data Profiling Using SSIS Data Profiling Task
 
**Abstract**:
This session will be exploring the SSIS Data Profiling task to quickly analyze your data.  I will be reviewing the different profiles available, and explaining the limitations of the Data Profiling task.  I will be showing you how to use the different profiles to help you identify candidate keys, null value counts by column, dependencies between columns, length distribution, data format, etc.  
I will be performing a number of Data Profiling task demos that demonstrate how to use and configure the different profiles.  Knowing how to use Data Profiling and interpreting the output helps you quickly determine how best to migrate newly received data into your environment.
I will also be showing you how to use the Data Profiling task output to control your SSIS data flow.  Additionally I will also be showing you how you can store profiling output in SQL Server, so you can produce trend reports based on profile output information.

## Title: Measuring BI Adoption: Dog Food Is Good For You
 
**Abstract**:
The most elegant solution in the world is a waste of money  effort if your users don't actually use it. Just deploying to Prod isn't enough. And simply asking your users if they like it (of if they'll sign off on UAT) isn't sufficient. Come on! We're data-people! We need proof! Proactively capturing usage information is a great way to measure user adoption  prove to your users  management that your solution is delivering a return on their investment. Or if things are bad, understand who's using it  who's not to help target your marketing  training efforts  enhancement cycles.

This session will focus on how to eat our own dog food  measure the performance of our BI solutions.  We'll focus on gathering usage stats for solutions across the core MSBI Stack (Relational DB, SSIS, SSRS, SSAS).  We'll use out-of-the-box log data, server-side traces  DMVs to capture these data points.  Then we'll look at ways to present this data back to stakeholders in scorecard format.

## Title: Lean BI Solutions w PowerPivot, Tabular  a Mullet
 
**Abstract**:
Business in the front. Party in the Back. The Mullet strikes a nice balance between "Classy"  "Outlaw".  By applying this model to BI, we'll uncover ways to deliver solutions faster  more efficiently through Lean practices. This session is for anyone who needs to satisfy demanding customers that aren't quite sure what they want, but they need it NOW or they'll lose that critical deal  the world will end!  We'll focus on sequencing deliverables and using PowerPivot prototypes that can be promoted to an AS Tabular model if/when needed.  This process aims to minimize rework while striking a balance between delivering value fast with initial "Cowboy" efforts, and incrementally building a responsible, scalable, maintainable architecture.

## Title: Store This! Why storage matters when virtualizing SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft SQL Server has become one of the most commonly virtualized applications. In fact, a 2012 VMware customer survey found that 52% of all SQL Server instances were virtualized, up from only 43% in 2010. Since there are multiple types of storage and various protocols that storage can be presented to the guest virtual machine, it is important that DBA’s understand where the database and log files should reside for the best possible performance and ease of management.  In this session you will learn the benefits of a properly configured data management architecture for virtualized SQL Server environments which will provide easier failover, hardware abstraction and simpler capacity planning.  We will also demonstrate multiple ways to configure SQL Server storage in a virtual environment as well as best practices, caveats, and performance tips.

## Title: Data Quality Services Approach to Cleansing
 
**Abstract**:
Learn about Microsoft’s Data Quality Services (DQS), what it is and how it works. You will discover how DQS sets itself apart from conventional data cleansing routines and go through examples on how to begin your own Data Quality Project. What really makes DQS unique and powerful is its ability to access shared knowledge, so we will show you how to access and use this shared knowledge to your benefit.

## Title: Windows Azure SQL Database - your cloud database
 
**Abstract**:
This session will take an exploratory look at Microsoft's cloud-based relational database offering. We'll lift the hood and look at its many benefits and features, and how it easily fills the need for a highly available and scalable database service in the cloud. We'll discuss how the database formally known as SQL Azure helps ease provisioning and deployment, and how Microsoft takes care of the physical administration so that developers and DBA's alike can focus on the aspects of their job they really care about.

## Title: Unleashing Common Table Expressions in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever wanted to create a recursive query, but didn't see how to do it. With the Common Table Expressions class you will learn everything needed to start using CTE's for recursive queries, as temporary views, and to use the result set multiple times in the same query. Learn how simplify query syntax using CTE's. One of the most overlooked features of SQL Server is the CTE which not only simplifies the query, but gives you the ability to do things that would otherwise be impossible (or at least very challenging) with SQL Server.  Learn how recursive CTE’s perform better than other methods to create hierarchical results.  See how CTE’s compare to SQL Server 2012 offset and fetch paging techniques.

## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs
 
**Abstract**:
If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

## Title: SQL 2012 Error Handling. Pick your Destiny
 
**Abstract**:
Gone are all the spaghetti errors of past versions of SQL. For example did you know that BEGIN TRAN…COMMIT TRAN is not enough to make everything work together? People are often shocked when they see the demo in this talk where the first statement fails and all others statements still commit. This can still happen to you in SQL 2012 if you are not aware of the options. In fact did you know that when SQL encounters an error of Severity 11 (or higher), there a 4 different ways it can react? Learn how to predict the Error Action and control it. This is possible with or without structured error handling. See both ways to control the outcome to the way you want it.

## Title: Why I Won't Be Hiring You
 
**Abstract**:
You're a DBA or SQL Developer and you are looking for a new gig. You've trawled the job sites, found a position I am hiring for, and decided that it is the job for you. You spruce up your resume and send it in, hoping for the best.

In this session I will go over some critical mistakes that will prevent you from getting a job, such as:
 - Why your resume is an instant turn-off
 - That thing you said on the phone screen that was flat out wrong
 - Why the in-person interviewer took an immediate dislike to you

## Title: AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
 
**Abstract**:
In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic fail-over using a real web app to see how well this feature works.

## Title: Machine Learning for Mere Mortals
 
**Abstract**:
Machine learning is the science of building predictive models from available data, in order to predict the behavior of new data. It is the practice of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. 

ML is widely used in web search (Google, Bing), recommendation engines (Netflix and Amazon), computational vision (self-driving cars), and natural language processing (Google Translate, auto-grading essays).

This will be a gentle introduction into the world of machine learning. We will cover common techniques such as clustering, supervised vs unsupervised learning, and learning at scale. Finally, we'll explore some examples of machine learning in the real world.
