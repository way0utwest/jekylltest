## Title: The 20% of DAX That Gets You 80% of the Way There
 
**Abstract**:
For those of us coming from a SQL background It's easy to get intimidated by DAX.  It's a weird language meant to appeal to Excel people while also mimicking much of the functionality of MDX.  This session will cover the topics that will make you productive immediately with DAX.  Those topics are 1) Calculated Columns v. Measures, 2) Implicit vs. Explicit Measures, 3) the CALCULATE function, 4) Time Intelligence,  5) CUBEVALUE.  This is truly the 20% of DAX that will make you productive in 80% of situations.  We're going to start with a working data model and start building calculations right away - bring your laptop.

## Title: Create and Load a Staging Environment from Scratch in an Hour with Biml
 
**Abstract**:
Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) automates your BI patterns and eliminates the manual repetition that consumes most of your SSIS development time. During this hour long presentation, Scott Currie from Varigence will use the free BIDSHelper add-in for BIDS and SSDT to introduce Biml and use to automatically generate large quantities of custom SSIS packages. The session will be largely demonstration driven, and reusable sample code will be distributed for you to use in your own projects. Using a live-typing approach, Scott will start from scratch and by the end of the session create a full-blown staging environment. This will include the creation of *hundreds* of target table creation scripts, data load packages, data scrubbing rules, logging, and more. The best part is that you can freely reuse the code in your own environment just by changing the connection strings - or make small changes to implement your own data load patterns.

## Title: Data Storytelling Using Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
In today's world, data is omnipresent and most organizations are presented with billions of data points every morning. Good analysis parses these numerical outputs into an understanding of the organization or process. In short, it “humanizes” the data by turning raw numbers into a story about the performance. The challenge is to interpret these stories correctly and for that, we need the help of data visualization tools like Microsoft Power BI. 

Join me as I take you through on how to utilize Power BI effectively to tell data stories and engage your audience. Watch and learn some of the top techniques and hacks on making aesthetic as well as relevant Power BI reports for effective storytelling. Also, watch out for some engaging examples of storytelling using Power BI (which also includes the winning report of the Microsoft Power BI Best Report contest!)

## Title: Incrementally Moving to the Cloud Using Biml
 
**Abstract**:
Many organizations are interested in the cost savings, ease of maintenance, and other benefits of hosting data solutions on Microsoft Azure.  For most, moving to the cloud is easier said than done, especially when they have a large existing solution that is being actively used by stakeholders.

In this session, we will examine various strategies for incrementally moving your solution to the cloud. This will include strategies that incorporate the use of:
1) New value-added features and services, such as machine learning and big data
2) Hybrid approaches where portions of your existing solutions can be moved to the cloud without requiring everything to be moved
3) Failover and surge approaches that enable the cloud to supplement on premises resources
4) and much more

Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) will be central to our approach, enabling the rapid movement of assets back and forth between on premises and cloud hosting.

All code will be shared with attendees.

## Title: Are You Making False Assumptions about Your Data?
 
**Abstract**:
When starting on a new data project, the first step is usually to interview stakeholders and subject matter experts who list the many assumptions that they have been making about the data in the organization. Unfortunately, these assumptions are rarely 100% true which can cause a significant amount of troubleshooting and bug fixing later in the development process.

In this session, we will build a general purpose solution to this problem. Starting from a list of assumptions encoded in an Excel workbook, a collection of SQL statements to test the assumptions are automatically generated. The results of these statements are visualized using PowerBI to create a completely interactive analysis tool to validate assumptions, and diagnose the assumption violations when they are encountered. 

Even better, a solution to automate and orchestrate this entire process using SSIS and Biml will also be presented. All code for the solution will be provide to attendees for free use in their projects.
