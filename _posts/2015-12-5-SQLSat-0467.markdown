## Title: Understanding the Transaction Log, Your Key to Unlocking Greater Throughput
 
**Abstract**:
Does your application suffer from performance problems even though you followed best practices on schema design? Have you looked at your transaction log? 
There's no doubt about it, the transaction log is treated like a poor cousin. The poor thing does not receive much love. The transaction log however is a very essential and misunderstood part of your database. There will be a team of developers creating an absolutely awesome elegant design the likes of which have never been seen before, but the leave the transaction log using default settings. It's as if it doesn't matter, an afterthought, a relic of the platform architecture.
In this session you will learn to appreciate how the transaction log works and how you can improve the performance of your applications by making the right architectural choices.

## Title: Data Warehouse modeling, for data analysis and cubes
 
**Abstract**:
Analysis Services OLAP cubes provide an incredibly powerful platform for the analysis and reporting of complex data. Unfortunately we often find that our source data is not in the right structure to make the best use of the cube’s power. This limits the cube’s functionality, compromises performance and complicates the reports.
In this session we’ll look at a number of different data scenarios that we encounter and explore ways of remodelling the data within the data warehouse to optimize it for cubes and MDX. We’ll see how adding functionality into the ETL layer and data warehouse can have a dramatic effect on the functionality and simplicity of the cube.

## Title: When good SQL design goes bad
 
**Abstract**:
Take what you’ve learned about SQL Server and turn it upside down. 

 In this humorous session I’ll be debating many of the so called "best practices" in SQL Server and demonstrating counter arguments. Come along to see how so called "pillars" of design are starting to break down. 
•When you should NOT use stored procedures.
•When we don’t need indexes.
•When Clustered Tables are bad.
•When Identity Columns should not be Primary Keys.
•When we don’t care about fragmentation.
•When good naming convention’s go bad.
•Why Partitioning often makes your queries slower.
•Why do ORMs really makes sense when they make all your parameters nvarchar (max)

 Health Warning: These may not be the design tips you should be using on your production OLTP.

## Title: Load Testing With SQL Server Tools
 
**Abstract**:
It’s often difficult to know how your SQL Servers will perform under different loads. By performing load testing, we can gain these key insights, perform modifications to existing configurations, and understand the impact on performance levels.

Come learn about the native tools at our disposal for performing these important load tests and how we can identify when performance levels begin to drop. Using demos of these native tools – including Distributed Replay Utility (DRU), Database Tuning Adviser (DTA), Perfmon, Extended Events, and Profiler – we’ll see how to plan and perform a load test project, gain an understanding of SQL Server’s performance under varying load scenarios, and discover which tell-tale indicators can help alert us to performance degradation.

## Title: Do More With Less: Inside SQL Agent Multi-Server Administration
 
**Abstract**:
One of the of the most under-utilized management features of SQL Server is SQL Agent Multi-Server Administration, which allows you to create a SQL Agent job on one server and then deploy it to multiple servers instantly. This allows you to have consistency with your SQL Agent jobs by managing them in a single location. You’ll learn about the benefits, drawbacks, workarounds, and underlying objects behind this technology. You’ll discover how to monitor job execution status and handle the security implications of the master-target relationship. SQL Server MVP Mike Hillwig will show you how to to deploy this simple, yet powerful feature right out of the box without writing a single line of additional code.

## Title: Using Power BI with my DBA Database
 
**Abstract**:
Every good DBA should have a DBA database. A place to store information about all of their instances and databases. They should automatically gather information into that database. They are also often required to query that information to answer questions from other technical teams, Project Managers, Client Account managers, Compliance Teams, Auditors, Directors In this session I will talk about the way that I automate the gathering of this information and also how I use Power BI to be able to allow people to self serve answers to their own questions and remove some load from the DBA team. I am no BI expert so this session is aimed at DBAs who want to be able to show information using the latest tools rather than BI professionals

## Title: SQL Server 2016 - Always Encrypted - secure your data from the prying eye
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will focus on the new feature in SQL Server 2016, Always Encrypted. A new feature that will keep your data encrypted all the way from the database to the application, and only the application consuming the data will be able to see and manipulate the data. Even a DBA in SQL Server management Studio will not be able to see and manipulate the data.

- We will see what is needed to secure the data
- We will build a simple C# program to Consume and manipulate data
- We will see how data looks in the table
- And finally every attendees, should be able to implement this neat feature at their own SQL server 2016

## Title: State-based or migrations-based database development? The pros and cons...
 
**Abstract**:
For the last few years MS have been promoting declarative, state-based database development with tools like SSDT. For many this is the way forward – gone are the days of managing endless upgrade scripts and manual deployments.

At the same time, leaders and shakers of our industry including ThoughtWorks, Pramod Sadalge and Paul Stovell promote an iterative, migration script driven approach asserting that deployment scripts should be tested early and not generated by a tool.

I'm irritated that whenever I go to a “how to do database continuous delivery” session, the speaker invariably believes in one approach or the other and present their way as good and the other as bad. It irritates me so much I want to do something about it.

I’ll discuss scenarios from projects I’ve worked with to explain the pros and cons of each approach. I’ll describe which projects are better suited to state or migrations and I’ll discuss whether it’s possible to get the best of both worlds.

## Title: Dive into SSISDB Catalog using PowerBI
 
**Abstract**:
If you have worked with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) 2012 or above for few years then you already familiar with SSIS Catalog reports. SSISDB Catalog reports - help us to monitor projects, which you've deployed to the server. By using these reports, we can quickly find information related to executions, logging and other interesting things with few mouse clicks.

However, have you ever wondered how to design an SSIS Project so we can take maximum benefit of SSISDB Catalog?  How to troubleshoot SSIS Project executions from the Catalog? How to navigate your way around the built-in catalog reports? How to design a dashboard with SSIDB Catalog data? This session will focus on these scenarios by diving into SSISDB catalog views using PowerBI.

## Title: SSRS - The Dark Side: Custom Rendering
 
**Abstract**:
For those with the time, programming expertise and willingness to get their hands dirty, Microsoft provides a mechanism to write your own custom rendering engine for SSRS in .NET.  Whether you want to create an interactive, self-service dashboard or a mechanism for exporting to Open Document Format, David will talk you through the stages required to write and implement your own renderer.

The first part of this session will focus on how reports are rendered.  David will describe the Report Definition Language Specification and how to access the Report Object Model .NET API.

However, creating an individual custom rendering engine is a mammoth task.  Therefore the second part of of this presentation focuses on how to leverage Microsoft's existing HTML renderer to deliver enhanced reporting capabilities.  By taking a short-cut you will be able deliver some quite impressive new features and breathe life back into those online reports.

## Title: Click  Clone - a simple model for managing data quality and scaling out 
 
**Abstract**:
With retail businesses operating in multiple sales channels, the velocity of sales data and the quality of that data can vary greatly.

This is a key consideration when designing the operational characteristics of your backroom ETL subsystems, that stage and transform sales data into usable FACTs.

Cloning of key tables and utilising a parallel processing ETL stream, enables cookie cutter software development and controlled, synchronised loading of FACTs into the data warehouse presentation layer. The use of dynamically created table clones can reduce database entity clutter, optimise the development and execution of Fact Creation SSIS packages and improve data quality  auditing.

These elements are crucial to scaling out the data warehouse solution as the business grows.

In this session I will review the design, describe the basic components and demonstrate the core functionality.

## Title: What a boozy day at the Guinness factory teaches us about Analytics
 
**Abstract**:
Anyone who can type commands into R but that does not mean that can 'do' statistics for analytics. They may even misuse those methods, and it's an entirely different thing to really understand what’s happening. This is vital, because this knowledge is what really drives each phase of your analysis and create effective models for the business to use in order to create actionable insights. It can be difficult to see when someone is building faulty statistical models, especially when their intentions are good, and their results look pretty! Results are important, and it's down to you to create models that are sound and robust.  

Drinking Guinness is optional, but admittedly might be preferred for this intensive session.

In this session, we will look at modeling techniques in Predictive Analytics using R, using our boozy day at the Guinness factory as a backdrop to understanding why statistical learning is important for analytics today.

## Title: Beware of the Dark Side - A Guided Tour of Oracle for the SQL DBA
 
**Abstract**:
Today, SQL Server DBAs are more than likely at some point in their careers to come across Oracle and Oracle DBAs.To the unwary this can be very daunting and, at first glance, Oracle can look completely different with little obvious similarities to SQL Server.
This talk sets out to explain some of the terminology, the differences and the similarities between Oracle and SQL Server and hopefully make Oracle not look quite so intimidating.

At the end of this session you will have a better understanding of Oracle and the differences between the Oracle RDBMS and SQL Server. 
Although you won’t be ready to be an Oracle DBA it will give you a foundation to build on.

In this precon, we will be looking at the processes involved of taking a simple statement and forming a workable well performing execution plan.

Firstly, we will be looking at Execution plans themselves and picking them apart to describe the physical actions   that are executed by the engine to perform the required statement.  This will be followed by statistics, estimation and caching and the role that they play in forming and costing execution plans. We will see how SQL Server 2014 has new functionality and the problems that they are designed to resolve, we will finish with query optimizer internals.

## Title: SQL Server Backup in the Era of the Cloud
 
**Abstract**:
Backup? Who cares! Now and Then? We store our data in the cloud. Somewhere in the Cloud. Which Cloud? Who cares! But we are still SQL Server Professionals, so... are we need backup? Should we use newest opportunities or old methods? Are we going step further or step back? On my session I will try to find answers for all of those (and more) questions. Demos, cases and examples from world of backup. And of course worst practices.

## Title: SQL Server and Application Security for Developers
 
**Abstract**:
A lot of companies have a philosophy of "ship early with as many features as possible.” Security is an afterthought since it isn't fun to do and no one will attack them anyway. However, the dark side never sleeps, and security breaches have always happened, often leaving companies severely exposed or even bankrupt.
In this session we'll look at a few attack vectors that can be used against your company, and what you as a developer can and should do to protect against them. It will involve a good mix of security conscious SQL Server and application development, because you care about your work and nobody messes with you.

## Title: Maintenance Plans: Planning to Fail
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server MVP Mike Hillwig hates using maintenance plans. He believes they don't scale well and frequently lack flexibility.  Maintenance plans are easy to set up and deploy. Deploying them to many servers is cumbersome. Modifying them on multiple servers at once is an exercise in futility. 

The dirty little secret is that anything you can do with a maintenance plan can be done with T-SQL. And by leveraging several community-based solutions, you can accomplish anything without maintenance plans.

The query optimizer is at the heart of SQLServer.  Without it SQLServer would be a vastly inferior product, queries would have to be manually tuned at each and every turn, and generally speaking, the optimizer protects us from the complexities and mechanics involved.

Much of the optimizer's internal workings are hidden from the user, but can be revealed by using a selection of undocumented trace flags to gain further knowledge and insight into how your queries and data are processed to create a plan.

This session will be a deep dive into the optimizers' internals and not for the feint of heart.

## Title: No stress with OSTRESS, Lessons Learned from a high traffic Replay attempt
 
**Abstract**:
One of my client engagements lately was about replaying a workload. The system had so many batches per second that I couldn't actually do a replay but had to run in stress mode and try to slow down the replay in such a way that it resembled the production system.

I'll show you how to do that amongst a bunch of other things that I learned and would love to share with you.
If you are thinking about using OSTRESS / RML Utilities to analyse your system and stress test it on a different machine to find bottlenecks, then this session is for you.

## Title: Implementing and Maintaining an Azure SQL Database project
 
**Abstract**:
This is an evergreen session, it follows Azure SQL Database evolution and each time is different: it looks at how to implement, maintain and evolve/update solutions developed on Azure SQL Database, through the use of the tools like SQL Sever Management Studio and Visual Studio. Through examples and case studies, will be presented the versatility, power and reliability of the database as a service in the cloud.

## Title: The What, Why and How of Unit Testing SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
We all write SQL scripts but how do we know that what we write is returning the correct results?  In this session I will explain the importance of unit testing your code, what to test for and most importantly what free tools you can use to make this easy.  By the end of this session you will be equipped with the information you need to go and implement unit testing on your code so that you can confidently carry out stress-free system releases.
