## Title: Inside Transactional Replication
 
**Abstract**:
You can probably do a good job in configuring and maintaining transactional replication in your environment. You can get these things done with reasonable quality without knowing how SQL Server does things under the covers. However if you want to take your skills to the next level and troubleshoot complex replication issues, it's crucial to know how transactional replication works internally.

This session will answers questions like; How does the log reader know where to start the scan? How does it add the commands to the Distribution database? How many threads are involved in a replication process? How does distribution agent look for pending transactions to distribute to its subscribers? Knowing all these will help you to manage and troubleshoot the replication very effectively. Come lets learn together!

## Title: Advanced Reporting Techniques  Managing Reports
 
**Abstract**:
Any data that we have today is delivered to end users as reports and dashboards.

=gt; When it is more than 50 reports, 10 departments, 300 users, how to manage the department categories by folders, reports, users, groups  security?
=gt; What are the techniques to implement linked reports, subscriptions, report history, snapshot options?
=gt; How to edit reports using browser based Report Builder and reuse some of the report parts?
=gt; How to build a report that is very simple to use but has advanced capabilities?
=gt; How do I see the subscription information that stores data in XML format within ReportServer database?
=gt; How to take ownership of a deployed report(s) using T-SQL and is it healthy modifying the data using T-SQL directly on the DB?

There are plenty of things that we can do with Reporting services, Report Manager and you can find answers for all above questions in this session.

This session also helps you identify the performance bottleneck in poor performing SSRS solutions.

## Title: “SQL Attack…ed” – SQL Server under attack via SQL Injection
 
**Abstract**:
One of the most often successfully attacked targets is the data that resides in a database server. SQL Server is considered "secure by default", but this is only relevant until the first databases and configurations have been changed. Which is why most of the exploited weaknesses are due to misconfiguration or weak coding practices as opposed to security bugs in SQL Server itself, of which we had the first one since 7 years in 2014.
In this purely demo-based session, I will show several real-life attacks, from mere reading up to disrupting service availability via various types of manual SQL Injection, including a broadly unknown elevation of privileges attack for a non-sa account.
If you have a database-server which is accessible by processes beyond your direct control or that even can be reached by some kind of frontend applications and you are unsure regarding the possible security implications to watch out for, this session is meant for you.

## Title: In-Memory OLTP Vol1 – XTP Fundamentals  Future Development
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2014 introduced a completely new storage engine: XTP (Codename “Hekaton”) which offers so called memory optimized tables + indexes and natively compiled stored procedures. Both features together enable for potentially enormous performance-gains: from 3 up to 30 times compared with standard indexes and standard T-SQL. Of course, practice is somewhat more complex and it is important to understand which workloads truly can benefit from this technology and what migration challenges you may encounter. In this introductory session, enriched with a few demos, I will make sure, that everyone gets a basic understanding of In-Memory OLTP concepts and terminology. Also we will take a first glance on the upcoming SQL Server 2016 developments in In-Memory, which combine the mighty ColumnStore technology for DataWarehousing with XTP under the marketing-term "Real-time Operational Analytics  In-Memory OLTP".

## Title: Visual Analytics and Data Science
 
**Abstract**:
Visual analytics combines automated analysis techniques with interactive visualizations for an effective understanding, reasoning and decision making on the basis of very large and complex datasets”. To enable  data analysts to explore large datasets involving varied data types (for example, multivariate, geospatial, textual, temporal, networked), flexible visual analysis tools must provide appropriate controls for specifying the data and views of interest to selectively visualize the data, to filter out unrelated information to focus on relevant items, and to sort information to expose patterns. Data analysts also need to derive new data from the input data, such as normalized values, statistical summaries, and aggregates. This session will highlight on Microsoft’s Power Query, Power Map to explore relevant data sources.

## Title: Data Insights with Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
If you're trying to make sense of ever-growing piles of data, and you're into data discovery, visualization, and collaboration, get ready for Power BI.  Learn about the tools you need to provide faster data insights to your organization, including Power Query, Power View, and natural language querying.  We also showcase the new PowerBI.com portal, dashboards, and the Power BI Designer.
