##Title: Seamlessly Scaling Azure SQL DB with Elastic Database Tools##
 
**Abstract**:
Elastic Database Tools for Azure SQL DB offers a set of features that make it easier to build and manage a scaled-out data tier for cloud applications. With elastic database tools, applications can easily access data spanning multiple DBs, coordinate management tasks and manage how data is distributed among them. As part of the session, we explore workloads that are a natural fit for Azure SQL DB's elastic database tools. Patterns discussed in depth include multi-tenant applications created by cloud ISVs and SaaS vendors, and applications relying on temporal data distribution. The session will illustrate how easy it is now to build, scale and manage cloud applications in SQL DB when using elastic tools capabilities such as the elastic database client library for .NET.

Inventor, geek, and SQL poet... The most important thing we can learn is how to learn - a huge passion of mine. I want to learn it all, I want to work with others to help eachother in new pursuits. I#39;ve been coding in SQL since MS Access, and a DBA since SLQ2000 came out... and I love it all (except cursors... except in Oracle... argh, it depends!). The life of a DBA is hard to balance, as there is no Active/Active or AlwaysOn for your life.

##Title: Scripting out SQL Server for Documentation and Disaster Recovery##
 
**Abstract**:
Most DBAs need to use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects.
Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exportable and live at the server level, above the database.
Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for moving or recovering a SQL server instance for Disaster Recovery purposes.
Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, and Server Triggers

##Title: TempDB… Do this and don’t do that.##
 
**Abstract**:
There are many rules, suggestions and tips that tell you to do this or don’t do that with TempDB. In this session we will explore the reasons behind many of the recommendations or best practices for TempDB. 
We will start by taking a look at what TempDB is, how it is used, and why this is important to your SQL Server. Next explore why TempDB needs more than one file and how many files TempDB is needed? We will look at why TempDB should be on a different logical drive, even if you are using a SAN. Explore why you should run DBCC CheckDB on my TempDB. Does the auto growth on TempDB really matter, what are these VLFs and how does that impact performance? Take away the knowledge that you need to properly manage TempDB on all your SQL Servers.

##Title: The Art and the Science of Designing a Mission Critical SQL Server Solution##
 
**Abstract**:
When asked to design a critical database system, too many people pick an HA feature and then design the solution around it. This usually results in a costly and disappointing design. This session will show you the five basic archetypes for mission critical database systems and how to select the right features from SQL Server to implement each design. Along the way you’ll hear best practices, tips, and real world advice for features like Availability Groups, clustered instances of SQL Server, as well as the history of some of the more interesting and less often used availability features. While you may not be able to revisit your current designs right away, what you learn will make you the hero of your next mission critical deployment.

Inventor, geek, and SQL poet... The most important thing we can learn is how to learn - a huge passion of mine. I want to learn it all, I want to work with others to help eachother in new pursuits. I#39;ve been coding in SQL since MS Access, and a DBA since SLQ2000 came out... and I love it all (except cursors... except in Oracle... argh, it depends!). The life of a DBA is hard to balance, as there is no Active/Active or AlwaysOn for your life.

##Title: Table Partitioning -Beyond the Basics##
 
**Abstract**:
You've read about table partitioning; you know that partitioning ‘promises’ to solve some performance issues, make backups -and even restores, faster, and, wait, wait, there’s more! Perhaps you have worked through demo code and set up a POC scenario. It looks good, like maybe it would solve some of the problems your organization faces.

But …

You’re just not sure how to pull it off. Sure, the demo code made it seem easy -and it will always be realtively simple for new tables, new data. You have a handle on the ‘basics’. However, your production database has very large tables, hundreds of millions, or even billions, of rows. The SLA does not allow much, if any, downtime.

This session will look at how Table Partitioning can be introduced into existing production environments with little or no downtime And we will explore the ‘real’ performance and maintenance benefits that can be harvested. So, if you want to move beyond the ‘Basics’, don’t miss this session.

##Title: Inside and out of Transactional Replication##
 
**Abstract**:
Transactional replication in SQL Server is great tool for scaling out your application's primary database(s) workload onto other servers with near real-time data propagation. In this session, I will cover data replication tricks-of-the-trade to offload work from your primary database onto other replicated servers. I will show you custom and traditional replication monitoring techniques and performance profiles that you can use to improve your performance and monitoring of your existing replication installations or gain new knowledge and confidence to implement replication for your company. I will also cover how AlwaysOn Availability Groups differs and why I sometimes still choose transactional replication for scaling SQL Server.

##Title: What you're missing out on if you're not using Master Data Services##
 
**Abstract**:
Even if you don’t have a full-fledged Master Data project, there are use cases where SQL Server Master Data Services brings helpful tools to the table. For example, if you have data in Excel that your business wants to manage for compliance and/or wants to integrate, or have a requirement to augment data in a data warehouse dimension (such as adding and maintaining an attribute or grouping that isn’t present in the upstream system), MDS has functionality that can help you solve the problem.

This presentation will outline some of the core MDS functionality and will provide detailed walk-throughs of functionality used to solve business problems using MDS.

I#39;ve been coding in SQL since MS Access, and a DBA since SLQ2000 came out... and I love it all (except cursors... except in Oracle... argh, it depends!).

##Title: Anatomy of an I/O Tuning Exercise##
 
**Abstract**:
Performance troubleshooting doesn't have to be hard, yet getting good at it requires a methodology, practice, and learning a few tools, and a bit about internals.  In this session we'll simulate an I/O bottleneck and walk through the steps required to identify and remediate the problem.  You'll learn how to identify an I/O issue using Wait Stats, Virtual File Stats, and PerfMon.  We'll talk about relevant metrics, how to zero in on a problem, and how a healthy disk I/O subsystem performs.  You’ll return to the office with a suite of tips and tools that will get you on your way to becoming a Performance Tuning Superstar!

##Title: Be Friendly to SQL Server with TSQL Best Practices##
 
**Abstract**:
TSQL is a necessity when interacting with SQL Server so knowing can be half the battle. Performance is always good as the database starts to grow, but building in resilience when you begin is a greater advantage than refactoring. I will go over 5 key things to know when you write TSQL, use DataTypes and/or variables in comparisons and you will also learn about the procedure cache and how to avoid pitfalls there. This is a beginners session but the concepts in this session are a great foundation to begin with. If you are looking for a solid foundation to build on and need the basics to start, this session is definitely for you.

Inventor, geek, and SQL poet... The most important thing we can learn is how to learn - a huge passion of mine. I want to learn it all, I want to work with others to help eachother in new pursuits. I#39;ve been coding in SQL since MS Access, and a DBA since SLQ2000 came out... and I love it all (except cursors... except in Oracle... argh, it depends!). The life of a DBA is hard to balance, as there is no Active/Active or AlwaysOn for your life.

##Title: Life Balance - Sad Realities of Divorce, Optimizations and Being On Call##
 
**Abstract**:
DBAs have a unique job profile that caters to work-life imbalance. How can our spouses expect to be first in our lives when they aren't? At your kid's play and the pager goes off? At Valentine's dinner date and your manager calls? Ever try sleeping through the night during a maintenance weekend? Every one of these is a common occurance that gets interrupted when you are a DBA with on-call duties and they have their consequences. If you are getting in to being a DBA, you need to know what that means to your life, and learn a few techniques to help keep you in balance and not be another burned out techie.

##Title: Introduction to Wait Types and Response Time Analysis##
 
**Abstract**:
Using Wait Types and Response Time Analysis is a proven methodology for tuning SQL Server instances and applications. However, there is often confusion on exactly what the data represents. The issue typically centers around the fact the response time data is analyzed at the wrong level and is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using SQL Server wait types coupled with response time analytics to solve the most difficult performance issues. If you are a DBA or Developer you will definitely benefit from having this methodology in your toolbox.

I#39;ve been coding in SQL since MS Access, and a DBA since SLQ2000 came out... and I love it all (except cursors... except in Oracle... argh, it depends!). The life of a DBA is hard to balance, as there is no Active/Active or AlwaysOn for your life.

##Title: It’s Time for a Change : Temporal Table Support in SQL Server 2016##
 
**Abstract**:
Without temporal tables (AKA history tables), we can only see the current version of data. We can’t see rows that have been deleted or rows as they existed before the latest update. The temporal table support in SQL Server 2016 gives us the ability to create system maintained “history” tables to track all changes to the table data.

In this session we’ll discuss how you can benefit from temporal support in your tables, how to implement temporal tables in SQL Server 2016, and how to write “time travel queries” using the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME clause in a SELECT statement to easily query historical information.

I#39;ve been coding in SQL since MS Access, and a DBA since SLQ2000 came out... and I love it all (except cursors... except in Oracle... argh, it depends!).

##Title: SQL Server Encryption##
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever wanted to know how Transparent Database Encryption (TDE) works or how you set it up? What about encrypting your backups? This session will go over all the steps and caveats that go with this technology. TDE allows you to have your database encrypted on disk and the same Encryption Hierarchy allows you to back up your database and have it encrypt the contents in the backup file.  We will discuss the Encryption Hierarchy which is used for encryption in SQL Server and take you through keeping your secrets safe. Master the concepts of SQL Server Encryption when you are done with this session.

##Title: Moving Beyond Unconscious Bias##
 
**Abstract**:
People love patterns. We simplify our lives by categorizing all day long – things, activities, and even people. Categories let us make sense of a constant bombardment of sensations. But what happens when we unconsciously categorize someone at work? How do these categories box us in? Let’s talk about what we can do to shake up those categories and drive towards a more diverse and productive workplace.

##Title: Query Optimization Statistics – the Driving Force Behind Good Performance##
 
**Abstract**:
When the SQL Server optimizer evaluates a query to determine how best to execute it, the statistics are quite possibly the most important tool at its disposal. But SQL Server statistics objects aren’t perfect because they only contain summary information. In this session, we’ll start with an overview of what the statistics objects are, how the optimizer uses them, and some general guidelines for their maintenance. Then we’ll look at some of the issues – and solutions –  that can arise due to their imperfection: ascending keys, correlated predicates, skewed distribution, or downright bad summary information.

Inventor, geek, and SQL poet... The most important thing we can learn is how to learn - a huge passion of mine. I want to learn it all, I want to work with others to help eachother in new pursuits. I#39;ve been coding in SQL since MS Access, and a DBA since SLQ2000 came out... and I love it all (except cursors... except in Oracle... argh, it depends!). The life of a DBA is hard to balance, as there is no Active/Active or AlwaysOn for your life.

Inventor, geek, and SQL poet... The most important thing we can learn is how to learn - a huge passion of mine. I want to learn it all, I want to work with others to help eachother in new pursuits. I#39;ve been coding in SQL since MS Access, and a DBA since SLQ2000 came out... and I love it all (except cursors... except in Oracle... argh, it depends!). The life of a DBA is hard to balance, as there is no Active/Active or AlwaysOn for your life.
