##Title: Graph Databases with Azure Cosmos DB##
 
**Abstract**:
Graph Database technology is one of the fastest growing fields of database design and evelopment.

In SQL Server 2017 a new option to process Graph Data within the database engine was  added.
This was based around the Cypher Query language from Neo4J

At the same time a Graph Data API was added to Azure Cosmos DB (Microsoft's Globally Distributed Mult-Model cloud databse)
This was built around the Apache TinkerPop graph traversal language, Gremlin

In this Session we will briefly look at use cases for Graph Database and then investigate how these have been implemented in Azure Cosmos DB.

This session is aimed at any developer/architect/DBA that is looking to understand Graph Database and how they have been implemented inside Microsoft's new Cloud based  NoSQL database.

##Title: MS BI + AI experiences: Using PBI, Azure  AML across industries##
 
**Abstract**:
Use case in presentation is from discrete manufacturing (part 2)/ higher education industries, with following summary:

1. The relative ease with which Power BI and SQL Azure can be used and integrated to design and simulate performance of machine elements

2. Power BI and SQL Azure can be used to replace “design handbooks” which typically are paper based or static on a SharePoint – now these can be made “live” by leverage Power BI and SQL Azure

3. Output from physical tests of designs can be analyzed using ML to validate relationships and can be used to predict actual performance

##Title: Tune Like a Guru - The Big Three!##
 
**Abstract**:
EVERY client I engage with is taught to RUN 3 SCRIPTS IMMEDIATELY, WITHOUT THOUGHT AND WITHOUT DELAY as soon as a performance problem is noted. I am exceptionally good at performance tuning and forensics, but I (nor anyone else out there) cannot get at the root cause of a problem without information about the occurrence. These scripts will give you said information (which is very often transient in nature)! I could be putting myself out of work teaching stuff like this! :-D

##Title: Trend Analysis of SQL Server Logs using Powershell!##
 
**Abstract**:
DBAs regularly need to keep an eye on the error logs of all their SQL Servers.When server numbers get large, it becomes very difficult to manage them. If you don't maintaining the error logs, SQL Server will recycle the log and you are going to loose the valuable information. In this session, you will learn how to automatically parse the errors from multiple SQL error logs using PowerShell, store the data in a central location database, and create reports to visualize the information using PowerBI or Splunk.
