##Title: Supercharge Your Maintenance Plans!##
 
**Abstract**:
Today’s SQL Server DBA has a myriad of options when it comes to implementing their backup and maintenance strategies.  From internal maintenance plans to all-encompassing third-party solutions, the options are practically endless.  One very popular solution revolves around a set of free scripts provided by Swedish data scientist, Ola Hallengren.  These well admired scripts are used by corporations large and small worldwide in order to facilitate backups, integrity checks, and index maintenance operations.

In this session, not only will we introduce these scripts to those unfamiliar with them, but just as importantly, we’ll take a detailed look into just how these scripts can be extended and customized even further.  You’ll be amazed at the flexibility offered by the optional parameters.  We’ll also take a gander into the remarkably detailed logging tables in order to inspect the raw data and possibly turn it into a valuable reporting data source.

##Title: Introducing the Limitless DBA-  Copy Data Management, DBA Style##
 
**Abstract**:
Everything in our day to day lives as a DBA is about limits-
•	Limits in space
•	Limits in platform
•	Limits in resources
•	Limits in expertise


This session is about how to remove those limits.  How to provide all the databases you need without having to constantly ask for more disk space.  How to provide a databases as fast as they are needed for new projects, new test cases and new challenges.  How to do more with less time, less people and less hardware and last but not least, how to do all of this without having to become an expert in 20 different languages, products and specialties. 

Join Kellyn Pot’Vin-Gorman as she demonstrates why virtualization is key to empowering the database administrator.  This session will cover how to:
•	Ease patching and upgrading.
•	Offer virtualized environments for every project-  development through production with only a 1/3 or the resources once required.
•	How to change OS and database platforms without losing your mind.

##Title: The Next Frontier-  Opportunities When Migrating to the Cloud with Virtualization##
 
**Abstract**:
Cloud is everywhere and the database administrator is caught in the middle. How do you know where to start and what to migrate first? How do you perform consolidation planning and ensure data security? This session builds on a full demonstration, along with tips and tricks to show how the DBA can secure their environment to allow a self-service option so they no longer are the constraints to projects! The attendee will leave with a clear understanding of:
* Principles of virtualization and why it’s the answer to so many challenges we face today.
* How easy it is to secure data in the cloud using data masking features.
* The ease of connecting to the cloud and migrating environments.
* How to troubleshoot when issues arise and the tools available to diagnose issues.

##Title: T-SQL Performance Guidelines for better DB stress powers##
 
**Abstract**:
To reach your desired business functionalities, it can be easy using some common T-SQL practices like MTVF , scalar functions , Temp tables, Union…etc and they might perform pretty well on development server coz neither adequate stress of users nor adequate volume of data exist there but actually they seem totally strange once going to live where they become performing badly ending up eventually with and sharp skew of performance and standstill cases sometimes , this is due to the lack of stress powers of T-SQL codes which should be considered largely for critical mission DBs in particular more therefore I am going to talk to you about How to capture expensive queries using different techniques ..?and How to optimize them in the shortest time using scientific ways ..? (10 different T-SQL Practices will be explained within this session)

##Title: But I Want it in Excel...##
 
**Abstract**:
As IT professionals we can create reports from SQL using  SSRS, SSMS, Business Objects, Crystal Reports or other popular tools.   How many times have we created something fantastic only to hear the CEO, CFO or sales teams say "That's great... but I want it in Excel".  Ugh!  

Instead of fighting your users, make them your partners!  Save time running reports or making small changes for users... empower the business!  You don't have to do the export-import thing!  Learn some basic techniques to interact directly with SQL to create beautiful Pivot Tables and Graphs, right from Excel.  You can even ensure the CxO will always have fresh data and eliminate sync issues with your other reports.

##Title: Using PowerQuery to track progress in tuning a stored procedure or complex view##
 
**Abstract**:
Tuning a lengthy stored procedure or complex view can be a challenge. Set Statistics IO On, and have fun wading through lengthy output. Use PowerQuery to organize that output for you so you can see where intensive operations are and how your tuning is progressing. 
The focus of this session is PowerQuery, not stored procedures , views or the tuning process. Learn how to read all text files in a folder with PowerQuery, parse the files to retain useful data and then analyze using either Excel or PowerBI. In the process, learn the basics of the PowerQuery Formula Language.

##Title: Artificial Intelligence:Canned  Ready to Consume in MS Cognitive Services##
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft Cognitive Services are a set of APIs, SDKs and services available to developers to make their applications more intelligent, engaging and discoverable. Microsoft Cognitive Services expands on Microsoft’s evolving portfolio of machine learning APIs and enables developers to easily add intelligent features – such as emotion and video detection; facial, speech and vision recognition; and speech and language understanding – into their applications. Joe will be demonstrating a wide variety of the APIs in multiple clients including PowerApps, Flow and Power BI. He will also be discussing what he learned at Build about new and expanded Cognitive APIs launched there.

##Title: Query Store##
 
**Abstract**:
Analyzing query performance can be tricky. It involves knowing several dynamic management views (DMVs) and accessing query plans that are still in the query cache. If you need to get performance metrics for a query which is no longer in the cache, or if your server is restarted it will be an impossible task.
Query Data Store is a new  feature that comes to help DBAs. By persisting query execution data over time, it allows reviewing of statements / plans / properties / statistics.
This session will show you how to enable and use Query Store features, like: obtaining queries with plan changes over time; analyze queries by CPU / Memory / other counters; forcing a plan; and other gems.

##Title: Enabling EDW and BI workloads on Hadoop with Hive / LLAP##
 
**Abstract**:
In its origin, Hadoop was created as a distributed computing system designed to process data in batches, but the many advantages of the platform lead to an immediate desire to run interactive analytical queries against Data Lakes built on Hadoop.  So a few years back the Stinger initiative was created as an ongoing effort to bring interactive SQL querying capabilities to Hive, and its latest release has finally delivered! 
In this session, Luis Figueroa (Solutions Engineer @ Hortonworks) will walk you through the latest advancements that make Hadoop a powerful SQL engine that expands you EDW capabilities with unlimited scale and amazing flexibility. Luis will provide a technical overview of the Hive engine, an update on SQL compatibility with the ANSI standard,  real world use cases and a live demo. If you are a data pro this session is for you!

##Title: How to Manage Many Instances of SQL##
 
**Abstract**:
When managing a single instance it can be fairly easy to keep track of the configuration of that instance, but what about when you have more than 10 instances to manage? How do know they are setup correctly?  How do you maintain the databases on each instance and their configurations? How do take care of patching? In this talk we will answer these questions and more as we discuss best practices and technologies (such as PowerShell and CMS) to help keep your instance configurations in-sync.

##Title: 5 Things To Consider: Stretching Failover Clustered Instances  Availability Groups to Azure##
 
**Abstract**:
Dealing with SQL Server Failover Clustered Instances and Availability Groups for local high availability is already complicated with a lot of the external dependencies such as the network and the Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC.) But it becomes even more complicated when you stretch it out for disaster recovery to Microsoft Azure. In this session, learn the five (5) things that you need to consider when you implement SQL Server Failover Clustered Instances and Availability Group for disaster recovery into Microsoft Azure. We will cover how Active Directory, DNS, WSFC heartbeat and quorum configuration affects deployments of SQL Server Failover Clustered Instances and Availability Group in a disaster recovery site and how to properly configure a client application for connectivity.

##Title: Data Science: From theory to practice##
 
**Abstract**:
Most of us from Engineering background have learnt Statistics to varying degree in college. With the rising popularity of Data Science, there is tremendous opportunity to put the theory to use in various practical applications.

However, if you have not learnt Statistics earlier, this session will provide the basics of some of the concepts and explain how to apply them to solve various business problems. Some of the examples of topics include Regression, Bayesian, Clustering, and Decision Trees. You will also learn techniques to avoid some of the common pitfalls such as Over-fitting the model.

Finally, the session will give you tidbits to explore advanced concepts on your own.

##Title: Who's Afraid of Entity Framework?##
 
**Abstract**:
Do any applications in your environment use SQL written not by a person but by the application itself? No, the system isn't self-aware. Chances are it is using the Microsoft Entity Framework (EF).

EF and other object relational mapping technologies have been a boon for developers. But is EF a technology that developers should even be using? This session reviews what EF is and how it's changed over time. We'll also dive into how it works and what to look for when inspecting a database generated by EF Finally, we'll review EF-generated T-SQL and give some tips on how to improve performance. If you're a data professional who manages databases that are accessed through EF or want a basic knowledge of how EF works, this session is for you.

##Title: On-Demand Creation of Dev/Test/Reporting Databases with SQL Clone##
 
**Abstract**:
Imagine a world where developers and testers could run production-like environments on their own workstations, created on-demand and self-serviced. Raising tickets and waiting hours or days to get operations to deliver test databases would be a thing of the past. 

With Redgate's new tool, SQL Clone, this world now exists. Administrators and developers can create their own database copies in seconds using just MEGABYTES of disk space without ever touching production. Developers can see how their application behaves in a production-scale environment during both development and troubleshooting and operations no longer need to find disk space, provision, etc.

In this session we will examine how SQL Clone uses disk virtualization to enable quick, easy and even automated creation of database copies that are just MB in size.

##Title: PowerShell working with Python and SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
As PowerShell is the main technology for automation in Windows Datacenters Infrastructure, now becomes clear its importance in other non-Windows Operating Systems. The way I see it, Windows Admin has the advantage with PowerShell as the Linux Admin has the upper hand with Bash/PHP/Python. Here’s where we can collaborate and work with each other.

##Title: Know What Your Code is Doing to SQL Server!##
 
**Abstract**:
ORMs - oh how I LOVE them! As a consultant when I see them in play at a client I go KACHIIINNNNGGGG!! :-D Seriously though, they can provide some substantial benefits for coding throughput. But if you don't Read The Fine Manual and do some things right and avoid some major gotchas you will fall prey to one of my favorite Guruisms: "Anything that allows developers to slap code together more quickly is inversely proportional to the performance and scalability you will get from that code"! Although this talk is based on Entity Framework, most ORMs suffer from a lot of the same flaws.

If you have an interest in SQL or any of the Microsoft Data platform technologies, and have learned something useful in your I.T. career, consider giving back to the community by sharing what you know. While it may seem intimidating to give an hour long talk at an event like this, remember that every great speaker had to start somewhere. And for you, maybe that start is here! 
"Do You Think You can Speak" is a friendly competition for anyone, even first time speakers, to share for 5 - 10 minutes on a technical topic, SQL, Business Intelligence, Power BI, or otherwise, that is informative, useful, and entertaining.

##Title: Concurrency Controls and Isolation Levels in SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server determines how multiple processes access the same data simultaneously based on the transaction isolation levels.  Because the locking strategy that the database utilizes to control access to data pages is different between the different isolation level settings, the effects on database performance will also be different.  The right isolation level must be chosen to achieve a good balance between data concurrency and performance.  In this session we will review the isolation level options in SQL Server, their effects on data locks, and performance considerations when running under each of the isolation level.

##Title: How the Grinch Stole SQL Server Performance##
 
**Abstract**:
The SQL Server and Data Access frameworks provide developers a rich set of features that help integrating SQL Server as the system database backend in virtually no time. This simplicity, however, often leads to common database design and code mistakes that introduce severe performance issues later when systems work under the heavy load. 

This session shows several common mistakes and inefficiencies that can be found in many production systems such as excessive code reuse in the database using the views and multi-statement functions and in the data access code; unnecessary joins and I/O operations in pagination queries; storage of multiple entities in the same tables using XML for entities-specific attributes; usage of the optional parameters in the where clause of the queries; and several others. The session explains the root-cause of performance issues those mistakes introduce and demonstrates how to properly address them in the code and database design.

##Title: Lightweight geo-replication for SQL Server using the Azure Service Bus##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session I will provide an overview of the Azure Service Bus and how to use it directly from SQL Server to send messages between multiple SQL Server databases across the globe. Sending messages to a service allows database administrators to replicate data from one database to another, or to multiple databases using a subscription model. This demo introduces a technology called Enzo Unified to allow direct connectivity to the cloud from SQL Server databases.

##Title: Devops  Continuous Release for the DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
I've been working on a DevOps team for more than year. Join me as I talk about culture, tools, and processes that are all part of the journey to continuous release.  My goal is to get you thinking about how your job as DBA or database developer changes when you're part of a team that is striving to release faster. Part of that will be sharing the tool stack I use right now and why, and some of the many challenges I've hit so far.

##Title: Practical Uses for SQL Server 2016 Dynamic Data Masking##
 
**Abstract**:
Dynamic Data Masking (DDM) allows database administrators to obfuscate data columns containing sensitive data from unauthorized users without changing the data stored in the database.  This new features has some limitations that prevent it from being used as the only mechanism for securing sensitive data, but it does provide additional flexibility to administrators, developers, and support personnel on querying sensitive data and maintaining compliance.  In this session we will explore how to set up Dynamic Data Masking for use in production support and for generating production-like test data.

Working as a Senior Database Administrator, I get to work in a SQL 2016 environment.

My daily tasks are both Development and Operational, so I'm doing  a huge amount of development, lots of ETL's and automation in SSIS, SSAS administration and  debugging issues; I build Powershell scripts to scan and identify/solve problems, and support our ESX servers as an admin in our VMware/VShpere envireonment.
