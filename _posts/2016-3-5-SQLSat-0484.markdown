##Title: Turbo-Charged Transaction Logs##
 
**Abstract**:
The transaction log is one of the most critical, yet often misunderstood components of SQL Server. From out of control log growth to very long start-up times, problems with the transaction log can cause a lot of pain. In this session, we'll look at how the transaction log works and how to optimize its performance. You'll learn how to determine the right settings for maximum throughput, and what to do when things get out of control.

##Title: Scripting out SQL Server for Documentation and Disaster Recovery##
 
**Abstract**:
Most DBAs need to use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects.
Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exportable and live at the server level, above the database.
By Learning a little Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for moving or recovering a SQL server instance for Disaster Recovery purposes. Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, and Server Triggers

##Title: Big Data in the Cloud - An Intro to HDInsight and Microsoft Azure##
 
**Abstract**:
BIG DATA!  There, I've said it.  But, what exactly does it mean for YOU?

This session will help to dispel some of the Big Data confusion.  This session will focus on HD Insight, Microsoft's Hadoop based cloud implementation.  Loading data and querying a database is one thing and that will certainly be covered. Exploring how we can integrate data from HD Insight into our existing analytic solutions is one of the real world implementations this session will be focused on.  This is one of the keys to successfully selling management on the needs for a Big Data solution. It's not just another database, it's a tool to enhance existing analytic structures.

During this session, we'll start with a brief overview of Hadoop and HDFS. Next we'll take a look at HDInsight, and explore some of the features therein.

##Title: Becoming the Data Platform Engineer of Tomorrow##
 
**Abstract**:
You're a DBA/Dev/BI Professional (delete as appropriate), what will your role be like in five years time? In this session we will talk about how the industry has changed over the last couple of years and hypothesize on where it is going and the type of work we might be doing and technologies that we will be dealing with.

Will the traditional developer, BI and DBA roles that we know so well today be the same, or will we need to diversify and look at expanding into other areas to stay ahead of the curve?

##Title: Profiler is Dead! Long Live Extended Events!##
 
**Abstract**:
Did you know that Profiler and SQL Trace are deprecated? I know it still works (even in SQL Server 2016 CTP2), but it will never be updated with the latest features. In fact it will never be updated at all! That means if you want to capture information about any new feature, from version SQL Server 2012 and beyond, you need to use another tool. 
That new tool is Extended Events (XE). Not only has it replaced Profiler, and can be used to capture information on all new features, but it is a substantially better tool! 
In this session we will discuss the architecture of Extended Events, how to setup a new trace from scratch or convert an existing Profiler trace, and the new abilities that never existed in Profiler. We will also cover the difference in overhead cost of Profiler and Extended Events.  
Profiler was a friend of mine, but it is time to embrace the new king!

##Title: XML Without Xanax: How to Handle XML in SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you cringe whenever you have to look at an XML document? Does the very thought of XML data living in your database make you scream? Do you have a panic attack any time you have to parse XML? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this session is for you!

We'll start with reasons why having XML in SQL Server might be a good thing, then we'll face our fears and turn tabular data into XML, and finally we'll confront the true source of our anxiety by parsing XML back into tabular data using xQuery.

If you survive this session, you'll have faced your fears about XML in SQL Server, you'll have a solid understanding of creating XML from tabular data, and you'll know how to use xQuery to parse XML.

##Title: Effective Data Visualization: The Ideas of Edward Tufte##
 
**Abstract**:
We spend much of our time collecting and analyzing data. That data is only useful if it can be displayed in a meaningful, understandable way.
Yale professor Edward Tufte presented many ideas on how to effectively present data to an audience or end user.

##Title: How to collect a baseline on all your servers and still get a good night's sleep.##
 
**Abstract**:
Your boss comes up to you and asks you why the system is slow, unless you know how your system is supposed to respond you are stuck scrambling to answer those questions.  With a few free quires and some SSIS magic you can capture a Baseline of your systems.  With this you will be able to know exactly where to look and what might be amiss.  Before you can say what is wrong with your system you need to know how it reacts under normal circumstances.  This session will provide the tools you need to start collection of your systems baselines and give you a great deal of information.

##Title: Wish you could live the glamorous consulting life?##
 
**Abstract**:
Consulting is a great career choice, from the increased pay, (sometimes less), to the flexible hours, (working nights and weekends), you will work with a wide range of customers, (if you can find them), that will lead you to wonder why you didn't start earlier? (and walk away from a cushy job).

I would not trade my consulting career for any other choice, I love the rewards and the freedom it provides me, but I've learned the hard way.
In this session you will learn sales, marketing and management strategies to get your practice off the ground, sand traps to avoid along the way and a honest, down to earth assessment of the consulting life. An essential session for those thinking about this choice and/or those who are just starting out. Y

##Title: Data Pages, Allocation Units, IAM chains... Oh My!##
 
**Abstract**:
Understanding how SQL Server organizes your data under the hood can seem like a daunting task. In this session we’ll take a look at how objects such as tables and indexes are stored in the data file. We’ll also look at how these concepts tie in to your work as a DBA or developer. We’ll see these concepts in action using demos and see how we can use this knowledge to better design solutions.

We’ll start off by looking at the structure of a row and then move on the concept of a data page. From there we’ll cover a few special page types like the index allocation map. Then we’ll look at index structures and talk about the differences between heaps and clustered indexes.

##Title: Infrastructure for the DBA: An Introduction##
 
**Abstract**:
It doesn’t matter if you are a Junior DBA, an accidental DBA or all the way up to a Senior DBA, the infrastructure your SQL Server environment runs on is important.  Many among the DBA community came in as developers or perhaps directly into database administration roles it is equally possible that you have been out of the operations world long enough to have fallen out of the loop with what is happening.  This session is intended to provide a full stack infrastructure overview so that you can talk shop with your cohorts in operations to resolve issues and maybe even be proactive.  We will discuss, in an introductory fashion, hardware, network, storage, virtualization and operating system layers.  Additionally, some suggestions as to where to find more information will be provided.

##Title: Lock, Block and Two Smoking Barrels##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a high performance relational engine and provides a highly scalable database platform but due to its complexity (and bad programming practices) can be prone to serious concurrency problems, unexpected behaviors, lost updates and much more!
In SQL Server 2005, two optimistic concurrency mechanisms were introduced and touted as the solution to all our problems. Now in SQL Server 2012, 2014 and 2016 even more have followed, but many challenges and problems still remain.
Let’s take a long look into the world of SQL Server concurrency and investigate Pessimistic and Optimistic isolation understanding how they work, when you should use them, and more importantly when they can go very wrong. Don't be staring down the wrong end of SQL Server's two Smoking Barrels and join me for this revealing and thought provoking presentation.

##Title: Big Data in the Modern Data Warehouse##
 
**Abstract**:
'Big Data' has been the buzzword of the past few years. With the exception of a few niche verticals and use cases, it's often been a solution in search of a problem, as well as a word in search of a definition. With decision makers excited to push big data and predictive analytics solutions within organizations, data architects and developers must quickly understand its strengths within an enterprise BI architecture.

This session aims to define big data from the perspective of the enterprise data warehouse, while also arguing that both big data and data warehouses compliment one another perfectly. By using Google's big data analytics platform (BigQuery), SSIS, and a data warehouse built in SQL Server, we will illustrate how big data can best serve your organization, while also combining cloud and on-premise solutions across competing technology platforms.

##Title: Virtual SQL Servers, Actual Performance##
 
**Abstract**:
Virtualizing your business-critical SQL Servers should not imply that they will run slower than if they were physical. When properly architected and managed, virtual SQL Servers should be equally as fast as their physical counterparts, if not faster. However, if not properly constructed, silent and seemingly random performance killers can strike and significantly hurt your database performance. 

This session is packed with many tips and tricks for getting the most performance from your virtual SQL Servers. The major roadblocks to performance are discussed, and the knowledge gained can help you work with your infrastructure engineers so that you can optimize the system stack for performance. Tools, techniques, and processes are demonstrated to help you measure and validate the system performance of the key components underneath your data.

##Title: Clusters! From the ground up, let's build one together##
 
**Abstract**:
You're looking to protect your SQL instance from a machine failure.  Or maybe your storage budget and tight and you don't want to have your databases in two places with one of the other highly available options that SQL provides.  Let's learn what a cluster is and why it might be the right thing for you.  We'll explore the system, network, storage and database administration sides of the equation.  And, when it's all said and done we'll even have built a SQL clustered instance!

##Title: Much Ado About Hadoop##
 
**Abstract**:
Hadoop is a hot topic right now, and Microsoft is betting that Hadoop and SQL Server will go together like peanut butter and chocolate.  This presentation will spend a little bit of time on the theory behind Hadoop, but the rest will be a demo-driven look at how to get a handle on Hadoop before somebody introduces it into your enterprise.

##Title: Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures, filled with table variables, instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cut that work from hours or days to minutes or even seconds. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. Learn:
• The most useful regular expression commands
• The appropriate times to use regular expressions
• How to use regular expressions to write code for you
• How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods

##Title: Anatomy of an Optimizer##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, we look in depth at how the query processor architecture and show what operations it performs during query optimization to generate equivalent query plans and find a “good enough” plan with limited time during query optimization, explain query optimization phases and show a few DMVs that are useful when diagnosing optimizer behavior
We will also explore the differences between In-Memory OLTP tables vs Disk based tables, and have a look at some considerations when you use the new cardinality estimator
We explain why query optimization complexity increases exponentially with the number of tables included in the plan, and how to diagnose and remedy issues that relate to bad query plans

##Title: Azure SQL Database for the Earthed DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
Everyone knows that Azure SQL Database only supports a small subset of SQL Server functionality, small databases, and has really bad performance. Except, everyone is wrong. In fact, Azure SQL Server Database is ready to support many, if not most, databases within your enterprise. This session reintroduces Azure SQL Database and shows the high degree of functionality and improved performance that is now available. You’ll leave this session with a more thorough understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of Azure SQL Database so that you can make a more informed choice over when or if you should use it within your environment.

##Title: "R" You Ready For SQL 2016?##
 
**Abstract**:
R is one of the fastest growing programming languages, useful for data analysis and visualization. You've been able to connect to SQL databases to work with large data sets before using R packages. But now, with the upcoming SQL 2016 release, R will be included as an Advanced Analytics Extension. You'll be able to run the same R scripts right in your database. 

In this beginner session we will look at how to set up R on your SQL instance. We'll work with some sample data to show how R works with SQL inside and outside the database with some basic R commands. And we'll create some graphs and charts for use in some SSRS reports.

##Title: Dammit Jim! Dr McCoy’s Field Guide to system_health (and the default trace)##
 
**Abstract**:
As DBAs, we are asked all sorts of impossible questions.  Who dropped that important table last month?  Why was everything slow last week?  Who made that user a sysadmin?  You’d have to be a mind reader to know the answers to some of those, right?  Not necessarily!  SQL Server can help you find information about these and other common problems with its default trace and system_health Extended Events session, but you have to know how to collect and interpret the data they provide.  In this session, we’ll explore what system_health and the default trace are, what information they contain, and how to use them to find the answers you’re searching for.

##Title: Context  Calculation, Back to the Basics with DAX##
 
**Abstract**:
The learning curve for DAX isn't a straight line - it starts off gradual and quickly gets steep.  With a syntax similar to Excel, DAX seems easy enough for an Excel power user but things quickly get confusing without a good foundation in the basics of DAX.  Those basics - context and calculation - are the topic for this session.

This session is for the intermediate DAX user who has produced some quality data models and DAX calculations but who is still having difficulties with functions around filtering, time intelligence, and complex calculations.  We'll go through a number of practical examples that show that DAX at a fundamental level is a combination of creating filter and row CONTEXTS and then using those contexts to produce CALCULATIONS.  Understanding this concept is a must to produce more complex code in DAX and it's also a very useful framework for someone just getting started.

##Title: Time to Stretch: Scaling out with Azure DB Elastic Scale##
 
**Abstract**:
Elasticity is one of the main promises of cloud computing. The cloud has given us the ability to programmatically add or remove resources to an application and dynamically respond to our workload volume to allow for cost efficient, high performing solutions. However, achieving this elasticity in a transparent way can be a challenge in itself.

In particular, dynamically scaling the database tier can be difficult due to having to deal with distribution schemes, data movement, application routing and the actual increase or decrease of the database resources. Azure SQL Database and the Elastic Scale .NET API combine to provide a solution to these challenges in an easy to use but powerful set of capabilities. 

In this session we will demo the elastic scale API, elastic db pools, elastic query and elastic database jobs and how they combine to bring database elasticity in your own application and take advantage of true cloud optimized infrastructure!

##Title: Biml for Beginners: Speed up your SSIS development##
 
**Abstract**:
SSIS is a powerful tool for extracting, transforming and loading data, but creating and maintaining a large number of SSIS packages can be both tedious and time-consuming. Even if you use templates and follow best practices you often have to repeat the same steps over and over and over again. Handling metadata and schema changes is a manual process, and there are no easy ways to implement new requirements in multiple packages at the same time.

It is time to bring the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) software engineering principle to SSIS projects. First learn how to use Biml and BimlScript to generate SSIS packages from database metadata and implement changes in all packages with just a few clicks. Then take the DRY principle one step further and learn how to update all packages in multiple projects by separating and reusing common code. 

Speed up your SSIS development by using Biml and BimlScript, and see how you can complete in a day what once took more than a week!

##Title: Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!##
 
**Abstract**:
Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!

##Title: Data Architecture 101##
 
**Abstract**:
This presentation is a quick introduction for the DBA or developer who was just told that their boss promised a major new customer a scalable, well designed database. The customer will pay a lot of cash and years of ongoing business using this database… If you deliver it this week!

You’ll get a big bonus if you build this right, but you also remember what your co-workers did to the person who bungled the last database design… and wonder if that designer ever recovered! This session will introduce you to the fundamentals of Datatypes, Relational Algebra, and Normalization to help you avoid the major pitfalls and maybe get some sleep too!

This presentation is a survey of Data Architecture for the Intermediate DBA, it is not intended for experienced Data Modelers.

##Title: Introduction to Window Functions##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2005 and later versions introduced several T-SQL features that are like power tools in the hands of T-SQL developers. If you aren’t using these features, you’re probably writing code that doesn’t perform as well as it could. 

This session will teach you how to avoid cursor solutions, and create simpler code by using the window functions that have been introduced between 2005 and 2012. You'll learn how to use the new functions and how to apply them to several design patterns that are commonly found in the real world.

##Title: Workload Replay: Synthetic vs Real-World Benchmarking##
 
**Abstract**:
How much do you really understand how your workload changes based on the time of day, background processing, user load, or which application module is in use? There's no better way to understand your workload than to benchmark and replay it. This will help you mitigate risk in production before making changes, allow you to find and improve bottlenecks in your code or infrastructure. In this session, you will learn the process of using both synthetic (when applicable) and real-world capture tools to test your environment to make you look like a rockstar.

##Title: Top 10 Clustering Dos and Don'ts##
 
**Abstract**:
Clustering SQL Server still vexes many in one way or another. For some, it is even worse now that both AlwaysOn features - clustered instances (FCIs) and availability groups (AGs) - require an underlying Windows Server failover cluster. Storage, networking, Active Directory quorum, and more are topics that come up quite often. Learn from one of the world's experts on clustering SQL Server some the most important items - both good and bad - that you need to do to be successful whether you are creating an FCI, AG, or combining both together in one solution.

##Title: What is a Latch, and Why Do I Care?##
 
**Abstract**:
Latching is a necessary function of the database engine. Although latching is a topic is normally presented only in expert-level sessions, a good grasp of the problems excessive latching exposes is important even for novice tuners. This session focuses on the PAGELATCH_* and PAGEIOLATCH_* wait types, explaining what is happening, why it is happening, and how to use the exposed information to tune queries and solve performance problems. If you've seen these wait types in Activity Monitor and wonder what they meant, then this session is for you!

##Title: Spatial Data - Looking Outside the Map##
 
**Abstract**:
I've said it before and I'll say it again, spatial data doesn't get much love in SQL Server.  It is a feature worthy of much appreciation and will become more vital as more location data is collected.  In this session we will explore spatial data and discover many ways it can be used for incredible analytics.  You will learn some new ways to visualize your data outside of the typical plots on a Bing map layer.  Come and learn how powerful spatial data can be even though it lacks a snazzy "power" title.

##Title: Teaching Your Servers to Call For Help##
 
**Abstract**:
DBAs need to regularly monitor their servers for a regular health check. Running the daily checklist becomes tedious and requires a lot of time. In this session, SQL Server MVP Mike Hillwig will teach you his signature "See Something, Say Something" method. You'll learn how to use the SQL Agent to turn the daily checklist into actionable alerts. By leveraging the SQL Agent severity alerts and some basic scripting techniques, you'll stop mindlessly going down a checklist and instead have your servers tell you when there is a problem. 
 
**Speaker(s):**
- Mike Hillwig
 
*Track and Room*: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment - Room 208

We spend a lot of time thinking about how to write efficient code, but we don't spend a lot of time thinking about how to be efficient at writing code. In this session I will show you some lesser known keyboard shortcuts, tips, tricks, and hacks that will make your day easier. These are the tricks I've picked up over the years that help me get my work done quicker and easier.

##Title: Designing SQL Server HA/DR Infrastructure to meet the SLA##
 
**Abstract**:
Once you agreed to an SLA for the databases you manage its time to deliver on this promise
This session will show how to select from the many HA/DR features you have in SQL Server to pick the ones that will help you meet the SLA and most important will tell you how you must combine them to be successful.
For each one of the solutions we discuss we will define a series of failure modes and then check if the solution actually can fulfill the SLA as promised or if it needs more

##Title: IO Whack-a-Mole##
 
**Abstract**:
Disk IO for a virtualized SQL Server database takes a mysterious journey. In this session we will take the mystery out of virtual disk IO. Using common infrastructure tools we will explore the path of a disk IO and share repeatable methods that can be used to quickly identify the cause of a performance bottleneck. Along the way we will explore SQL Server, the Virtual Machine, the hypervisor, virtual switches, physical switches, and the storage.

##Title: Effortless Backups with Minion Backup##
 
**Abstract**:
Let's take the new, free backup tool out for a spin. We can hop through a quick installation, glance at the multi-install PowerShell script, and dance around the table-based schedules, for a start. Afterward we'll have a long, leisurely walk through some of the best things you can do with MB: backup ordering, pre- and postcode, live insight, striping and mirroring, and of course so much more. Feel free to download MB and follow along on your own laptop!

##Title: Power BI  - Explore SQL Server Database and Performance Metrics##
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI is a powerful analytics tool. It allows users to easily shape and transform their data into actionable insights in a very short period of time. We’ll explore how the tool can connect to your SQL Server database and allow you to visualize Database and Performance Metrics, such as, file size, Buffer Pool and Plan Cache, Wait Stats and more. We will create visualizations and reports in Power BI Desktop using SQL queries, publish that information to the Power BI Service, and walk through sharing and mobile consumption. The goal of this session is to provide you with a better understanding of how to leverage Power BI for yourself and your organization.

##Title: Are You Optimistic About Concurrency?##
 
**Abstract**:
What exactly does it mean to have optimistic concurrency? What is the alternative? Is SQL Server 2012's SNAPSHOT Isolation optimistic? How can SQL Server 2014’s In-Memory OLTP provide truly optimistic concurrency? In this session, we’ll look at what guarantees the various isolation levels provide, the difference between pessimistic and optimistic concurrency, and the new data structures in SQL Server 2014 that allow the enormous benefits of having totally in-memory storage with no waiting!
