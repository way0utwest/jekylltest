##Title: (SSIS, TSQL) - Record Linkage(Fuzzy Match) ##
 
**Abstract**:
We will implement several code samples based on a series of articles amd posts identifying similar records between two different sources or grouping of records from a single source, based on existing column string of values. We will define an approach, review actual implementations with various SQL tools(TSQL, VB,SSS). Although we are discussing matching, we need to address several steps prior to getting to the actual use of matching algorithms.The steps are as follows: 1. Cleansing and standardization 2. Group records 3. Split records 4. Compare records and determine scores 5. Split into separate match categories 6. Analyze results of matches 7. Evaluate using match tools to determine if best algorithms have been combined.

##Title: Test Driven Development in SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
In the words of Brent Ozar (www.BrentOzar.com), "You can't be a great SQL developer without using Test Driven Development.  In the words of Grant Fritchey (www.ScaryDBA.com), "Test Driven Development with SQL Server made me want to tear my hair out."  Testing in T-SQL may be more cumbersome than in other development languages, but eventually all software must be tested.  How can you thoroughly test a data-dependent application without testing the data pieces that drive the application components?  If the database has problems, they will eventually affect the rest of the application.  This session explores the basics of Test-Driven Development:  unit tests; setting up test data; and automating your tests.

##Title: Partitioned Tables: Management  Query Processing##
 
**Abstract**:
You are implementing partitioning because you want easier management for very large tables and indexes and want to improve your data loading, deletion and archival operations. But you also need to know the query processing implications and understand how partitioning will impact your existing queries. On the other side, many developers believe that the primary purpose of partitioning is to make your queries run faster. This session will show you the reality and will focus on both how to implement partitioning to achieve better maintenance and data availability and how it will impact query processing, including potential issues, benefits and recommendations.

##Title: Become Bilingual! Oracle for the SQL Server DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
In today's enterprise environments, it is becoming increasingly necessary to integrate data from a variety of sources. As SQL Server continues its march into the enterprise, the days of focusing 100% on one platform are over. At a bare minimum, we need to be able to communicate with DBA's for other platforms. Terminology as simple as Instance and Database mean very different things in Oracle than they do in SQL Server. In this session, we will compare and contrast the two platforms in terms of features and terminology. We will also discuss some of the best practices and pitfalls when integrating the two.

##Title: Help Desk to DBA in 60 Minutes##
 
**Abstract**:
Most accidental DBAs’ start their foray in to database administration in a similar way.  You start with little knowledge of SQL server and maybe even little knowledge of system administration basics at all.  I will share some tips and tricks that I have picked up over the years to help you get on your feet as a DBA, by showing you how to find out where your instances of SQL are, what business processes depend on them, what their current states are and how to learn the skills you need to keep your databases safe and available.

##Title: Visual Studio 2010 Database Projects##
 
**Abstract**:
Managing DDL scripts has always been one of the biggest challenges facing Database Developers. How do you keep your Development, Test, Stage, and Production Environments in sync? Why aren't databases tightly integrated into source control systems like application code is? Visual Studio 2010 Database projects solve all these problems and more. In this session, we will learn how to use Visual Studio to treat database objects as the first-class citizens they have always been.

##Title: Designing Re-Startable SSIS Packages##
 
**Abstract**:
SSIS provides the Checkpoint functionality for recovery after a package failure, but many experienced SSIS developers eschew it because of its lack of granularity when restarting a failed package. Sometimes the restarted package will execute tasks that had partially succeeded previously, causing data consistency issues or outright data destruction! In this session, you will see SSIS package design that allows predictable, scalable recovery after a partial or complete failure during execution. Intended for experienced SSIS developers with knowledge of SSIS Expressions and T-SQL.

##Title: Top Query Optimizer Topics for Better Performance##
 
**Abstract**:
This session will show you how a better understanding of how the Query Optimizer works can help you to improve the performance of your queries. I will show you the top 10 Query Optimizer topics that can give you the most benefit by focusing both on concepts and practical solutions. Several areas of the query processor will be covered, everything from troubleshooting query performance problems and identifying what information the Query Optimizer needs to do a better job to the extreme cases where, because of the its limitations, the Query Optimizer may not give you a good plan and you may need to take a different approach.

##Title: Access with SQL Server Express - Perfect!##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Express was the best thing to ever happen to Microsoft Access, it provides security, multi-user service, and processing power beyond what Jet could ever provide. Now you can migrate small databases to a environment that can meet corporate IT policies and enjoy it without paying for a server license. We will discuss migration strategies to SQL Server Express, backup and maintenance, and optimizing the relationship between the two. We will also cover avoiding road blocks and what every SQL Server table should have when working with Access.

##Title: Building nTier Applications with Entity Framework##
 
**Abstract**:
Learn how to build real world nTier applications with the Entity Framework and related services. With this new technology built into .NET, you can easily wrap an object model around your database and have all the data access automatically generated or use your own stored procedures and views. Then learn how to easily and securely expose your object model using WCF with just a few line of code using ADO.NET Data Services. The session will demonstrate how to create and consume these new technologies from the ground up.

##Title: Parallel Data Warehouse - Architecture Overview##
 
**Abstract**:
In Nov.2010, Microsoft officially released SQL Server 2008 R2 PDW Edition. Parallel Data Warehouse is a true MPP (massive parallel processing) platform featuring an ultra shared nothing architecture. PDW is capable of delivering very fast query performance and can house up to 500 TB of data. This session will overview both the HW and SW architecture of the PDW appliance. It will explain how Microsoft and HP have engineered a solution using commodity HW and SW that can compete with more expensive platforms like TeraData and ExaData. Additionally, SQL DBAs will see where their current skillset is applicable to managing a PDW appliance.

##Title: MS Access with SQL Server Strategies and Tips##
 
**Abstract**:
Access can be a rapid development UI for small SQL Server databases, saving you time and money over .Net, IF you follow the right strategies and avoid the pitfalls. We will discuss how to fine tune the relationship between the two, strategies on importing data, how to minimize connections to SQL Server and touch on Access Data Projects. We will also discuss where Access as the presentation layer makes sense and DBA strategies in working with Access developers. At the end you will walk away with a better sense of managing the Access/SQL Server relationship.

##Title: Virtualization Basics for the SQL Guru##
 
**Abstract**:
This session will cover Microsoft Virtualization technologies in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 (Hyper-V). I will cover how to use the tools in both environments to create and manage Virtual Machines (VMs) and explain when to use Windows 7 versus Server 2008 R2. Lastly, I will show how to configure your system for multi-boot using Boot to VHD. If you have a USB hard drive with 10 GB of free space, I will also give you an unactivated VHD with Server 2008 R2 installed and ready to go with Hyper-V.
