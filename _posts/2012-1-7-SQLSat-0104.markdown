## Title: Devs are from Mars, Report Servers are from Venus
 
**Abstract**:
Do you remember what it was like to fall in love? Wasn't it wonderful? 

Lately it hasn't been the same. There's no spark anymore. You've been stuck doing the same old charts and tables. Maybe Reporting Services won't tell you what's wrong, and you're even thinking about seeing other reporting products.

In this session, Doug will re-ignite your passion for RS by reminding you how reports perform best, what RS has been trying to tell you (but you haven't been listening), and show you some new -- and easy -- tricks you may not have known RS can do. You'll leave knowing more about troubleshooting with the execution log views, understanding how to design reports for high performance, how to deal with blank pages, and more.

## Title: SQL Azure: Future-Proofing Your SQL Career
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Azure's not just coming; it's here. In your role as the local expert on all-things-SQL-Server, you will need to know how to talk intelligently about it. You may also want to be able to whip up an impromptu SQL Azure demo for co-workers and decision makers. This demo-heavy session will help get you to that point.

We'll look at what kind of usage scenarios work best for SQL Azure. We'll look at what SQL Azure does, and what it doesn't do. We walk through the process of creating, loading and querying databases, at what management tools are available, and how you will create and manage your account. We'll explore what cost-efficient ways there are for an individual to get access, and how to monitor the costs on an ongoing basis.

## Title: The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects
 
**Abstract**:
Taking the periodic table of elements into consideration I've created The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects as a reference tool for these functions and views that have become so critical for today's SQL Server DBA to performance tune and gain metadata insights into their various SQL instances. In navigating the table we will examine key DMVs and DMFs of interest: requests, sessions, wait stats, indexes, system information will all be covered. We will also delve into how these DMOs - just like their elemental counterparts - can be combined to yeild interesting insights into your servers. We will also look at how things can go awry as well! Like mixing vinegar and baking soda, sometimes combining DMOs can cause a big mess too!

## Title: Edge Case Testing for the Database Professional
 
**Abstract**:
Are you confident that your application performs as expected on Leap Day?  Do you know how long it would take to run out of identity values in your major tables?  Can you support case-sensitive collations and non-standard sort orders?  If not, odds are good that you are not edge and corner testing your application.  In this session, learn how to define the edges of your application and start to stretch those boundaries by setting up challenging test and development environments.  For database administrators, learn what configurations in your environment may be a source of bugs in application code and what you can do about it.  Learn about edge cases that you can start hardening your code against on Monday morning!

**Abstract**:
Life is all about choices, and when it comes to SQL Server it is no different. If you don't have a methodology for researching questions and resolving issues then you need to get one, and soon.

## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs
 
**Abstract**:
If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

## Title: 7 Ways to Fix Bad Parameter Sniffing
 
**Abstract**:
Parameter sniffing is a misunderstood issue on SQL Server. Most of the time parameter sniffing is helping performance on your servers. But sometimes, circumstances change and what was helping you is now hurting you, bad. In this session we’ll gain an understanding of what exactly parameter sniffing is and why it’s usually so helpful. Then, we’ll explore how parameter sniffing can go wrong and I’ll show you seven different ways you can deal with it when it does. You’ll bring back a wealth of knowledge so that you can identify and resolve bad parameter sniffing in your own environment.

## Title: Discovering the Plan Cache
 
**Abstract**:
Execution plans are stored after execution in the plan cache. This metadata about how queries are executed can provide insight into how your SQL Server environment is functioning. By using XQuery to browse and search the plan cache you can find potential performance issues and opportunities to tune your queries. This information can be used to help reduce issues related to parallelism, shift queries from using scans to using seek operations, or discover exactly which queries are using what indexes. All of this and more is readily available through the plan cache. In this session we will explore the plan cache and start you on the road to discovery.

## Title: ETL as MDM
 
**Abstract**:
Companies store data in multiple diverse formats on multiple databases using multiple versions of software and none of it is designed to integrate of work together… until that it gets to the BI systems. In the BI system data suddenly must – as if by magic - become a fully integrated and logically coherent system to generate reports for executives.  This session will explore the Master Data Management (MDM) default system for many companies, their BI stack and how we can use the ETL process to get a single version of truth for corporate data.

## Title: Development Mise en Place
 
**Abstract**:
Chefs and cooks have a process called mise en place (MEEZ ohn plahs) which translates to "put in place". For cooks this means "organize and prepare" their stations. They have everything they need ready and in the right place. It also means to remove all distractions. 

In this session I will show how developers and DBAs can use this method to better organize their time and efforts to get more done with less rework.

## Title: Predictive Analytics - You Can, Too!
 
**Abstract**:
Predictive analytics is no longer exclusively for those shops that have the resources to design and implement an entire BI architecture. In this session, we will review a class of modeling problems that are not only quite powerful, but are amenable to implementation via relatively simple T-SQL querying. All it takes to get started is the data available in your OLTP system, a basic understanding of the math, and a bit of imagination…

## Title: Eating the Elephant: SQL Server Table Partitioning
 
**Abstract**:
Is your table fat?  Do you need to manage a table that has billions of rows within it and are overwhelmed by index rebuilds that take more than 12 hours?  SQL Server's table partitioning gives the DBA the tools to manage this beast and support very large tables in a way where index management and data retrieval does not become unwieldy.  This presentation will take you step by step through choosing an appropriate partitioning key, setting up the partitioning on the table, and finally maintaining the partitions.

## Title: AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
 
**Abstract**:
In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic ConnectionString fail-over using a real web app to see how well that feature works.

## Title: Your own Private Cloud for SQL
 
**Abstract**:
Can SQL Server be offered as a service (SQLaaS) in your own private cloud?  Can it provide application teams with the ability to easily procure an instance of SQL Server quickly?  You may have some elements of this created in your environment but how do you create the full service offering?  Creating a SQLaaS offering is a lot easier than you think and many companies are now ready for this change.  In this session, you will learn how to design a SQL Server service offering for the Private Cloud that will enable your organization to react faster to the increasing project demands.
