## Title: Power BI Bookmarks: Four Business Use Cases
 
**Abstract**:
So you've gathered the requirements, made sure the ETL is perfect, the model queries in milliseconds, and the report is both functional AND fashionable. There's always that one person(and usually a few) that wants to see the data with a different visual, or with filters applied a certain way. In this session, we will go in depth on the bookmarking feature in a live demo using the framework of four business cases. 

Power BI Pagination
	I'll take an existing dataset previously used for a SSRS report and add Page forward and backward buttons to it in Power BI
Change and Reset ALL filters and slicers
	I'll reset/update filters and slicers across multiple tabs in a report with a single button
Swapping out visuals with one click
	The director wants to see the visual but the VP wants to see the table
Executive Presentation
	Create a finely tuned presentation with nothing but Power BI

Bring your own dataset and build out these scenarios with me as I demonstrate each one live from scratch.

## Title: Ping! (no reply)
 
**Abstract**:
Oh! ASYNC_NETWORK_IO just went through the roof! What just happened?

Ever wonder how common tasks such as how servers communicate, how cross-subnet Availability Group failover to your disaster recovery site work, or why ‘they’ always recommend a dedicated network adapter for your WSFC? What do I need to know to better manage my databases in the cloud? De-mystifying the networking underneath your databases makes you a stronger database professional. This deep dive technical session will cover many of the critical aspects of enterprise-level networking and how your database servers communicate with the rest of the world. Topics and demonstrations include networking technologies, quality of service, VLANs, routing, firewalls, monitoring, and trending.

By the end of this interactive session, you will be able to check your own networks for their performance and know how to converse with the networking admins to help improve the overall performance.

## Title: Zen and the Art of Perfmon 2018
 
**Abstract**:
If your boss asked you for the list of the five most CPU-hungry databases in your environment six months from now for an upcoming licensing review, could you come up with an answer? Performance data can be overwhelming, but you can make sense of the mess. Twisting your brain and looking at the data in different ways can help you identify resource bottlenecks that are limiting your SQL Server performance today. Painting a clear picture of what your servers should be doing can help alert you when something is abnormal. Trending this data over time will help you project how much resource consumption you will have months away. Come learn how to extract meaning from your performance trends and how to use it to proactively manage the resource consumption from your SQL Servers.

## Title: The Fruit Goes Enterprise: Full Stack .NET Development Using Only Mac-Native Tools
 
**Abstract**:
For years, those of us who wanted to use a Mac and do .NET or SQL Server development have been caught in a "worst of both worlds"-type of situation. We have had to use some sort of Windows VM, which negates the relative advantages of using a Mac (notably the battery life).

The good news is that thanks to Microsoft's efforts, we can now do full stack .NET development without ever touching a Windows VM on our Macs! In this talk, I'll live code a simple service with database backend while introducing Mac-native tools such as Visual Studio Code, SQL Operations Studio and SQL Server for Docker. Along the way, I'll discuss key differences and limitations between the Windows tools and their Mac counterparts paying particular attention to the differences between SQL Ops Studio and SSMS. I'll also touch on the difference between Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio for Mac.

## Title: Locking and its effects on queries and maintenance tasks
 
**Abstract**:
Multi-user systems are affected by how SQL Server locks resources to manage concurrent transactions. Understanding how SQL Server uses locks to isolate transactions from one another is important for both writing code and running maintenance tasks. 

In this session, we will discuss lock modes in SQL Server and how they impact your queries. We will show how different isolation levels change which locks are taken and for how long they are held. We will look at ways to avoid unnecessary blocking for maintenance tasks like index rebuilds. Assertions will be backed up with demo-based evidence.

After this session, you will have the understanding you need to start writing application code and maintenance jobs suitable for concurrent systems by anticipating blocking issues due to locking.

## Title: Availability Group Troubleshooting Beyond the Basics
 
**Abstract**:
Your Always On Availability Group just failed. Quick! What do you do? Many of us go straight to the SQL Server log and the Availability Group dashboard. That makes sense - both are great troubleshooting tools, and the answer is often found in one of them. However, they don't always have the answer we seek. What then?

As a consultant, I've been able to troubleshoot a number of less-common scenarios first-hand. Join me as we walk through some of these scenarios to show you how to detect and correct them. Along the way, we'll also discuss alerts you can put into place on your servers to give you immediate feedback when something in your availability group goes wrong.

## Title: Azure Analysis Services: Purpose, Migration, Benefits, and Tools
 
**Abstract**:
This presentation will briefly go over the history of OLAP and Microsoft's contribution to the technology.  
The bulk of the conversation will then be an introduction to Azure's analysis services implementation - how to use it, how much it may cost, a comparison to on-premises implementations, and how to migrate from on-premises.  
Then more intermediate subjects will be discussed, such as analysis of best practices and automation techniques, future features Microsoft is working on, and future research considerations for a more advanced look at Azure Analysis Services.
Demos are included during several parts of the presentation.

## Title: In memory database... Let's rethink that request!
 
**Abstract**:
Many times users or management ask for something that they've heard about but don't quite understand, in hope of solving a problem that doesn't quite make sense. It is possible to put a SQL Server database in memory, and memory is faster than disk, so this has just got to be a good idea!

This session looks at what you can do to put a database in memory, at what problems that can help, and at what problems it won't affect noticeably. It also looks at the recommended way to put tables into memory and the problems that will solve.

## Title: Four Rules For Columnstore Query Performance
 
**Abstract**:
You've read all the Books Online articles about Columnstore indexes for data warehouses, but everything sounds too good to be true. Can you really get the promised 10X query performance without changing any code? In this demo-packed session, you'll learn real world lessons from deploying Columnstore indexes in production, and how you can avoid many query performance issues by following four simple rules. This is an advanced session recommended for attendees who already know the basics of Columnstore technology.

## Title: The Amazing Utility of ROW_NUMBER()
 
**Abstract**:
When it was introduced way back in SQL Server 2005, the lowly ROW_NUMBER() function at first seemed to have little functionality other than simply counting rows.  However, over time we have come to see this humble function is actually surprisingly useful in often unexpected ways.  In this session we will discover the creative uses of ROW_NUMBER() in ways that you may likely not have yet considered.  This session will be filled with little goodies that can you can use, whether you are a writing SQL for application code or for administrative functionality.

## Title: Decoding the Cardinality Estimator to Speed Up Queries
 
**Abstract**:
The cardinality estimator in SQL Server is a massively complex piece of software that is responsible for calculating the estimated number of rows for query plans. We will derive some of the simplest and most important rules for cardinality estimation. Armed with that knowledge, we will address errors in cardinality estimates which can cause poor query performance. Demos include filtering on multiple columns, using local variables, dealing with ascending keys, and more.

## Title: Intro to Powershell for the SQL Server DBA
 
**Abstract**:
Many DBA's have the same outlook on Powershell - we all know we should use it, but we don't think we have time to learn one more tool that isn't even really part of SQL Server anyway.  I was one of these DBA's for many years, but recently I have come to respect the *power* of Powershell.  Come learn the basics of Powershell, how Powershell and SQL Server interact with each other, and finally how to use Powershell to automate common SQL Server tasks such as maintenance and SQL Server installations.  If you need to interact with Windows or Active Directory, odds are Powershell is the right tool for the job - come learn how to use it!

## Title: Introducing dbachecks : Unit testing for your database infrastructure
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever setup a new instance and realized later that you skipped a configuration step? Did you get handed a database from another team and want to see how much work you have to do to clean up it’s configuration? Don’t you wish there was an easy way to validate that every instance in your environment was configured correctly?

In this session we’ll be learning about an exciting new powershell module called dbachecks which seeks to solve these problems. Built upon the backbones of dbatools and pester, this is a unit testing framework with over 100 predefined checks to validate your instances.

## Title: Why Should I Care About ... Partitioned Views?
 
**Abstract**:
Partitioned tables are awesome and partitioned views are dead, right? Well, sure partitioned views are not sexy but there are still plenty of applications where they are critical. And not necessarily just for standard edition who aren't on the new service pack yet. If your data is time stamped, do you see different queries run against older data than new data? Do you with you could segment your data across multiple columns? Do you have data you need to partition horizontally? It's possible partitioned views may still be for you. Come hear why this is still an important topic long after cargo pants and trucker hats went away ... and possibly even after 2016 SP1.

## Title: Plan Cache performance tuning
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, we'll discuss ways to manage execution plans inside the plan cache of busy and unpredictable SQL Servers. The plan cache keeps SQL Server healthy, but all it takes is one bad execution plan to decrease server performance.

Just like gardening, keeping a database healthy requires pruning.  Techniques to manage, remove, and improve execution plans will be shown. The Query Store gives us power tools for this work, but it's not the entire solution.
