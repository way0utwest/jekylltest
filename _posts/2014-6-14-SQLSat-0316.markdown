## Title: (Unusual) Problem solving with SSIS scripts
 
**Abstract**:
Every once in a while a client will have an unusual or obscure requirement that is either very difficult or not possible to satisfy with the out of the box tools provided by SSIS.  
What do you do when your data sources aren’t predictable or in a format not easily read by standard SSIS adapters?
This is when scripting “#8 fencing wire” of SSIS really comes to the fore.
During this session we’ll explore and solve some interesting real life scenarios with SSIS scripts.
