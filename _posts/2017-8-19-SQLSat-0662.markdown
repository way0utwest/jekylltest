## Title: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Automating Your BI Framework
 
**Abstract**:
Quite frankly, some aspects of building out a business intelligence solution are tedious. As you cycle through iterations of your star schema, you’ll find that even a simple data type change in the data warehouse requires you to make corresponding changes to staging tables, and SSIS packages that take a considerable amount of time to implement. But there’s a better, faster way!In this session, we’ll explore lessons from a project that required implementation of a framework to easily generate BI objects based on reusable patterns. We’ll walk through the decision points in the framework design, review the implementation steps, and see demonstrations of how easily you can make iterative changes to your BI solution’s design by using reusable design patterns. Whether you simply want to accelerate change management or reproduce objects in bulk on demand, this session will give you practical tips for automating these processes.

## Title: Where Does R Fit Into Your SQL Server Stack?
 
**Abstract**:
Now that SQL Server 2016 includes support for R in the database, how does this change your BI implementation options?

In this session, we start with a brief introduction to R and explain why it’s increasingly popular, the typical development workflow, which tools you can use, common use cases, and where it fits into the latest Microsoft stack at a high level.

Then we’ll review how to implement R Services so that you can use R with SQL Server data, including how to install R packages on SQL Server, how to use rx functions, and how to operationalize R in SQL Server.

Then we explore options for using R to prepare data for analytics using SSIS or Power BI and how to report and visualize data using SSRS or Power BI.

## Title: Remote SQL Server Troubleshooting and Monitoring Using SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
We have over 3500 remote installations of SQL Server and only 3 DBAs to find and resolve issues. While some installations need daily examination others operate for months without any attention at all.
We needed a system to keep a light, revolving set of data that we could quickly pull back and analyze when issues were escalated to us.
This system also had to be modular so we could add or remove  queries, as needed, while always keeping the data fresh.
In this session I'll use Glenn Berry's diagnostic queries and SSIS to show how we collect and store data on our remote systems. When problems arise we download the data and use Powershell to digest it into a simple report.

## Title: How to Fix Cardinality Estimation Anomalies
 
**Abstract**:
Statistics in SQL Server plays a major role deciding the shape of the Execution Plan. Execution plan, ultimately responsible for the query performance. Filtered statistics is a type of statistics in SQL Server which you can influence the query optimizer by providing more information to it so that query optimizer could produce quality execution plans. Filtered statistics was introduced in SQL Server 2008 but in my opinion, it has not got the attention it needed yet.
In this presentation, I will demo the use of filtered statistics to fix some cardinality estimation anomalies.

## Title: Navigating Modern BI Infrastructure – Power BI Report Server (On-
 
**Abstract**:
Business Intelligence has sat pretty comfortably on the same laurels for well over a decade however that landscape has been disrupted by the surfacing new Azure tools, Power BI, and now Power BI on premise. With so many new tools and features things can get pretty intimidating, especially for those with additional considerations and regulations. It can however open new doors to organizations who were previously unable to fully utilize BI.
 
Through presentation, demo, and open discussion we attempt to navigate classic BI Architecture and the available options there in, as well as touch upon the future of BI and modern architecture.

## Title: Getting Your Story Straight with Data Visualizations
 
**Abstract**:
Having multiple data visualizations doesn't make it easier to choose the right one to reveal the story. Choosing the wrong visualization can obscure the story - or worse yet, distort it! In this session, learn the vocabulary of data visualization and how to apply grammar (visualization design principles) to your data. Along the way, you will also learn how to evaluate the goal of your data story and how to choose the correct visualizations that communicate this story accurately and effectively.

## Title: Statistics and New Cardinality Estimator Model
 
**Abstract**:
Statistics in SQL Server plays a major role creating execution plan which essentially decides server performance. If you get a good execution plan the server performance is good otherwise it will impact negatively on the server performance. SQL Server 2014 introduced new Cardinality Estimation (CE) model to improve the quality of the execution plans via quality estimates of row counts. The new CE model is a major redesign to the Query Optimizer since SQL Server 7.0. In this session, I'm going to talk about how statistics is used to generate the execution plan, how execution plan changes with new CE model with demos.

## Title: Set Me Up: How to Think in Sets
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is optimized to work in sets, but this is certainly a paradigm shift for someone accustomed to row-by-row operations.

We will look at T-SQL features that can break set-based processing -- generally meaning poor performance -- and gather empirical evidence to support that assertion.  We'll also look at some constructs to overcome these issues and make your T-SQL scripts run faster and use fewer resources.

## Title: Visualize Your Transaction Log
 
**Abstract**:
The SQL transaction log can be a mystery to many DBAs.  We live in the age of visualizations, so let's visualize the log!  In this session, we will examine the purpose and organization of the transaction log and will explore the log through a unique visualization tool.  We will consider common performance issues that are related to the logging mechanism and how to overcome these problems.  Finally, we will discuss some techniques to monitor the log so that potential performance problems can be addressed pro-actively.

## Title: Difficult Queries
 
**Abstract**:
Take your T-SQL skills to the next level.  Regardless of your current level there will be something here you'll be glad you didn't miss.  Basics like avoiding cursors in iterative tasks and multi-database executions is the tip of the iceberg.  If queries are basic arithmetic then this is basic algebra.  First we see how coding style affects maintainability then dive into several types of encapsulation, parameterization and more.
