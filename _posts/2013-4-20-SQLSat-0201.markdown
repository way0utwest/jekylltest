## Title: Lean BI Solutions w PowerPivot, Tabular  a Mullet
 
**Abstract**:
Business in the front. Party in the Back. The Mullet strikes a nice balance between "Classy"  "Outlaw".  By applying this model to BI, we'll uncover ways to deliver solutions faster  more efficiently through Lean practices. This session is for anyone who needs to satisfy demanding customers that aren't quite sure what they want, but they need it NOW or they'll lose that critical deal  the world will end!  We'll focus on sequencing deliverables and using PowerPivot prototypes that can be promoted to an AS Tabular model if/when needed.  This process aims to minimize rework while striking a balance between delivering value fast with initial "Cowboy" efforts, and incrementally building a responsible, scalable, maintainable architecture.

## Title: From Impaired To Insightful Geospatial Reporting
 
**Abstract**:
It is expected that business reports be insightful and engaging. Region based reporting can be transformed from boring grids to visually interactive maps. This session will describe how to embark upon self-service and mobile BI solutions that are available within the Microsoft BI stack for analytical geospatial reporting. You will learn the basics of geographical data, including GIS, Longitude-Latitude coordinates and free form text. Using these different data types, we will discuss SSRS 2012, Power View and Excel 2013 tools that can leverage insightful analysis. Finally and most importantly, attending this talk will get you started in learning the essential techniques to deliver geospatial reports that tell meaningful stories for users.

## Title: Hardware 201: Selecting Database Hardware
 
**Abstract**:
The foundation of database performance is the underlying server hardware and storage subsystem. Even the best designed and optimized database application can be crippled by an inadequate hardware and storage infrastructure. Recent advances in new processors and chipsets, along with improvements in magnetic and SSD storage have dramatically changed the evaluation and selection process compared to the past. Many database professionals struggle to keep up with new technology and often simply let someone else make their hardware selection and sizing decisions. Don't let this happen to you! This session covers current and upcoming hardware from both Intel and AMD.

## Title: Taking BI to the Next Level: Collaboration
 
**Abstract**:
Self-service BI is usually an independent activity. But when individuals discover interesting information that they want to share, they need a centralized location to do that. When people work together, new insights are possible, and that’s what collaboration is all about. As more people see the benefits of the solution, they become more likely to use it. As individual products, SQL Server 2008 R2, SharePoint 2010, and Excel 2010 expand your options for enabling BI in your organization, but collectively they create a solid platform for collaborative BI. Knowing which tool to use for which job can be tricky. Come to this session to learn how to use these tools to foster collaboration.

## Title: Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, and
 
**Abstract**:
When a developer goes it alone and works on their own feature of a product, there is always a chance that the feature will never be folded back into the main product, thus never released, effectively wasting that developer’s time.  Continuous Integration means every time a developer writes code, that code is folded back into the main project and tested with all the other code. Continuous Integration means no developer is left behind.  Come to this session to learn how you can make sure all the code your developers have written is used, is effective, and works with all the other code being written. Come learn how to deploy software faster, with higher quality, and with fewer database problems!

## Title: Looney Tuner?  No, there IS a method to my madness
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server query tuning is often more art than science and it can quickly eat up a lot of DBA and/or Developer time. This presentation will outline a method for determining the best approach for tuning queries by utilizing response time analysis and SQL diagramming techniques. Regardless of the complexity of the statement, this quick, systematic approach will lead you down the correct tuning path with no guessing. If you are a beginner or expert, this approach will save you countless hours tuning a query.

## Title: Data Partitioning in VLDB
 
**Abstract**:
Support of the large databases is not a trivial task. Large amount of data negatively impacts system performance and make administration and SLA compliance much more complicated. Data partitioning can help to solve those problems and reduce support and hardware cost. This session demonstrates various approaches of data partitioning available in SQL Server. It compares pros and cons of different partitioning techniques from performance, scalability and administration standpoints. The session also discusses how to reduce hardware cost by implementing tiered storage and demonstrates how to move data between filegroups and/or disk arrays keeping the system online in the different versions and editions of SQL Server.

## Title: Understanding Parameter Sniffing
 
**Abstract**:
Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.

## Title: Dive into the Query Optimizer-Undocumented Insight
 
**Abstract**:
This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.
