##Title: The Data Warehouse of the Future##
 
**Abstract**:
So you think you have the ultimate Data Warehouse...well think again.   The landscape or should I say the data lake is changing constantly.   We are getting data from all over the place.   How do we make it available and relevant for the consumers of a data warehouse.   Is Kimbell obsolete now, what about unstructured data, how about the gazillioin rows of click data, etc.   So the data and BI architects are all on suicide watch.    Well its not really that bad.   Microsoft has woken up and seen all that is going and has brought functionality to SQL Server to solve some of these issues.   This presentation provides an overview of technologies such as Polybase, Temoporal Tables, Columnstore Index, In memory tables, JSON support, etc.   that can be utilized to build the data warehouse of the future.

##Title: Testing SSIS Packages##
 
**Abstract**:
Senior developer: “How do you test your code?” Junior developer: “I compile it.” It’s an old joke, but too often this reflects the reality of testing. If the code compiles, it has passed its test. Sadly, this principle is sometimes applied to Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes as well: “When the SSIS package runs without error, testing is complete.” 

As in software development, testing of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages should not end at when the package executes successfully. You must also confirm that the package does what it was intended to do without placing an undue performance burden on the system.

This session walks through design patterns for testing SSIS packages during and after the development process. The session covers topics such as these:
* Performance testing
* Patterns for validating execution results at runtime
* Validating package metadata before execution
* Design time versus runtime testing
* Making a graceful exit: testing for error

##Title: Unraveling Tangled Code:A Spellbinding Tale of Victory Over Chaos##
 
**Abstract**:
Once upon a time, you inherited an application or a database that was filled with chaos and inconsistencies. The T-SQL code is overly complex and impossible to ken. The architecture is painful to behold, and grueling to code for. One might optimistically say that query performance is “spectacularly mediocre”. If you’re without good documentation or system architects to guide you, how do you break the curse of confusion? In this session you’ll learn several methods for conquering chaotic code, and how to seek and destroy some of the nastier coding mistakes and inefficiencies. We will break complicated queries into key pieces, turn them upside-down, and reform them into something sensible. We will vanquish major issues like data abuse and index negligence. We will restructure joins, tame subqueries, and refactor dynamic SQL. We will emerge victorious!

##Title: Overview of Security Investments in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database##
 
**Abstract**:
Join me for an overview of the most recent security investments for SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database in the areas of encryption, data filtering and data masking. I will showcase a real-life user scenario with examples and demos of Always Encrypted, Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking. The demos include a real working .NET application with source code for testing. This is based on the session and demos I co-presented with Microsoft at SQL Summit 2015 so if you missed Summit or the presentation and are interested in learning what Microsoft is doing in the area of security in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL DB then this is the session for you.

Participants will learn how to: Apply problem solving steps and tools/Analyze information to clearly describe problems/Identify appropriate solutions/ Think creatively and be a contributing member of a problem solving team/ Select the best approach for making decisions/ Create a plan for implementing, evaluating, and following up on decisions/ Avoid common decision-making mistakes

##Title: Beauty and the Bits:  Why both Left and Right Brain MUST be Engaged##
 
**Abstract**:
Whether you plan to run your own consulting business, be a freelancer, or be a healthy part of a software or design team you will need to understand the importance of engaging both your left- and right-brain in the future. Sure, you are smart and you have a good left-brain, but raw processing power, reasoning, and logic are not enough to compete, provide, or even survive in the coming "Conceptual Age." Just as manufacturing automation put much of the "human back" out of business in the Industrial Age, certain forces threaten to put the "human brain" out of business in the age to come. This talk will prepare you for its arrival and insulate you for its duration. Learn how to recognize and utilize the value of well-rounded thinking as you progress throughout your career.

##Title: PowerShell Desired State Configuration from the Trenches##
 
**Abstract**:
There are lots of things to consider when configuring systems in your on-premises datacenters with Desired State Configuration depending on what the state of your current environment is, whether or not DSC will be configured to apply and monitor or apply and autocorrect configuration drift, and whether or not you’ll be using push or pull configuration mode. During this session, PowerShell MVP Mike F Robbins will share his lessons learned while configuring both physical and virtual production systems in multiple datacenters with DSC during a recent hardware and software refresh cycle. We’ll briefly discuss writing configurations, applying configurations via push and pull mode, and we’ll have a quick discussion about DSC resources. You’ll leave this session with the basic concepts of the end-to-end process. Prior experience with PowerShell is recommended.

##Title: SS2014/2016 In-Memory Tables --Formula One Performance Unleashed???##
 
**Abstract**:
Query performance is what it is all about.  SQL Server 2014 now has the new in-memory functionality that takes a completely different approach to data access and manipulation.  This session will consolidate the relevant information from all these sources so the production DBA/Developer will be able to understand, create, use, maintain, and trouble-shoot in-memory table functionality.  This session will also examine several demo scripts showing performance gains using the in-memory tables with and without columnstore indexes over equivalent disk based tables.  
This session is all about when and how to apply in-memory tables in a production environment.
After this session you will
1.	 Understand what in-memory tables are and how to create and maintain them including their limitations
2.	Be able to identify performance gains over equivalent disk back tables
3.	Comprehend the new data monitoring needed for in-memory table

##Title: SQL Anti-Patterns and when it's Okay to be Bad##
 
**Abstract**:
Did I really do that?  If you didn't, you probably will.  And even if you don't ever, it's a good bet that you will still have to deal with others' legacies of Anti-Patterns.  Decades of practice by thousands of software and database developers around the world have produced a large corpus of recognized best practices,  Anti-Patterns are the antithesis of best practice - they are recognized as approaches to be avoided.  SQL databases including SQL Server are no exception.  A number of SQL Anti-Patterns will be described here, along with better practices and exceptions where the Anti-Pattern may actually be a good answer.   This presentation ought to be a spectator's delight - a chance to slow down and admire the train wrecks of others.  For nothing is as instructive as mistakes or as fun to dissect.

##Title: Effective Software Application Logging##
 
**Abstract**:
This session presents an overview of effective methods and strategies for capturing and managing useful information about how your software applications are running, what they are doing (which may or may not be what they are expected to be doing), and most importantly, when, where, and sometimes even why, they are malfunctioning. Software application logging is an often neglected, poorly implemented, and under-appreciated aspect of the software development process. But if implemented wisely, logging can be an invaluable tool for debugging, testing, error handling, and auditing. This session will present a case for a more diligent and rewarding approach to logging, and provide useful tips that can cost very little extra development time, but pay off in the long run, most especially when production issues arise and must be resolved quickly.

##Title: Rx for Demystifying Index Tuning Decisions##
 
**Abstract**:
Indexes are one of the most troubling and mysterious areas for DBAs and developers.  Adding, deleting, or modifying them can yield dramatically positive or negative changes in query performance.  The mystery is knowing how indexes need to be adjusted and what outcomes will result.  This uncertainty often leads to great reluctance to eliminate indexes that are used sparingly or only because the optimal ones are missing.  This leads to index proliferation, which ultimately produces inconsistent and poor query performance.  Some believe that the SQL Server Database Tuning Advisor will solve all these issues, but it frequently does not.  In fact, it often compounds the proliferation problem significantly.  This presentation will enable a DBA to make informed decisions regarding what query and index metrics to monitor, determine how indexes are used, and devise appropriate index strategies to improve query performance through index addition, deletion, or modification.

##Title: Actively Proactive – Straightforward Ways to Manage and Diagnose SQL##
 
**Abstract**:
Becoming a proactive DBA is something that most SQL administrators strive to be but many fall short.  Meetings, doing non-SQL related tasks, excessive workload and sometimes corporate culture often work against a DBA by creating conditions where it is nearly impossible to pay attention to the tasks involved in taking care of your SQL instances.  Our presentation will cover those proactive tasks and alerts that will provide a straightforward method of ensuring that maintenance and monitoring are working for all SQL instances you are responsible for.  Additionally, we will cover some ways to identify emergency performance problems that will allow a DBA to quickly resolve issues while making them look like the expert they truly are.

##Title: Hiding Data from Prying Eyes:  Using SQL Server 2016 Always Encrypted##
 
**Abstract**:
Past versions of SQL Server didn't include many options for encrypting data outside of network traffic and at rest.  This is going to change with SQL Server 2016, which has a new feature named "Always Encrypted".  This talk will show the fundamentals of using this technology and a demo of how to configure it and work with the encrypted data.

##Title: Building a Simple SQL Server Partitioning Solution##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will build a partitioning architecture in SQL Server for high volume insert scenarios. We’ll begin with a short discussion of our problem scenario and motivation to partition. Then, we’ll create the partitioned tables and related supporting database objects. Next, we’ll create some data access code to perform crud operations. We’ll finish by creating data retention artifacts to complete a simple, production ready partitioning solution.

##Title: Ways SQL Server Lies and the Performance Tuning Headaches It Can Cause.##
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever tried to tune a query  or searched for a  performance bottleneck just to have SQL Server lead you down a rabbit hole?   In this session we will look at some common performance issues that can occur that might be masked or hidden by misleading information  you get from SQL Server.    We will also talk about why SQL Server gives you the information it does,  and how to see past this information and find the real issues causing your performance problems.

##Title: Hostile Takeover##
 
**Abstract**:
In the spirit of Tim Ford's year long Entry Level Challenge, what do you do when given a SQL Server to manage? This presentation will walk you through how to gain access to a SQL Server you have never seen before, what are the basic tools to use to collect inventory information, and what scripts I use to best determine the "health" of the server.

##Title: Business Analytics with Microsoft Business Intelligence##
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft supplies us with many tools to produce business analytics with our company’s data. From health care to financial data, we need a friendly display of this valuable information in order for analyst to find what they are looking for or find new trends to focus in on.

It all starts with formatting your data in a dimensional model. Then, you need to be able to take that model and create a fast database in analysis services. This will consolidate the business rules and give us fast retrieval of the information.

PowerBI and Excel can be used by analysts to view this data and produced fixed dashboards and scorecards. But we also need to be able to create interactive displays for current data.

##Title: Connecting Mobile Apps with an ASP.NET Web API##
 
**Abstract**:
In this talk, we'll create an ASP.NET Web API from scratch, and then demonstrate how you can communicate with it and manipulate data using a cross-platform (iOS, Android, and Windows Phone) Xamarin Forms app. Because ASP.NET Web API is a RESTful framework, you'll also be able to use this API with any other platform that can make HTTP calls.

##Title: From Dev to Deployment: DevOps for Your Mobile App##
 
**Abstract**:
Visual Studio Team Services has some new integrations for your Xamarin mobile apps. We#39;ll be taking an existing mobile app and adding Continuous Integration to ensure your app builds, connecting to build agents, and Continuous Deployment to HockeyApp. We will also discuss another CI/CD service, Bitrise, which has its own build agents. With all of the different platforms and integration points, there#39;s no reason why these steps should be manual. Learn how to leverage your existing Microsoft tools and subscriptions to get your app out faster and with less human interaction.

##Title: DIY Performance Reporting##
 
**Abstract**:
Stop relying on vendors to provide you with performance data.  Between Windows and SQL Server you’ve already got all you need to collect and report on server performance.  And it’s far more flexible than you’ll ever get from a vendor.  This is often called a poor man’s method, but it’s so much more than that.  I’m going to show you what your options are for collecting performance data for free and you’ll even walk away with a framework you can plug into your own environment and start using tomorrow with very little effort.

##Title: Unit Testing in a Team - A Kick Starter##
 
**Abstract**:
I (and a team of people much sharper than me) tried to push unit testing onto established development teams on multiple occasions in the past, and we failed repeatedly... until we figured out the things that we'll discuss in this session.  We will cover a set of rules and guidelines for bringing the practice of unit testing into a team of developers who may or may not be interested in persuing unit testing.  We will include patterns and approaches for ensuring that the tests that we write are highly legible, maintainable, and bring genuine value to the team.  We will learn to structure our unit testing practices so that our efforts do not fade away in time due to lack of upkeep.

Unlike most of my sessions in the past, we won't be writing any code or doing demos in this session.  This will be more about the patterns and rules.  Target audience is anyone interested in bringing unit tests to their development team, or anyone has struggled to keep unit testing efforts afloat in the past.

##Title: User Experience: Empathy for our users (and teammates)##
 
**Abstract**:
At the core of User Experience is Empathy. The ability to be empathetic to your end user can be deceptively challenging. Just because something works does not always mean it is the best and easiest functionality to serve to your audience. In this session, we will review some common areas of practice in the User Experience process to get into the mind of your target user and make design and development decisions based on empathy. As an added bonus, we will also discuss how to achieve empathy for the product team around you in order to build the best possible solution for your client together.

##Title: Simple Steps for Starting Your Business##
 
**Abstract**:
Do you dream about starting a business? You’re not alone—millions of Americans share that dream. And yet, not everyone has the courage to get started. But if you’re reading this, you have already taken the first steps toward turning your dream into reality.

Obviously, dreaming alone isn’t enough. You have to do your homework, create a plan and take action. You will have good days and bad ones. But don’t get discouraged. As Walt Disney said, “If you can dream it, you can do it. Always remember this whole thing was started by a dream and a mouse.” 

Simple Steps for Starting Your Business is more than just a guide to business ownership. It’s really a blueprint for helping make your dreams a reality.

In this session Bob Breaux from the Baton Rouge SCORE chapter will introduce you to the foundations of starting your own business and give you insight into the resources that are available to you within the state of Louisiana to do so!

##Title: Pester the Tester: PowerShell Bugs Beware!##
 
**Abstract**:
So you've been developing PowerShell for a while, or perhaps you're taking over maintenance of an existing set of scripts. It would be great to get extra confidence in your scripts through testing, but how? You're in luck, there's a new module in town, Pester! 

Pester is a friendly testing framework designed for testing your PowerShells scripts and modules. In this session you'll be introduced to Pester. You'll see how to use Pester to uncover bugs, as well as using it for test driven development. Make your own PowerShell more robust through the use of Pester. Kill those PowerShell bugs, dead!

##Title: Continuous Integration and Delivery##
 
**Abstract**:
Continuous integration and continuous delivery are two practices that can drastically reduce any software company's testing and deployment times. In this talk, we will be discussing several tools (including TeamCity and Octopus Deploy)  that you can use to streamline these tasks, as well as how you can go from having nothing to a baseline project set up using a template that you've previously created on a publicly accessible development environment in less that 5 minutes. The days of copying and pasting files to a server to deploy your code are over.

##Title: Meet JSON in SQL Server 2016##
 
**Abstract**:
There have been many data lingua franca over the years (EDI, CSV, XML).  Let's meet a new comer JSON (aka Jason).  JSON is the web developers new best friend, providing a schema free way to transmit and persist data.  SQL Server 2016 has provided new functionality to work with JSON.  In this session we will look at how to read a JSON document using the OPENJSON function.  We will also look at other methods for extracting information from JSON.  Finally, we will look at how to generate JSON documents from TSQL queries.
