##Title: AutoML at scale##
 
**Abstract**:
Automating the construction and tuning of machine learning (ML) models has long been one of the goals of the ML community. This is due to several factors, most notably a sharp increase in the demand for tailored AI solutions, a relative scarcity of trained ML scientists, and the development of deep learning models with complex architectures requiring accurate design and fine-tuning.
Existing automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques have been remarkably successful in identifying good parameters for a given model, sometimes even outperforming humans. However, these options either take too long to train or they work for only a handful of parameters. That’s why Azure Machine Learning uses probabilistic latent variable model to work with DNNs without needing to fully train them. Azure Machine Learning Services (AML) provides a cloud-based environment you can use to develop, train, test, deploy, manage, and track machine learning models. AutoML in the cloud will soon become mainstream.

##Title: Statystyki danych - czy to jest istotne?##
 
**Abstract**:
Jak napisano w oficjalnej dokumentacji SQL Server: "The Query Optimizer uses statistics to create query plans that improve query performance". Wydaje się więc, że zrozumienie tego jak dbać o statystyki jest jednym z kluczowych punktów podnoszenia wydajności naszych serwerów. 

Sesja pomyślana tak, by ilość slajdów ograniczyć do minimum i jak najwięcej czasu poświęcić na dema. Oczywiście będzie odrobina teorii, ale przede wszystkich będziemy statystyki tworzyć, kasować, aktualizować na różne sposoby. Spróbujemy też czytać je tak jak robi to Optymalizator Zapytań. Zobaczymy też różnice, jakie zaszły w interpretacji oraz mechanizmach aktualizujacych statystyki wraz z wprowadzeniem SQL Server 2014 i 2017. A na koniec przeniesiemy statystyki bazy produkcyjnej do bazy testowej.

##Title: Processing Large Tabular models with Analysis Services Partition Manager##
 
**Abstract**:
Processing of Tabular model is very common situation, there are many of solution for this problem: starting from  SSIS packages and ends on Azure Logic App. But what, when there is very large data model and time for processing limited to 5 minutes? The full processing takes too long, what's more there is no necessary to reload all the data, only data from last month can be changed and needs to be reloaded. In this case Partition manager is good solution which can limit the processing time to necessary minimum. During the session I will show how to easy implement solution, also I will tell about processing types and performance tips for large tabular models. 
Session in Polish.

##Title: Wprowadzenie do SQL Server Data Tools##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) jest bardzo bogatym narzędziem pozwalającym administratorom oraz deweloperom na prawidłowe zarządzanie kodem źródłowym baz danych. Jego znajomość może okazać się bardzo przydatna właśnie teraz, kiedy wiele przedsiębiorstw zaczyna rozumieć potrzebę traktowania kodu bazodanowego podobnie do kodu aplikacyjnego. Dzięki SSDT w bardzo łatwy sposób możesz zacząć wdrażać to podejście w swoim projekcie, co pozwoli na dalsze ulepszenia, takie jak automatyzacja procesów CI/CD.

Na tej sesji dowiesz się jakie funkcjonalności dostarcza SSDT, jak stworzyć nowy projekt bazodanowy zawierający model bazy danych, jak za jego pomocą wgrać zmiany na serwer bazodanowy oraz jak porównać istniejącą bazę z wzorcowym modelem.

##Title: Query optimization on steroids with SQL Server 2017/2019##
 
**Abstract**:
Adaptive or Intelligent? Maybe both? SQL Server 2017 has come into the light packed with automated query tuning based on the Query Store and Plan Cache. 
SQL Server 2019 has a lot more important features like  =batch mode on rowstore, memory grant feedback, interleaved execution, adaptative joins, deferred compilation and approximate query processing. So now we have entered the Intelligent Query Processing world!.

I would like to present both the AQP and IQP to show what you can expect in the nearest future and how these features help your queries running faster

##Title: Docker for data amateur##
 
**Abstract**:
Even tough it's nothing new, Docker is a thing nowadays. I've decided to check containers out as well and learn how they can help me. Although I'm a BI consultant and not really using Docker and containers in the current projects, I've already found them to be very helpful on my daily basis learning and other activities. If you are also passionate about data and still experimenting with SQL Server and/or Python and/or any other technology, please join the session and see how Docker can change your life. 
I will show you my journey, my thoughts and my findings regarding the usage of SQL Server and Python together with Docker. And there will be a lot, a lot of demos.

##Title: How does the recursive CTE work?##
 
**Abstract**:
We all know CTEs and the recursive version of it. But how does it work internally? Why sometimes it can produce an unexpected result?

If you want to know how does recursive CTE work internally, want to know more about non-blocking, blocking and semi-blocking query plan operators, want to familiarise yourself with the spools, asserts, compute scalars - come to this session. I will analyse the whole query plan flow, describe the internals of the used operators and show you other situations where they are useful (or not).

##Title: Mój własny wykres w Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
Paleta podstawowa komponentów wizualizacyjnych w Power BI zwykle pokrywa większość naszych potrzeb, a w razie pojawienia się większego apetytu mamy mozliwość korzystać z zawartości półek Marketplace lub niezależnych producentów. Jeśli jednak tak szeroka oferta w jakiś sposób nie jest zbieżna z naszą wizją to możemy sami stworzyć komponent wizualizacyjny. W czasie sesji pokażę Wam jak się do tego zabrać od strony narzędziowej, które "klocki" należy poznać i jakiego rodzaju umiejętności są kluczowe przy tworzeniu własnego typu wykresu. Oczwiście, w trakcie tych kilku kwadransów powstanie taki komponent, który bedzie gotowy do użycia na naszym dashboardzie.

##Title: Hidden aspects of SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
Nowadays we are dealing with super efficient auto-tuning database servers but our queries sometimes run very slow. Everything looks ok but in our monitoring tools we can see higher resource consumption, wait statistics associated with locks or tempdb activity etc. What is the reason of this? During the session I will show few not very well-known aspects of work with SQL Server that can affect performance of specific queries and entire instance. During the session you will find a lot of practical demonstrations and tips that will help you diagnose specific problems and errors.

##Title: How to quickly cook a brand new visual for Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
You have two ways to create a new visual for your great Power BI reports. The first one is to take something called Typescript and code a new stuff. It’s simple and exciting, isn’t it?  The second way is easier and cooler... Use Charticulator! This tool with a strange name gives you everything to prepare your own visual from a scratch without coding, only with dragging and dropping.

##Title: Database Adventure##
 
**Abstract**:
Aimed mostly at administration and based on real life scenarios, in this audience interactive session we will go through some scenarios DBA's might encounter whilst dealing with SQL Server databases and you will be provided with some options about what to do. Members of the audience will then select from these options what to do and we will follow that path and see what the outcome is from there.

Each selection will have a different outcome, and along the way you will probably learn some new things.

Despite the diversity of processed data, the approach to their presentation still has a lot in common. I'd like to tell you about tools, which have their own approach to SQL language. We will see how NoSQL in MongoDB, OQL in Pivotal GemFire ​​and KSQL in Apache Kafka can imitate the most popular elements of the SQL language.
