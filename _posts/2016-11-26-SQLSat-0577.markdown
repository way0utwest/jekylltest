##Title: Переход в облако: Microsoft Azure и базы данных (ru)##
 
**Abstract**:
В данной сессии будет рассказано о том, какие плюсы и минусы ожидают организацию в случае принятия решения о переносе СУБД из локального датацентра в облако от Microsoft. Мы поговорим о практике использования виртуальных машин (IaaS), сервисов (PaaS), а также о имеющихся альтернативах (гибридные решения). Основной темой будут реляционные базы данных, однако также будут затронуты и другие облачные технологии хранения и обработки данных как от компании Microsoft так и от её конкурентов.
Аудитория: ИТ руководители, разработчики и администраторы, которые ещё не работали с Microsoft Azure и которые хотят понять какие выгоды можно получить от миграции баз данных в облако и какие подводные камни их ожидают. Доклад не будет интересен людям, которые уже активно работают с вышеперечисленными технологиями.

##Title: NSA Secrets - Hacking SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
How easy is it to hack a SQL Server? 
In this session we'll see a few examples on how to exploit SQL Server, modify data and take control, while at the same time not leaving a trace.
We'll start by gaining access to a SQL Server (using some "creative" ways of making man-in-the-middle attacks), escalating privileges and tampering with data at the TDS protocol level (e.g. changing your income level and reverting without a trace after payment), and more. 
Most importantly, we'll also cover recommendations on how to avoid these attacks, and take a look at the pros and cons of new security features in SQL Server 2016.
This is a demo-driven session, suited for DBAs, developers and security consultants (Jedi level). 
Disclaimer: No actual state secrets will be revealed. Please do not send agents to my house again.

##Title: Как убить SQL Server за 60 минут##
 
**Abstract**:
Простота и гибкость SQL Server  существенно облегчают использование продукта в качестве сервера БД. Несмотря на то, что эта простота зачастую приводит к неэффективным решениям и коду, современные сервера способны скрыть проблемы с производительностью, что преуменьшает роль разработчиков и администраторов БД в производственном процессе. 

В этом докладе Дмитрий продемонстрирует несколько простых методов дизайна БД и написания T-SQL кода, которые помогут Вам ухудшить производительность систем работающих с SQL Server и, в результате, сделают Вашу жизнь более интересной и улучшат job security.

##Title: PostgreSQL as a Document Storage for .NET applications##
 
**Abstract**:
In a relational database system we must define a schema before adding data to a database but sometimes we need to store and (that is more important) query semi-structured data. And of course it would be great if we could use the same interface to access both structured and semi-structured data. The session will describe how to solve it via building IQueryable document storage for .NET applications using PostgreSQL and jsonb.

##Title: @Table vs #Table: шаблони використання, спільні характеристики, міфи##
 
**Abstract**:
MS SQL Server надає дві можливості для зберігання тимчасових наборів даних: тимчасові табиці та табличні змінні. Вважається, що табличні треба використовувати для маленьких об'ємів даних (бо вони  живуть в оперативній пам'яті), а тимчасові таблиці - для великих. Подивимося, чи дійсно це так; чи можна за такими характеристиками порівнювати ці об'єкти.

##Title: Azure Search - full-text search in a cloud##
 
**Abstract**:
During this session we will talk about Azure Search - full-text search engine provided to us via SaaS model. The main advantage of this service is not only that is fully managed by Microsoft, scalable, reliable and all other cloud related stuff. It is more about numerous data sources you can use to populate your search indexes. Also, because you use HTTP to work with Azure Search, you can easily use it not only within your desktop or web applications, but also you can easily consume it in your mobile applications, IoT solutions, etc.

##Title: SQL Server: Delivery and synchronizing of the data##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we are going to discuss different methods of the data delivery.
Why do we need them? In which cases should we use them?  
We will concern following technologies and definitions (cloud of tags): HA/DR, AlwayOn HAG, Replication, CDC, Log Shipping, Mirroring, Heterogeneous synchronization partners and, probably, something else :-)
In the demonstration we'll consider the one interesting example of using the Replication.

##Title: Always Encrypted at rest and in motion##
 
**Abstract**:
Does your application work with the sensitive data? 

Always Encrypted is one of the newest SQL Server 2016 features, that provides a new way to encrypt columns. Data is protected at rest and in motion. You can encrypt your sensitive data on the client, send across the network and store encrypted data in the database. The database administrator can't read your data without special key. Always Encrypted provides a separation between those who own the data and those who manage the data.
