## Title: DMV's as a Shortcut to Procedure Tuning
 
**Abstract**:
Dynamic Management Views (DMV) expose a wealth of information to the database administrator. However, they also expose information that is vital to the database developer. More often than not people gather performance metrics through server side traces. This session will show how to gather information from the DMVs for currently executing, and recently executed queries. The session will demonstrate combining this information with other DMVs to get more intersting information such as the query plan and query text. I'll show where you can get aggregate information for the queries in cache to determine which queries are being frequently accessed or using the most resources. Indexes used, fragmentation and more.

## Title: I/O I/O It's Why My Server's Slow - Waits  Queues
 
**Abstract**:
Based on the popular cover-story article appearing in SQL Server Magazine, Robert Pearl expands on ways to measure SQL Server's performance and present the information in a readable and useful format.  He will bring us useful tips for getting and analyzing I/O information, and troubleshoot performance bottlenecks.

In addition, Robert will scratch the surface and introduce performance tuning using a methodology called Waits and Queues, with respect to I/O. By using this methodology one can identify the best opportunities to improve performance, the so called “biggest bang for the buck”. These performance improvements are likely to have a significant return on the performance tuning time investment.

## Title: Transactional Replication Fundamentals
 
**Abstract**:
Transactional Replication is a popular method for distributing data in SQL Server. It is most frequently used to offload reporting from an OLTP server to a reporting/OLAP Server. In this session SQL Server MVP Hilary Cotter shows you how to get up to speed quickly in deploying transactional replication solutions, as well as to how to squeeze optimal performance out of your transactional replication topology. Also covered is how to achieve DR using transactional replication, bi-directional transactional replication, how to integrate your replication solution with your DR solution. Also covered is peer to peer replication, a form or replication which keeps multiple geographically dispersed nodes to keep synchronized.

## Title: Get your database under version control
 
**Abstract**:
It's a given that the source code to your project's ETL, Cubes, User Interfaces, WCF services, etc are kept under tight version control. But many developers turn a blind eye to source code in their database - the critical views, stored procedures, and user defined functions.

With a few concepts and tools build into every version of SQL Server I'll show how to build simple and free version control for your project.

## Title: Notes on Linked Servers
 
**Abstract**:
Did you know that permission can have a profound impact on performance? Did you know that sometimes it's better to move data to the logic and other times it's better to move the logic to data? Did you know that it can make a huge performance difference whether you push data or pull data across the servers? The common thread among these questions is linked servers. Because of the convenience they provide in moving data around on the server side, linked servers are used in almost all the SQL Server environments, and are often abused in many. This session focuses on a series of linked server cases--primarily performance related cases--encountered in in the real world to help reveal traps and highlight best practices.

## Title: Partitioning in SQL Server 2005/2008
 
**Abstract**:
Starting with SQL Server 2005, Microsoft has made a significant effort to truly streamline partitioning data to be on par with industry leading databases like Oracle. The potential was not fully harnessed by the SQL Server community primarily due to the lack of any user interface associated with partitioning and due to lack of cohesive documentation. For many, Kimberly Tripp’s white paper on “Partitioned Tables and Indexes in SQL Server 2005” is generally regarded as a primary guiding source that bridges the void in MS documentation. Come and get a quick start on partitioning. It is simple, efficient. Manageability and performance come part and parcel.

## Title: Attribute Discretization in Analysis Services
 
**Abstract**:
Attribute discretization is an oft-overlooked feature in Analysis Services that allows us to automatically create a manageable number of groups of attribute values that are clearly separated by boundaries. Discretization can help us to make it easier for information consumers to work with large numbers of possible attribute member values. In this session, we will discuss the varied options, the design (and other) considerations involved, and best practices surrounding the use of this capability.

## Title: Getting Started with MDX
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.

## Title: Handling data anomalies with Data Profiling Tasks
 
**Abstract**:
Within the realm of the financial world, data is often sourced from a plethora of financial systems that more often than not have different formats and business rules. This poses many challenges to the integration of the data into corporate data warehouses. Metrics and tools to detect data anomalies (prior to insertion into the corporate data warehouses) were often difficult to create and often overlooked. This hands-on presentation will show the attendee how we have been able to revamp and revise our preload data validations, often removing many of our ‘early warning’ queries and replacing these with SSIS 2008 Data Profiling Tasks.

## Title: 12 ways to write POORLY performing MDX queries
 
**Abstract**:
OLAP cubes have become an important means of delivering valuable information from complex data within the Corporate Data Warehouse. Adequate information helps the corporate decision makers take the necessary steps to ensure that the enterprise is heading in the correct direction, especially in the tough and turbulent economic times. This beginner’s to intermediate level hands-on presentation is aimed at showing the attendee some of the pitfalls of poorly designed and poorly performing MDX queries and how many of the queries may be optimized to ensure that they are both efficient and effective.
