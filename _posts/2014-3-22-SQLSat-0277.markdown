## Title: Squeezing the Most out of Row  Page Compression
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2008 brought us the ability to do Row and Page level compression in our databases but even today many people are not taking full advantage of these wonderful features. The most common bottle neck today is physical I/O and SQL Server compression can help with that in most cases. If you are not sure how these features work or how to apply them in your environment this session is for you. We will discuss in detail how the compression schemes work at both the row and page levels along with which data types may or may not be able to participate. We will see from various demos what else affects the compression ratio and just how extensive it can be under the right conditions. Nothing comes for free though so we will also cover the pros and cons along with why, when and most importantly how to use it effectively.

## Title: SQL Server Internals Party: Storage, Memory and the Query Life-cycle
 
**Abstract**:
Come meet the Internals of SQL Server at this special get-together! In this presentation we will cover the basics of data storage and querying with SQL Server. We will cover how data is stored in pages and extents and how that translates to data reads/writes with the storage system. Additionally, we will explore how different queries are processed by SQL Server and how the query life cycle works in general. Finally we will cover disk storage and memory and tie it all together. This session is intended to be broad and to give a general overview of how a query is processed in SQL Server and how storage and memory play a part in that. Everyone is invited to this introductory level presentation and should be appealing to DBAs, DB  BI Developers and System Administrators. Party hats not included, rated G for Geeks.

## Title: SQL 2012 Table Compression
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2008 has introduced Table compression to the DBA toolkit.  We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server.  What some may not know is the subtleties of compression.  Such subtleties include that not all Page Compressed tables are entirely page compressed.  This session will show you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level.  At the lower level, this session will also show how to determine compression settings of objects in the database.  Participants will be able to use undocumented commands as well as commands such as PIVOT to derive some interesting information from the database engine.

## Title: 12 Steps to Workload Tuning
 
**Abstract**:
We might know how to tune a query for optimal performance or create additional indexes to ensure faster execution, but how do we ensure that our changes don’t hurt our total workload? Have you ever completed an upgrade and wondered if you were truly getting better performance?  Do we know if the new 3rd Party application upgrade will make performance better or worse? In this session, we will go over a process used to tune a workload and answer the common questions above. In this presentation we will also use Distributed Replay, XEvents and ClearTrace to answer these questions and even give you a little insight into how you can document these changes to help you get that next raise.

## Title: Crazy Things That Developers Do
 
**Abstract**:
Throughout my career, I've seen developers do some pretty crazy things to databases (and truth be told, I've done some of these myself!). Come to this session to learn what we do (from opening up the database to SQL Injection attacks, how SQL can use Referential Integrity to optimze queries, and the pitfalls of using NOLOCK), why it's bad to the database server (or your career)... and alternatives that can be used instead. Trust me... your DBA will love you for making these changes.

## Title: DataViz You Thought You Couldn't Do with SSRS
 
**Abstract**:
Despite SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) being a very flexible and adaptable tool when it comes to visualization techniques, very few venture beyond its ready-made charts. Most of the time, all it takes to build a chart considered “outside the scope” of SSRS is a bit of lateral thinking. Sometimes, we need to go a little further and use custom code. Join this session as we bust popular myths around "impossible in SSRS" visualizations and construct them live in SSRS!

## Title: Using Expressions to Avoid Three SSRS Annoyances
 
**Abstract**:
As powerful as it is, SQL Server Reporting Services still has frustrating annoyances. Three in particular are: 1) non-queried parameter values must be entered one value at a time, with lots of clicking along with way; 2) the page header and page footer sections cannot contain data regions and therefore cannot display sets of data-driven values; and 3) matrix reports promise the analytical ability of Excel PivotTables but fall short because they are fixed and lack the ability to dynamically slice-and-dice data by values selected by the user. With the expression techniques taught in this session, these annoyances will annoy no longer because you will be able to work around all three.
