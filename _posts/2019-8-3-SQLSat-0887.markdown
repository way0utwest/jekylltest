##Title: SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases##
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps is based on building an application binary (immutable artifact) that supports a highly reliable, repeatable engineering process.  In the case of SQL Server, however, a database is already in production, and isn’t simply replaced (as an app binary), but is upgraded.   Current SQL Server DevOps methods use source control to build a “development” database, with schema and objects and static data needed for functional testing.  "Near production data" is used in Staging, and finally production is upgraded.  This approach involves complexity, and breaks the principle of working with immutable artifacts throughout the process.  Our session introduces a new approach to SQL Server DevOps, with production databases used in all stages.   Production database clones are delivered more quickly than "built" databases, are more easily integrated with source control, and produces higher fidelity outcomes.  Learn how leading enterprises are simplifying SQL DevOps.

##Title: What's New in SQL Server 2019: 100% Demos##
 
**Abstract**:
You haven't installed SQL Server 2019 yet, and you don't want to sit through a bunch of slides. You want to see a series of real-world demos focusing on the features of SQL Server 2019 that will make your users happier with as little work as possible on your part. You don't have time to rewrite all your queries or learn new languages - you just want the database to go faster.

I'm Brent Ozar, and I'll give you the whirlwind tour. I'll focus on just the features that make the biggest bang for the buck, things you can implement right away and see a noticeable difference. I'll show you what kinds of code will benefit the most so you can go back to the office and have an honest discussion with management about what to expect.

No slides here - not even an about-me slide. Let's dive into some queries!

##Title: Beginning Admin: The Care and Feeding of SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
Design and development may be exciting, but database administration is absolutely critical (and, reasonably well-paying!) The care and feeding of a server tends to get short-changed or neglected.  In this class, we'll cover the basics of the big five administrator tasks:

* Backups – You must set up regular backups, to keep copies of your databases...just in case something breaks, or someone makes a bad, bad mistake.
* Integrity checks – Regularly and automatically check databases for corruption, which is when bits get scrambled, lost, and ruined.
* Index maintenance – Databases need regular upkeep so they'll continue to run well.
* Disk management – It's actually your job to find out about full disks before they happen. After all, databases grow!
* Alerting – Alerts tell you what's wrong, so you don't have to go looking for problems.

Being a database administrator is a big job, but we can cover the basics in one session!

##Title: Azure Machine Learning 101##
 
**Abstract**:
There are several ways to create a machine learning model. You can use R or Python or even other languages such as C#. Advanced coding skills are required no matter which language you choose. Once the solution is created, it’s often difficult to deploy. 

Microsoft addresses those problems with Azure Machine Learning, or Azure ML. Azure ML has built-in transforms for cleansing and munging data. It also contains a variety of configurable machine learning models that can be used without coding. Deploying the model is easy, and users can link to it directly with Excel or a custom application can be written.

If you are experienced in machine learning but haven’t seen Azure ML or if you are curious about machine learning and data science, this session is for you.

##Title: Reducing The Surface Area Of Risk in Data Security##
 
**Abstract**:
Data masking is likely to become a new legal requirement.  Don't let this catch your organization unaware and flat-footed!

For decades, IT has been negligent, using production data during software development and testing, exposing sensitive data to those not authorized to access it.  That decades-old practice must end.

Data masking is the solution for providing non-production environments (i.e. DEV, TEST, etc) with realistic but artificial data for development and testing, while reducing the surface area of risk for breaching data.

The alternative, generating test data, incurs classic problems of engineering bias as well as blindness to true-to-life data scenarios which arise in the "wild".

Masking real production data retains realistic data conditions and distributions while merely obfuscating real data.

Masking is important, and sophisticated software packages are available today, but the field is new enough that there is lots of room for improvement in all of them.

There has been a movement towards PowerShell in the SQL Server Community lately. With so much out there, how do you get ahead.  I will take you through this massive module that has grown very quickly to over 300 functions for use in your daily DBA job. This module can single handedly migrate an entire server with one command, or you can choose the parts you want to do and just do those. Join me to find out how you can quickly leverage the power of this module. This is one tool you want in your PowerShell toolbox.

##Title: Are all RDBMS systems created equally?##
 
**Abstract**:
We all love SQL Server but is it really so much different than Postgres, Oracle or Mysql?  I've spent a lot of years in many of these technologies and I want people to understand the good and the bad about the different technologies out there.  My goal with this session is to entertain and to hopefully open your eyes to the reality that if you have skills and knowledge of RDBMS you shouldn't be afraid of ever finding a job in any of these technologies.

##Title: Women In Tech Panel##
 
**Abstract**:
The greatest supporter of women are other women! Women are 18% of the professional field in data analytics. This is even less than the IT field as a whole. For those that identify as women, feel motivated seeing other women in this space share their journeys. For allies, take an opportunity to see and hear from women and other allies on how to support them.

##Title: Advanced Power BI Modeling Techniques##
 
**Abstract**:
Creating a Power BI data model is pretty easy, but sometimes we have to deal with more complex scenarios the require us to dig a little deeper. 

In this session we'll take your modeling skills to the next level as we explore a few advanced techniques that deal with displaying measures in the rows of a table (as opposed to the columns), dynamic currency conversions and an alternate approach to role-playing dimensions.

##Title: Availability Groups: What They’re Not Telling You##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2012 brought to life a new form of high availability and disaster recovery in the form of Availability Groups (AGs). This all sounds fantastic, but in reality there are issues and problems that are generally not discussed, or well known, that can impact your HA/DR story and cause major performance issues. In this session, I’ll give a brief overview on AGs in SQL Server 2012 and the enhancements that come in 2014 and 2016. Then we’ll get into some of the problems that exist, that I’ve seen in the real world of using AGs, and that you should be aware of before implementing it in your environment.

##Title: Dynamic SQL: When, Why, and How to Use It##
 
**Abstract**:
You're comfortable writing T-SQL, and you've built a lot of stored procedures that have a bunch of parameters. For example, you have that "product search" stored proc with parameters for product category, name, price range, sort order, etc, and you have to accept any of 'em. 

So how do we make those go fast? And how can we get 'em to use indexes?

In one all-demo hour, performance tuner Brent Ozar will show you several ways that fail in comically bad ways. You'll learn how to write dynamic SQL that's easy to tune, manage, and troubleshoot.

##Title: Clustered, Non-Clustered and Covering Indexes Oh My!##
 
**Abstract**:
So you have a brand new table with lots of data and when you do a query it takes forever to return. So you add an index to improve performance and it still takes forever. Huh? Let's talk about what an index really is, the different kinds of indexes, and we will finish with a scenario where even though you have the perfect index, it is still not used.

##Title: The Lost Science of Set Theory##
 
**Abstract**:
Many database developers today do not have a Computer Science degree and may also have begun their career developing software using procedural programming languages (Java, C#, etc.). As a result, they may not have the background needed to conceptualize solutions in terms of sets of data and therefore may not be able to develop efficient set-based queries. In this session, we will review the basics of set theory and how it applies to database development to enable you to turn cursors, loops, and other procedural programming practices into efficient set-based operations that make the most use of a relational database engine.

##Title: Faster Transactions: Query Tuning for Data Manipulation##
 
**Abstract**:
Your server has dozens of CPUs, terabytes of RAM, and solid-state drives, and yet your UPDATE query still takes hours. Why? In this demo-filled session we will discuss common pitfalls for any SQL professional who is manipulating large sets of data with INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. Not only will you learn about potential issues involving data pages, locks, and the transaction log, but also what techniques you can use to improve performance.
