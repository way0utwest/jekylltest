## Title: Reducing the impact of database changes on an app
 
**Abstract**:
The session is about domain driven development. It seems most ORM frameworks being out there do not really solve the abstraction problem between the two as these are table centric. Do such really follow SOA principles when it comes to treating the db? Empower your next project with... server side ORM. I will let you deeply rethink what you've done so far.
 
My approach let me save days or weeks of otherwise wasted development hours when it comes to "make a change". You might feel ORM of your choice seem let you kickstart the project faster, but then... every major change and tweak here and there is a nightmare (refactor, recompile, retest, redeploy). Rewriting an app after every change is like working one step forward, two step backwards.

## Title: SQL Design Patterns
 
**Abstract**:
atterns emerge as both templated solutions to recurring problems and designs, as well as provide useful ways to encapsulate complex ideas into smaller, friendlier terms. Patterns gained popularity in the object-orientated community since the Fowler and the Gang Of Four, but declarative languages, like SQL, have had little-to-no coverage of how these patterns can be applied. Understanding SQL design patterns is a crucial skill every SQL developer must learn and use in their career. SQL patterns can be applied to small projects or large, multi-million dollar systems, to provide common solutions to complex problems. Patterns create a foundation for "best practices" for SQL, Database Architecture, managers.

## Title: Replication ABCs
 
**Abstract**:
Database Replication is a daunting subject.  This session will lay out the basics of what replication is, the options available to you, the tools you can use and a survey of related technologies.

## Title: Getting SQL Service Broker Up and Running
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008 include a fantastic feature that few people understand or use.  That feature is the Microsoft SQL Server Service Broker.  The SQL Service Broker is one of the least used features within the database engine, and that lack of use is simply from last of knowledge about the feature.

In this session we’ll dig into how to configure the service broker for not only intra-database message queuing, but database to database queuing as well as server to server database queuing.  We will also dig into a real life scenario where the SQL Server Service Broker was used to do ETL from an OLTP database to an OLAP database in near real time for near real time reporting.

## Title: Building nTier Apps with Entity Framework - Part 2
 
**Abstract**:
Learn how to build real world nTier applications with the new Entity Framework and related services. Make sure to attend Part 1.  This second part to the series will focus on using the Entity Framework in an nTier/ SOA world by separating out the different layers using T4 templates and using the new WCF Data Services to easily expose entity models via REST and to Silverlight clients. Lots of code!

## Title: Implementing Fine-grained Data Security
 
**Abstract**:
Data security presents a challenge for many groups in a company. Application requirements often specify different data content for various users, while those responsible for security recognize the need to limit access as much as possible.  Available options typically involve trade-offs in security, flexibility, and added work. SQL Server provides a number of security features, but row-level security is missing.  This session will consider some current architectural approaches to implementing flexible data security, and then examine a packaged solution for SQL Server to effectively customize row and column access for users without login accounts.

## Title: SQL at the Speed of Flash 
 
**Abstract**:
Solid-state technologies are changing the way that MS SQL users run their databases. DBA’s are achieving significant performance increases using solid state storage.  The bottom line: SQL runs 4-10x faster on solid state.  This session will discuss the various solid-state storage options with their pros and cons. This session will provide practical knowledge around the use of solid state storage for databases and will use real-world use cases to demonstrate the performance advantages of using solid state.

## Title: Ace the Interview
 
**Abstract**:
Job Search: Too often what separates us from the job we want is that we don't do HOW to interview.  Sadly, if you don't know how to do something, you will probably not do it well.  This session is designed to give you the inside track on what employers are looking for and includes an interactive hands-on portion where you can hone your interviewing skills.

## Title: Caching your data with Microsoft AppFabric
 
**Abstract**:
Take your system to the next level and scale highly read infrequently changed data with AppFabric today!  AppFabric (code named “Velocity”) has been released and is the latest high availability caching product from Microsoft.  Every database professional should understand this new technology as another tool in scaling their database systems.  This session will review the physical and logical architecture, configuring, and interacting with AppFabric API.  Session will demo retrieving data from SQL Server and caching it into an AppFabric structure.

## Title: Database "Insecurity"
 
**Abstract**:
We all know that database security is important.  Data is the lifeblood of modern business.  Moreover, Microsoft has given us tremendous tools for securing our databases at the database level.  Yet, how many database developers and database administrators use them?  How many understand them?  Database security is woefully neglected.  There are relatively few articles published on database security.  There are no new books on database security.  Compare this with the tremendous number of books, articles and conferences on Network Security.  Yet, our databases are vulnerable.  This is a call to action.

## Title: Database  Antipatterns
 
**Abstract**:
We've all seen them.  We've commiserated with one another about them over coffee at conferences and in blog sites.  Bad database design is much more common than good database design.  This discussion will cover a few of the most prominent "Antipatterns" common to database design today.

## Title: Looking at LINQ
 
**Abstract**:
LINQ was introduced in .NET 3.0... by .NET 4.0 parts of it are almost depricated.  Let's look at LINQ, what are its strengths, where does it fit moving forward.  We'll talk about LINQ to SQL, LINQ to Dataset, LINQ to Entities, LINQ to CAML and where each of these fit.

## Title: Query Tuning - Get it Right the First Time
 
**Abstract**:
Whether you are a developer or DBA, this presentation will outline a method for determining the best approach for tuning a query 
every time by utilizing response time analysis and SQL Diagramming techniques.  Regardless of the complexity of the statement or 
database platform being utilized (this method works on all), this quick and systematic approach will lead you down the correct 
tuning path with no guessing.  If you are a beginner or expert, this approach will save you countless hours tuning a query.

## Title: Building nTier Apps with Entity Framework - Part 1
 
**Abstract**:
Learn how to build real world nTier applications with the new Entity Framework and related services. With this new technology built into .NET, you can easily wrap an object model around your database and have all the data access automatically generated or use your own stored procedures and views. The session will demonstrate how to create and consume these new technologies from the ground up and focus on database modeling including views and stored procedures along with coding against the model via LINQ. Dynamic data website will also be demonstrated. Lots of code! Make sure to attend Part 2.

## Title: Performance Tuning with Traces
 
**Abstract**:
We'll touch on SQL Profiler and review its best practices so that you don't impact the production system while gathering data.  We'll take a deep dive into server-side traces (SQL Trace) and show how you can run a constant server-side trace with little impact on the production system.  We'll also examine the things that I look for when troubleshooting performance issues.

## Title: Reading the SQL Server Execution Plan
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we'll explain what the SQL Execution plan is, how the SQL Server generates it, and how to read the output.  This includes looking at the graphical as well as the XML version of the execution plan.  We'll explore the variety of operators that the execution plan can present you with, and show you how to tell the SQL Server that you want to change the execution plan to get rid of the operators that you don't want to be using any more.
