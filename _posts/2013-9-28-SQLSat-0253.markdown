##Title: Mapeamento Objeto-Relacional com Entity Framework ##
 
**Abstract**:
O Entity Framework é a tecnologia de acesso a dados recomendada pela Microsoft para o desenvolvimento de novas aplicações na plataforma .NET. É uma tecnologia de mapeamento objeto-relacional que reduz as dificuldades da programação orientada a objetos com persistência de dados em bancos de dados relacionais. Atualmente, o Entity Framework está disponível na versão 5. Porém, a versão 6 está próxima da versão final (RTM), que será lançada juntamente com a versão final (RTM) do Visual Studio 2013 e com o Windows 8.1 GA, em 18 de outubro de 2013. Veja as abordagens de modelagem suportadas pelo Entity Framework durante a fase de desenvolvimento: Code First, Model First e Database First.

##Title: Dividir e conquistar - Particionando de tabelas no SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
O particionamento de tabelas em um banco de dados melhora o desempenho e simplifica a manutenção. Ao dividir uma tabela grande em frações menores, as consultas que acessam somente uma fração dos dados serão executadas com maior rapidez além de aumentarmos a performance de tarefas administativas como reconstruir índices e backups.

##Title: In-Memory OLAP a.k.a ColumnStore Index##
 
**Abstract**:
Nessa sessão você irá entender o recurso "In-Memory" para ambientes OLAP no SQL Server, como as informações são armazenadas em colunas, como o recurso se beneficia de paralelismo, compressão, eliminação de segmento, batch mode dentre outros. No SQL Server 2012 o ColumnStore Index é um recurso somente "Read-Only" porém no SQL Sever 2014 ele se torna leitura e escrita além de possuir mais alguma melhorias que iremos entender nesse sessão.
