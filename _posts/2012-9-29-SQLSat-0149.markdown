## Title: PowerShell 101
 
**Abstract**:
If you haven't dug in to PowerShell at this point, you're missing out on some amazing, powerful, practical stuff that could save you time every day. PowerShell does have a learning curve at the outset, especially for those not already familiar with OO concepts or programming in a language like C#, so this introductory session will go through the very basics of PowerShell syntax. If that collection of pipes and hyphens and curly braces seems to be written in some incomprehensible foreign language, this session is for you. At the end of the session you should have a grasp of how and why a PowerShell script does what it does, and the confidence to dig in deeper and begin using POSH scripts in your own work.

## Title: Anatomy of a Join
 
**Abstract**:
A lot of database professionals today  do not have a Computer-Science Degree  so they never attended a  “Introduction to Databases” course. In this session we are trying to fix at least one thing and we’ll look in depth at the three types of join operations, visualize how their algorithms work in order to understand how query plans are computed, explain why these join operations have very different performance characteristics and why the optimizer chooses a specific  join operator to use in a query plan. Will demonstrate that empirical cost calculations are similar to what Query Optimizer actually outputs. Good understanding of join algorithms is vital in order to diagnose and remedy issues related to bad query plans.

## Title: Design and Implement BI Like Edison! 
 
**Abstract**:
As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor. In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence.

## Title: Practically Normal
 
**Abstract**:
Normalizing a database - splitting apart tables into simpler, more focused tables - can yield concrete benefits, including manageability, scalability, and space savings.  The concept is a central tenet of a relational database system such as SQL Server, yet far too many database professionals are unfamiliar with it.  This session will present a practical primer on normalization: what it is, why it's beneficial, how to do it, and when not to do it.

## Title: Getting to Know Index Operation Stats
 
**Abstract**:
There's a lot that goes on under the covers of SQL Server with your indexes. But it's not as secretive as you might think. Most of this information is made available to you through DMVs. While this information is useful - you need a clear understanding of what is in the DMVs in order to understand what is going on. In this session we'll take a dive into sys.dm_index_operational_stats to find out what it does and what you can do with this information.

## Title: Dimensional Data Model Prototyping With PowerPivot
 
**Abstract**:
Data modeling is often an abstract exercise involving a lot of talk and diagrams, but little hands-on experimentation.  This may still be viable in the world of transactional systems where a lack of source data prevents the modeler from quickly creating a prototype system, however in the world of dimensional modeling where source data is abundant there’s no longer a reason to treat data modeling as an academic exercise.  This session will cover how to use PowerPivot for Excel to quickly create prototypes of different dimensional models to try out and discard as necessary.  The features of PowerPivot which allow quick import of data from a variety of data sources will also be demonstrated.

## Title: Documenting Your Integrated Microsoft BI Solution
 
**Abstract**:
Having implemented BI solutions for years, I have found documentation to be a task too often resisted until late in the project, when it is hastily and incompletely prepared in remaining hours. Because the integrated Microsoft BI solution comprises multiple application layers, it is challenging to generate documentation about the whole solution in a single, unified document. In this presentation I will share approaches I’ve come to use in assembling documentation that “covers all the bases.”

## Title: Recovering from Corruption
 
**Abstract**:
Corruption cannot always be avoided. You can take steps to ensure early detection, and you can prepare for the eventuality of it occurring, but it's not possible to completely prevent it. Early detection is your best protection against data lost due to corruption.

In this session, we will discuss the protections within SQL Server to help identify corruption and to help recover from it. We will look at the different types of corruption that could hit your database and the best way to deal with each type. Includes live demos recovering from different types of corrupt databases.
