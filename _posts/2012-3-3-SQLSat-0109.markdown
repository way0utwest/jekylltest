##Title: Best Practices for Monitoring SQL Server on VMware##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server on VMware???  Most of our customers have virtualized their application tier, but now are either virtualizing databases or planning to do so soon. Some companies have tried to virtualize databases on VMware already but went back to physical hardware because of performance issues. There are many reasons this may have happened, but quite often the decision to go back to physical was not based on hard facts. This presentation will explore the fundamentals of monitoring databases running in a VMware environment. If you are using classic O/S monitoring tools using standard Perfmon counters, you are getting misleading information. Understand which metrics are important and how to get the data.

##Title: FileTable and Semantic Search in SQL Server 2012##
 
**Abstract**:
Managing and Gaining Insight in Unstructured Data with SQL Server 2012: FileTable and Semantic Search

Learn how SQL Server 2012 is reshaping FILESTREAM functionality to enable non-transactional access to Win32 Applications and while at the same time allowing you to manipulate it equally well through SQL relational algebra with a new exciting feature called 'FileTable'. Coupled together with another exciting new feature 'Statistical Semantic Search' that allows you to extract statistically relevant phrases as potential tag recommendations, or find potentially similar content based upon these phrases, SQL Server 2012 now provides unique advances in how unstructured data can be managed and mined using database technologies.

##Title: DMVs - Understand an Application's Database Usage##
 
**Abstract**:
The DMVs contain a wealth of information about how your application uses the database.  This talk will describe how to build a tool to mine the DMVs to get a good picture of how your application uses the database, leveraging your understanding of your application and/or it’s data model.  By building a tool in a programming language, instead of relying on scripts, you can use set operations to minimize the number of queries executed against the database and then correlate information from a variety of DMVs and system tables.  For example, you can execute a single query to get the execution statistics, text and showplan xml for the top N queries and then use XPath on the client to query the showplan xml and extract a wealth of information.

##Title: SQL Server Internals  Architecture##
 
**Abstract**:
Let’s face it. You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works. Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes. But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture. This session will answer questions like: - What’s different about 32- and 64-bit systems? - What are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server? - How are queries handled behind the scenes? - What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers? - ...and much more.

##Title: Virtualizing SQL Server w/out Sacrificing Performa##
 
**Abstract**:
Everyone has heard the benefits of virtualization touted: nimble infrastructures, on-demand provisioning, and savings in cap-ex and op-ex due to service consolidation.  Most organizations have deployed some form of virtual infrastructure, in most cases resembling what folks would call a private cloud.  Administrators are trying to get as much bang for their buck as they can out of their virtual infrastructures, and as a first step, many have migrated less demanding, non-critical, or less critical services into their private cloud.  Getting to the next step often involves migrating more demanding, more critical services.

##Title: Reporting Services with SharePoint  Mobile Device##
 
**Abstract**:
Today's executives and information workers want to use mobile devices to get at their business information, make critical decisions, and thrive.  Let's help them get there with SQL Server Reporting Services and SharePoint. Tablets are common place now, and smart phones have been in place for years, but have we devoted enough attention to make effective use of the new form factors?  Let's discuss how our design approach changes when we want to launch mission-critical dashboards and reports on smaller screen sizes using touch-screen technology. We'll look at iPad and Windows Phone, SSRS and SharePoint, BI Developer and Business User, with emphasis on data visualization best practices.

##Title: Accelerate SQL data and applications over the WAN##
 
**Abstract**:
The main culprit affecting MS-SQL performance over a WAN is latency.  Latency cannot be addressed by adding bandwidth.  A different solution is needed.  Riverbed Steelhead appliances address latency issues with MS-SQL by pipelining the delivery of data between the client and the SQL server, giving up to a 10x improvement in performance.

##Title: Storage for the DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
One of the biggest issues in database performance centers around storage.  It’s also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language.  In this session, we’ll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives.   We’ll be digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, as well as RAID Groups.  
 
**Speaker(s):**
