## Title: Seven SQL Agent Jobs You Should be Running
 
**Abstract**:
See those things around your ankles? You hope they're your socks because no DBA wants to be caught with their pants down.

Whether you're an accidental DBA, a DBA who has just inherited a bunch of servers, or someone who works in a shop that won't buy monitoring tools, this session will help you get basic monitoring in place to make sure you know what's going on in your environment.

You'll learn how to implement seven simple scripts that perk their ears up and start barking like a dog after a stranger walks in the house. They are the canary in your coal mine. You'll know when backups fail, when they run longer than usual, when data files are getting full, when transaction logs have excessive VLFs, and more.

## Title: Data center migration, data centric point of view
 
**Abstract**:
Data center migrations are all the rage these days and the SQL Server DBA is one of the most important accessories. When an organization decides to change data centers, of all the very important servers that will be migrated, the ones with the company data will be the most watched. Like other projects, a good plan followed by good execution is required. In this session you’ll learn about the research, design, planning, process, and execution to migrate SQL Servers from one DC to another. I’ll go over lessons learned, whether to go it alone or brings in help, discuss pros and cons of migration techniques, big decisions like keeping the same server names, when to and not to virtualize, downtime considerations, data sync, and more.

We will discuss how to determine if indexes used by the optimizer are the optimal ones and the exceptions to the rules.   Finally we will discuss the relationship between different types of index operation and different types of join types within SQL Server including how the SQL Optimizer determines which join type it will use and pros and cons of each type.

## Title: Performance Tuning for Pirates
 
**Abstract**:
If you follow baseball you will notice that the Pittsburgh Pirates (this speaker’s favorite team) has to do more with less to be successful. This trend can also exist within IT shops. If you need to improve the performance of your SQL Server instances and cannot purchase 3rd party tools this session is for you. Learn to improve your performance tuning process by using several free tools. This session will cover wait stats, dynamic management objects, perfmon, PAL, SQL Trace, ClearTrace, SQL Nexus and SQLDiag.

## Title: Building Your First Tabular Model
 
**Abstract**:
With the release of SSAS 2012 Microsoft has introduced a new BI storage engine. In addition to the traditional OLAP engine you now have the option to build your BI models on top of the new Vertipaq engine (This is the same engine used by PowerPivot.) To use the new xVelocity engine you build a Tabular data model.  A new query language DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is used to create calculations, measures, and KPI’s. DAX is similar to the expression language used in excel and it should be easier to use than MDX and appeal to a broader audience.
This session is designed to introduce you to the process of building a tabular model in SQL Server Data Tools (BIDS rebranded).

A checklist of considerations a company would likely encounter coming from SQL Server 2005/2008 or R2. The pros and cons of in place upgrade vs. the build out new approach. There will be many real world lessons learned sprinkled in as the presenter has led many upgrades and migrations of SQL Server. Key takeaways include: when to upgrade in place compared to build new, usage of and how to gauge the usefulness of Upgrade Advisor, deprecated features and how to test for them

## Title: Defy the Defaults!
 
**Abstract**:
Installing SQL Server is easy, right? You just insert the install media, click Next a bunch of times, and you'll have a working database server in just a few minutes. At least that's what many of our non-DBA colleagues think. Not so fast, says veteran DBA Mike Hillwig. SQL Server has lots of default settings that can be potential performance killers, and we'll look at a bunch of them. These include things like where data files live, data file growth, basic security settings, and the services being installed. And while we're at it, we'll look at a bunch of the good defaults and talk about why they shouldn't be touched.

## Title: Don’t Panic DBAs! Databases on VMware Made Easy
 
**Abstract**:
Many of our customers are either virtualizing databases or planning to do so soon. We hear from many groups that attempted running their database on VMware but went back to physical hardware because of performance issues. There are many reasons this may have happened, but quite often the decision to go back to physical was not based on hard facts. This presentation will explore the fundamentals of monitoring databases running in a VMware environment. If you are using classic O/S monitoring tools, you may be getting misleading data. Understand what metrics are important and how to get to that data.

## Title: MongoDB for the Relational DBA
 
**Abstract**:
NoSQL is the buzzword of the moment, and MongoDB is the leader of the pack. Its probably running in your enterprise in production, and eventually its going to break. As a DBA its your job to fix it when it breaks, and back it up before it does.After all, there's not RELATIONAL in DBA.

On the technical side, this talk will focus on what a DBA needs to know about running MongoDB on windows. This includes setting it up as a service, importing and querying data, and of course backing up and restoring the database.

On the non-technical side, this talk will focus on when you would want to use MongoDB, and when you would not want to.

**Abstract**:
You know what your query does, but do you know how it does it?  Do you know what type of resources your query uses?  Come to this session to find the answers to these questions and more as we walk through reading execution plans.  We will see how SQL breaks down the execution of your query and what each step tells us about the overall query.  If you are newer to Microsoft SQL or you just don’t feel totally comfortable with reading execution plans, this session is for you.

## Title: Full-Text Search, it's not just for documents
 
**Abstract**:
Full-text search is an often overlooked feature of SQL Server that can be used for more than searching documents. This session will cover setting up and using full-text search to handle some of those dirty data situations we've all inherited without using the dreaded "LIKE '%text%'". As an example, we will demonstrate how full-text search can be used to find names in poorly formatted data like 'mailing address' or 'billing address' fields. It will also cover how to handle noise words that may match some names and synonyms for first names to create a really robust solution that goes beyond what could be done with plain old SQL.

## Title: Communicate for Great Good!
 
**Abstract**:
“No one knows what I do.” That’s a chief complaint of data professionals everywhere, and it’s a dangerous position to be in as well. Reviews may not be favorable, promotions more uncommon, and training dollars more rare. But by practicing written and verbal communication, new opportunities may present themselves. Blogging can land a book deal. In-house team lunch-and-learns can lead to community presentations. Most of all, good communication can be the skill that saves your job or opens the door to new horizons.

## Title: MicroORMs – Keeping Your DBA Happy
 
**Abstract**:
Developers like the reduced complexity and increased productivity that an ORM can bring while DBAs don't care for the data models that often result. Using an ORM with an existing data model is often a nightmare. But writing all of that data mapping code is such a pain! What if we could have a solution that gave us the best of both worlds and made the developers AND the DBAs happy? MicroORMs might be the answer. In this session, we’ll explore PetaPOCO, a MicroORM.
