## Title: Data Privacy and the Data Professional.
 
**Abstract**:
It’s almost a daily occurrence to hear about some sort of data breach. 
But what are the consequences of a data breach – for both the victims and companies involved – and what does that mean for you as a data professional.
As governments start to legislate more in an effort to protect the privacy of its citizens the entire concept of data storage become more complex.
Exactly what is legislation like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and how will it affect around the world.
We’re seen Microsoft give us tools over the years – like Transparent Data Encryption and Dynamic Data masking - to help with this sort of thing – but is there a better answer?
Come along to this session and hear how you and your team can lessen your chances of being the ones responsible for the next data breach.

## Title: Virtualisation and DevOps can help make your SQL Server perform!!
 
**Abstract**:
Over the years, running SQL Server inside a virtual machine has changed from being a bit of a strange and risky idea to being commonplace and offering a range of benefits: more effective distribution of load, more flexible provisioning, and allowing additional tiers of redundancy to be put in place.

Though these factors are compelling, running your database inside a virtual machine introduces an additional set of variables to worry about. 

This session will discuss industry tools that allows for configuration and optimisation of virtual servers. 

It will also show how using common DevOps principles - such as automation, monitoring and Infrastructure as Code can mitigate some of the variability in running SQL Server on a virtual host.

We'll also go over some of the things that you should be looking at within your virtual environment to ensure that you are getting the best performance out of it.

## Title: Doing it Yourself: Creating and Publishing A Power BI Custom Visual to AppSource
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI offers an incredibly extensive custom visualisation framework and the world is (almost) your oyster when it comes to what you can do. There's plenty of great visuals out there already, but what happens when you really want something that just doesn't seem to be out there and... why hasn't someone else built it yet? It can't be that hard to do... right? Can I really do it myself?

This session covers the journey of the conception and development of the Small Multiple Line Chart custom visual, some of the challenges and lessons learned along the way, and the process of self-publishing visuals through the AppSource platform for general availability in the marketplace.

## Title: Creating Custom Visualisations with Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
While Power BI comes with a lot of useful visualisations out of the box, and third-party visuals and R gives you a lot more choice, sometimes you need full control over what is being displayed. This is not for the faint hearted, as you will require Typescript and JavaScript skills and an understanding of the D3 JavaScript libraries, but there is a lot of sample code to smooth the way. This session introduces you to writing your own fully interactive custom visualisations in NodeJS, how to troubleshoot and debug, culminating in deployment of the Visual to your Power BI environment, giving you the ability to display exactly what you want in your Power BI reports.
