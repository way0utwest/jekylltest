## Title: XML and Relational Databases
 
**Abstract**:
Well established relational database principles help us decide when and how to use the XML features in SQL Server. The audience will learn what's missing from the typical understanding of first normal form ("1NF") and how to apply 1NF to XML related database design choices. If you think (like many DBAs) that XML is a curse or (like some developers) that XML is a cure-all, this presentation is for you. Contrary to typical technology presentations, this focuses on what we should do over just a list of features and syntax.

## Title: Understanding SQL Injection (DB Devs and Admins)
 
**Abstract**:
SQL injection is a term you've heard often, but do you really understand what it means for a database developer or administrator? Can’t you just leave that to the application developers to deal with?

This session will help you understand what SQL injection is, why it is a risk for your database, and how to guard against it.

This session will cover T-SQL coding best practices. The basics on how to code T-SQL statements to optimize your queries will be covered. In this session you will discover some of the common pitfalls that can cause T-SQL statements to run slow. A number of demos will be done to show how by making slight changes in your code will minimize the resources used to process your queries. From this session you will be able to take home a list of T-SQL coding guidelines to help your code more efficient T-SQL statements.

## Title: Perf Testing 2008’s Transparent Data Encryption
 
**Abstract**:
Everyone is getting hit with data security requirements. SQL 2005 introduced column-level encryption, but there are drawbacks to using it. The big security news in SQL Server 2008 is Transparent Data Encryption.

On the surface, Transparent Data Encryption seems to be a security "silver bullet". The most important feature (besides securing the data) is that it does not require any changes to your application code.

How much will TDE affect performance in an OLTP environment? This session will help you understand what TDE offers, discuss the list of caveats, and explain the performance testing and results.
