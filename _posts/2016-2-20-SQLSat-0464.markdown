## Title: Introduction to Biml  BimlScript
 
**Abstract**:
Within every Data Warehouse project there is always ETL development that is very repetitive in nature, for example, you need to import 20 different flat file exports from the ERP system, you need to load 15 dimensions into the data warehouse and so on.
With Microsoft SSIS out-of-the-box, you are forced to create multiple individual packages which is very time consuming due to the lack of easy code reuse. In a typical BI project, the ETL implementation can easily take up 60% of the project time, so it is beneficial if the development time of similar SSIS packages can be cut down.
Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) is an XML dialect for defining Business Intelligence assets across the Microsoft SQL Server platform
In this session Craig will introduce you to Biml  BimlScript, providing those new to Biml with a foundational understanding of what BIML is and what the benefits of using Biml are.

## Title: Practical Partitioning
 
**Abstract**:
What can you do when you have an ever growing database, shrinking maintenance windows and increased demands from application queries?   Enter "Table Partitioning"!  
In this session we’ll initially talk to the basics of how partitioning works, and why it may be beneficial to your database.  We’ll then demonstrate real practical methods to show how partitioning techniques can be applied to tables and the positive and negative impacts partitioning will have to your database queries and design.  We’ll then wrap up with a demonstration on leveraging partitioning for database maintenance operations such as optimisations and the implementation of partial database backups.
This session will have a strong focus on real, practical, and hands-on partitioning methods and key concepts that DBA’s can apply from Day 1.

## Title: Protecting your data in the Cloud
 
**Abstract**:
Are you concerned about moving to cloud, because of the safety of your data ? Organizations choose to go with the platform services of Azure using SQL Databases or they go with the Infrastructure services of Azure using virtual machines, in both cases security of your data is vital. This demo driven session will give you all the information you need to know about the security implementations available in SQL Databases in Azure and SQL Server. 
The session will cover the following topics with demos. Introduction to cloud adaptation of the organizations, - how enterprises adopt to the cloud and how startups are moving to the cloud.

## Title: Automated Test Driven Development with SQL Server using nUnit
 
**Abstract**:
Testing software is hard work. Testing BI solutions is even harder;there's lots of moving parts, the tools are thin and it takes a lot of time and effort. Software development uses unit testing and while this can be applied to the different parts of a BI solution, most people are more interested in the numbers the solution produces and proving that they are right.

So can you validate the numbers in your BI solution? And can you do it quickly and easily? 

In this session we will cover an approach for automating the validation of your BI solution covering multiple scenarios with a hand full of demos. We will be using nUnit as a framework and some free codeplex tools, so we can run a suite of tests every time we load data into our BI platform. This is not continuous integration, and it is not unit testing in the true sense either. It is, instead, "continuous validation", and it can provide you with an awful lot of assurance for not very much extra effort.

## Title: A Lap Around Columnstore.
 
**Abstract**:
Columnstore indexing was first introduced in SQL Server 2012.  
The technology was designed to give significant performance gains for datawarehouse queries. 
This initial version required some creative thinking to get all of the promised performance gains. This meant that adoption rates were not that high. 
However, SQL Server 2014 added significant functionality, which SQL Server 2016 builds upon. Come along and get a lap around this feature and find out how its adoption could help your organisation.
Attendees should leave this session will enough knowledge about the storage, architecture and query enhancements to implement a successful columnstore feature and administer it.

## Title: SQL Server 2016: A Monster of a Release
 
**Abstract**:
Without a doubt SQL Server 2016 will be a monster of a release. It will easily eclipse all other versions of SQL Server that have been released in scope of features, technology and breadth of vision. No wonder Gartner has positioned Microsoft as a Leader in the Magic Quadrant for Operational Database Management Systems. More importantly, Microsoft is placed furthest in vision and highest for ability to execute within the Leaders Quadrant.
In this session we will examine SQL Server 2016 and have a look at what's new in the Database Engine, Analysis Services, Reporting Services and Integration Services. We will highlight the "big ticket" items and discuss the business cases for using the technology and features.
We will also discuss Microsoft's vision for the Data Platform and how SQL Server will evolve in the future.

## Title: Introduction to Querying Cubes - Swallow the Red Pill
 
**Abstract**:
In this talk we will look at how you can get started with writing your own queries against cubes. We will start from a basis of SQL queries and compare and contrast equivalent DAX and MDX queries.

Being able to write your own queries is an important skill to know for the following reasons:
	• It makes it a lot easier to identify issues with your data,
	• It can provide a much faster way to test and develop measures, 
	• It's an extremely effective way of doing performance tuning
	• It can extended your reporting capability by providing a means of extracting data that is difficult or impossible to do with GUI tools.

As in the Matrix movie I'm inviting you to take the red pill and come with me on a journey. At the end of our session you should have an understanding of the basic concepts of querying cubes and how to get started writing your own queries.

## Title: Toolkit for DAX Optimization
 
**Abstract**:
How do you optimize a DAX expression? This session will introduce you to the useful tools to measure performance, gathering data to find the bottlenecks and helping you in writing new optimized versions of DAX. Starting from SQL Profiler, you will learn which events are relevant for DAX, and how to collect them in different environments (Analysis Services, Power Pivot, Power BI). We will show DAX Studio, which simplify and speed-up the data collection process, and makes it easy to find bottlenecks in storage engine and formula engine. VertiPaq Analyzer and other small tools will be also used to collect other useful information. The goal of the session is to provide you a methodology to analyze performance of your DAX measures, to find the bottleneck and to identify the main reason of a performance issue.

## Title: Indexing for Optimal Performance
 
**Abstract**:
An Index can be the difference between your query returning in microseconds, seconds, minutes or hours!  That makes them an incredibly powerful and often misunderstood part of the data driven application performance.  In this session we'll review if you have the right indexes, or the wrong ones.  We'll look at the internals of how indexes become fragmented and explain why this can have such a severe impact on the performance of your application and what you can do to combat that.  
  You'll leave this session with a much better understanding of how your indexes work, and the knowledge and confidence to streamline your current Index optimization procedures to take your applications to new heights of performance.

## Title: Top 10 Clustering Dos and Don'ts
 
**Abstract**:
Clustering SQL Server still vexes many in one way or another. For some, it is even worse now that both AlwaysOn features - clustered instances (FCIs) and availability groups (AGs) - require an underlying Windows Server failover cluster. Storage, networking, Active Directory quorum, and more are topics that come up quite often. Learn from one of the world's experts on clustering SQL Server some the most important items - both good and bad - that you need to do to be successful whether you are creating an FCI, AG, or combining both together in one solution.
