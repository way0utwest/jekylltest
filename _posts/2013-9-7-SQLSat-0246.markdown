## Title: Big Data in Sports
 
**Abstract**:
Big Data has arrived within elite sports organizations.  Similar to what has been observed outside of the sports industry, the typical organization struggles to make sense of how it can take advantage of Big Data and more generally, Analytics.  In addition, similar to what researchers have found, top-performing organizations are gaining a disproportionate competitive advantage from their analytics projects relative to low-performing organizations.  Using examples from his Sports Analytics consulting experiences, Mike provide insights into the use of Big Data and Analytics in the sports industry.  In addition, he will present a framework that his clients use to increase the likelihood of success with their analytics programs.

## Title: Scaling DNA Data Processing with HBase and Hadoop
 
**Abstract**:
The problem with most academic algorithms is they work well at 5, 10, or even 1000 samples, but when scaling that algorithm to handle tens of thousands of samples they simply fall apart. Ancestry.com faced this challenge after the launch of the Company’s new AncestryDNA test in 2012, which measures 700,000 markers of a users’ DNA to predict ethnicity and provide living cousin matches. To match 700,000 markers in a users’ DNA to every new 700,000 marker sample that enters the database on a weekly basis quickly creates an N-squared problem.   Ancestry.com’s scientists and engineers, ran up against the limitations of the academic algorithm GERMLINE which finds hidden family relationships within a reservoir of DNA.  Because the reference implementation of GERMLINE didn't scale, the teams worked closely together to re-conceptualize the algorithm to make it scale for hundreds of thousands of samples using Hadoop and HBase.

## Title: Getting to Step 1: Automatic Installation of Big Data, Cloud, Web and HPC Cluster 
 
**Abstract**:
Abstract: Every major big data, cloud and HPC application vendors's documentation says the same thing: "First install a cluster..." It turns out "first install a cluster," or Step 0, is a harder problem than most people expect or consider at the beginning of a big data or cloud project. Getting a consistently configured OS and applications on sometimes heterogeneous hardware can be a tedious long drawn out affair, even with Devops tools. StackIQ Rocks is based on the HPC Open Source Rocks project. It has been adapted to deploy large scale big data systems as it does for large scale HPC systems. Stackiq Rocks enables a fast efficient deployment of the entire or partial big data or cloud stack of software for RedHat variants.

## Title: Bulletproof Database Deployments
 
**Abstract**:
Have you watched a DBA's facial expression when a developer says I'm giving you an automated deployment script?  How can you assure your DBA that it won't fail?  Deployment scripts a DBA runs may also be a risk.  Saying "it worked on my machine" doesn't cut it.       

Learn strategies to ensure your schema deployment goes smooth as silk.  Including how and when to test deployment scripts, how to keep in sync with production schema changes, how to write transactional deployment scripts, how to back out schema changes with minimal data loss, and other great tips.

You'll leave with a better understanding of these techniques and how a botched database deployment can be avoided.

## Title: Hadoop Shuffle - the Magic Behind Map Reduce
 
**Abstract**:
There are numerous blogs and talks about the map reduce paradigm which explain how map reduce works at an abstract level; you've likely seen how to write a word count application in map reduce more than once. But to understand how a map reduce job will perform, you also need to know how Hadoop feeds data from the mappers to the reducers. The shuffle phase provides the glue between mappers and reducers running on different nodes, and ensures that reducers get their data in a sorted fashion. In this session, we will explain how Hadoop shuffles and sorts data. We will also talk about some practical implications this has for the performance of certain common map reduce operations, such as joins, and some of the tuning parameters that can help your map reduce applications run faster.

## Title: You Can Do That? Using Predictive Analytics To Improve Graduation Rates
 
**Abstract**:
Western Governors University (ranked 28th on the 2013 Fast Company 50 Most Innovative Companies list) has a unique educational model that creates a unique challenge. WGU pioneered competency-based, self-paced higher education. But, in a self-paced model, how can WGU know which students are struggling? If a student has done nothing in two weeks, is the student on vacation or thinking of dropping out?  In order to determine which students need help and when they need the help, WGU developed unique data capture technologies and utilized “big data” architectures and tools and a bleeding edge predictive analytics product. As a result of this work, WGU can not only identify at-risk students but also personalize the entire higher education experience for its students. In this session, Niel Nickolaisen, CIO at WGU, explains the opportunity and the specific things WGU has done to deploy accurate predictive analytics. He also explains the future of predictive analytics at WGU.

## Title: Big Data Lambda Architecture Overview
 
**Abstract**:
When most people think of processing terabytes and even petabytes of information, they often think of batch processing.  After all, processing platforms like Hadoop or Cassandra are batch-oriented.  While adding processing nodes can reduce processing latency, it does not address desired "real-time" processing requirements.  How can you process big data sets in real-time while leveraging batch-oriented Big Data infrastructure?  By example, how do services like Twitter consider the vast quantities of tweets, past and present, to provide real-time trending analytics? The answer lies within the architectural patterns of what is called Big Data Lambda Architecture.  In this session we will establish the context of the Lambda Architecture and explore the architectural patterns and practices of implementing it to provide both a low and high latency Big Data processing capability to your business.
