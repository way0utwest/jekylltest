## Title: Database DevOps with Containers
 
**Abstract**:
Unlike CI/CD pipelines for applications, we can't just delete the database and pop up a new one with each new version. Let's start with the production database, and get SQL Server content to developers in containers, and then flow schema and lookup data back into production with migration tools. You can bring the reliability and automation of CI/CD pipelines to Database DevOps with containers.

## Title: Query Store for SQL Server 2019  from zero to an hero  lessons learned from the fields .
 
**Abstract**:
Query Store is an important and recent feature in SQL Server that provides insight into the details of query execution and how that execution has changed over time. Query Store helps to identify queries that aren’t performing well, or that have regressed in their performance. Query Store provides detailed information and  wait stats that you need to resolve root causes, and it allows you to force the use of a known good execution plan. With SQL Server 2017 and later you can automate the correction of regressions in performance. 

You'll Learn
•	Best  practices in implementing Query Store on production servers
•	Detect and correct regressions in query performance
•	Lower the risk of performance degradation following an upgrade
•	Use tools and techniques to get the most from Query Store
•	Automate regression correction and other uses of Query Store.
This is  a demo session only with minimum theory  lessons from the fields   !

## Title: AWS vs. Azure: What's The Difference For A DBA?
 
**Abstract**:
Everyone has strong opinions and reactions to which cloud database platform companies should be using but how different are they, really?  What features does one cloud provider support that the other might not?  How will normal DBA activities, such as backups and restores, change depending on the cloud provider your company uses?  Join me in this session as I share my migration stories and discuss the results of my research about how AWS and Azure are different and how many of my daily tasks and tools changed as our company migrated to AWS.  Come and listen as I share what I have learned on this journey from on-premises to the cloud.  Join me and find out which platform I would use.

## Title: Climbing the SQL Server B-Tree
 
**Abstract**:
You’ll find a lot of Word of Mouth (WOM) advice out there about SQL Server performance, especially when it comes to indexes. Some of the things you have probably heard are: 

• keep clustered index width small 
• unique indexes perform better 
• keep non-clustered index width small 
• compressed indexes have fewer logical reads 
• add one index for each column 

But how do you know if this advice is good or bad? Did you know that there is a way to look under the hood at the actual index pages to see how the data is stored, and how it’s stored differently when data is compressed? Using this information, you can prove or disprove the WOM advice. 

Attend this demo-heavy session to learn how the SQL Server optimizer uses indexes. It’s all about performance, and the right indexes will give your application a big performance advantage.

## Title: Code Smells - How to Keep Your Code From Stinking!
 
**Abstract**:
Maybe you’ve had some experience writing SQL, but no one’s ever told you what not to do. Or maybe you’re aware of some bad habits to avoid when writing SQL, but no one has ever shown you why a bad practice can hurt your query – or SQL Server.  Perhaps you feel a little more confident with your TSQL, but don’t understand why your queries aren’t running as quickly as you would like.

Bad SQL coding practices are known in the SQL community as “code smells”.  Sign up for this hour-long workshop where you will work with me through five common coding mistakes that can make performance stink. By the time we’re done, you’ll have a better idea of how to freshen up some problem queries.

## Title: Notebooks 101 for SQL People
 
**Abstract**:
Are you a database developer, a DBA or a data analyst? Do you find spending quite a bit of time trying to reproduce analysis or reproduce issues and the troubleshooting techniques? This Notebooks 101 session is for you!

The lack of rigor in being able to reproduce analysis in business context or to reproduce data troubleshooting can lead to confusion and time wasted on work that had been previously done. With Notebooks, Data Professionals can share their techniques and data sources used for the data analysis or troubleshooting for code review and reproducible insights/troubleshooting. 

Azure Data Studio Notebooks support SQL and KQL natively with intellisense; with easy to use charting capabilities. With Notebooks and Jupyter Book (collection of Notebooks) in Azure Data Studio, it’s also easy now for your team to build an onboarding guide (user manual) / documentation on data sources, useful sample scripts and tutorials.

## Title: SQL Server Configuration with dbatools and dbachecks
 
**Abstract**:
Automating the configuration of SQL Server instances and being able to check the configuration for standard configuration is an important role for any DBA when you have lots of instances.  But how can we automate the configuration easily?  How can we check to make sure the proper configuration is in place and hasn’t changed?

In this session, we will look at how to configure your SQL Server Instances using PowerShell and the dbatools module.  Then we will look at how to use dbachecks to confirm the configuration of our instances and how to check for changes in the future of the configuration. 
 
Attendees will see how easy it is to use PowerShell via dbatools to configure their SQL Server instances.  Attendees will see how easy it is to use PowerShell via dbachecks and PowerBI to see if their servers are configured properly.  Attendees will be given a set of scripts that take back to use to configure and test the configuration of their SQL Server instances.

## Title: Basic Data Modeling for BI Reporting
 
**Abstract**:
We all start using business intelligence tools by using a single dataset, like a flat file.  Then, we hit a plateau in our learning curve, or we add a second flat file into our BI product, and we get incorrect results.  One reason is that we haven't modeled our solution correctly.

In order to move to the next level of our journey along the BI learning curve, we need to understand how a tool like Power BI works.  Only then will we understand why we design our data models the way we do.

In this session, we will review how tools like Power BI work under the covers and how that impacts the way we construct our data models.  This is an introductory level course, so we will not get too technical, just enough to get us to the next level and moving back up that learning curve!

## Title: A Deep Dive into Execution Plans  How to Use Them!
 
**Abstract**:
The SQL Server Query Optimizer creates an execution plan for every statement running in the database. Since SQL is a declarative language, we describe what data we want to see, then the SQL Server Optimizer figures out a plan to retrieve that data efficiently.  However, sometimes the Optimizer chooses a bad query plan which not only makes the query run slow, but eats up resources so other processing can’t get done.  

This presentation will show how to read and fine tune the query plan for better performance. We’ll quickly go over the different types of execution plans and when to use them. We’ll examine the different operators, their statistics and costs, then determine which steps to focus on tuning.  Finally, several trouble shooting techniques will be shown so you can increase your tuning skills.

Hi there! My name is Pam Mooney. The road to IT was a long and winding one for me, but I fell in love with SQL Server and knew that I wanted to be a DBA after my first database class in college.I was fortunate enough to be hired in as a Junior DBA straight out of school, and I have never looked back. I’m now a Senior DBA who loves to mentor and teach – as well as to continue to learn. A one-time, part-time professional musician and songwriter, I have a medical background and am a passionate history nerd. In my spare time, I like to hike, bike, read, go to the Ren Faire, write, and talk to you.
