## Title: REAL WORLD REPORT SERVER PERFORMANCE SOLUTIONS AND STRATEGIES
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will cover the best strategies to track SQL Server Reporting Services performance and the methods to improve report performance. We will cover methods of tracking report performance through sys.dm_exec_procedure_stats and other DMVs, leveraging the ReportServer catalog ExecutionLog3 view, and monitoring Reporting Services using performance monitor (perfmon). We will analyze this information through T-SQL queries in SSMS and PowerView analysis. We will also cover methods of rolling these solutions into a warehouse report using SSRS / SSIS to monitor report performance over time. We will discuss when to scale out the Report Server and when to focus on the SQL Server queries driven through SSRS report execution. 

We will cover methods of isolating Report Server performance and we will cover how to create your own SSMS Dashboard Report with KPIs on SSRS and SQL Server Performance.

This session is a must for both DBAs and report developers.

## Title: The DW and Big Data Architecture
 
**Abstract**:
The problem with the old way of organizing and analyzing data in RDBMS is that it is painfully slow, incomplete and costly. We are obligated to be selective and work with data in small chunks. In the best case scenario we have been partitioning our data and archiving it with the hope to eventually use it. The fact is that when data is being archived, usually, it is never being used again. We didn’t even bother with collecting all the data due to economics and technical limitations. 
The same that in the dawn of the relational revolution, the RDBMS created a new way of handling data that allowed doing it in better ways. The new breed of Big Data Management Systems BDMS, such as Cloudera and Hortonworks, are opening new possibilities to handle the renegaded and invisible data of the enterprise making possible to think about a new world, the “internet of everything”
In my presentation I will explain advantages and disadvantages of OLTP, OLAP and Big Data and the Big Data impact in the D

## Title: T-SQL Performance Guidelines for better DB stress powers
 
**Abstract**:
To reach your desired business functionalities, it can be easy using some common T-SQL practices like MTVF , scalar functions , Temp tables, Union…etc and they might perform pretty well on development server coz neither adequate stress of users or adequate volume of data  is exists there but actually they seem totally strange once going to live and they become performing badly ending up with standstill cases sometimes , this is due to lack of stress powers of T-SQL codes which should be considered largely for critical mission DBs so I am going to talk to you about How to capture expensive queries using different techniques ..?and How to optimize them in the shortest time using scientific ways ..? (10 different T-SQL Practices will be analyzed within this session)

## Title: Mission Possible: Interactive Performance Troubleshooting - Indexes
 
**Abstract**:
Performance troubleshooting is detective work. We'll have a lab system being assaulted by PowerShell scripts  (to simulate live users), and simulated performance problems like those that can make your on-call cell phone ring too much! Do you think you have what it takes to find these "needle in the haystack" issues and resolve them quickly?  This will be a highly interactive session where we will locate the rogue queries together, work through solutions, implement them and measure the results.  In this episode we'll focus primarily on improper indexing as a common underlying problem and all will walk away with much better troubleshooting skills and an upgraded knowledge of performance tuning!

## Title: How To Build A SQL Server Virtual Lab On Your Own Machine
 
**Abstract**:
As the number of SQL Server versions and features grow over time so does the difficulty in maintaining a set of tools for working with all of them on your local machine. Add in that some features require multiple physical instances and suddenly a single installation isn't enough. Need to quickly switch between versions and editions of SQL Server? Want to learn how to set up an AlwaysOn Availability Group? Or maybe you want to try out the latest features in SQL 2014...virtualization offers a convenient way to do any and all of these. In this session we'll show you how by covering the fundamentals of desktop virtualization and demonstrating how to set up a virtual lab on your own machine.

## Title: SQL Server Internals and Architecture
 
**Abstract**:
Let’s face it.  You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works.  Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes.  But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture.  This session will answer questions like:
-       What are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server?
-       How are queries handled behind the scenes?
-       What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers?
-       What happens during checkpoints?  Lazywrites?
-       How are IOs handled with regards to transaction logs and database?
-       What happens when transaction logs and databases grow or shrinks?

## Title: Introducing Cube World To Users From Flat Table Land
 
**Abstract**:
This session explores the tabular approach to building cubes in SQL Server Analysis Services 2012 for those DBAs and developers who are more comfortable working with relational databases than cubes. Starting with a ‘normal’ relational database, the attendee will learn how to build a basic model by loading data from several data sources, establish relations between these data sources, define measures and dimensions, build hierarchies, create KPIs and deploy functional cubes that can be used to answer management’s questions about what is really going on with their data. For users already familiar with PowerPivot, this session provides a good transition into the world of SSAS as both use essentially the same techniques.

## Title: From Query to Disk: Managing your queries, data distribution, and environment for best performance
 
**Abstract**:
The 'out of the box' SQL Server installation and configuration is generally useless in an enterprise of any size and will lead to unbelievably poor query performance. In this hour we will discuss the basics of SQL Server deployment and configuration, the tools at your disposal to optimize query execution, and some tricks to make your queries perform at their best...all from the 'magic wand' approach where we start with 'most optimal' then adjust as necessary to suit the circumstances. Expect to learn a little bit of everything...from SQL Server deployment and configuration to indexing and statistics to stored procedures and functions to query design to database architecture.

## Title: We Don't Need Roads:A Look Into SQL Server Indexes
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever ran a SQL against SQL Server and it was so slow that you wondered if the database was from 1955? You could use a Delorean or you can create indexes in your database.  This session will introduce you to SQL Server indexes.  Indexes are a powerful tool to improve the performance of our queries. We'll discuss how indexes are structured and why they speed up queries, how INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries are affected by indexes and how to identify if an index is necessary. Then, we'll take a look at an Entity Framework application and see how EF reacts to our fresh new indexes. If you want to make bad query performance a thing of the past this session is for you.

## Title: What are you Waiting For?
 
**Abstract**:
Using Wait Types and Response Time Analysis techniques is a often underutilized method for tuning SQL Server instances and applications. As a result, there is often confusion on exactly what the data means. The issue typically centers around the fact the response time data is analyzed at the wrong level and is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using SQL Server wait type data coupled with response time based performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues.

## Title: Best Practices to Awesome Performance on VMware
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server on VMware???  Most of our customers have virtualized their application tier, and now are either virtualizing databases or planning to do so soon. Some companies have tried to virtualize databases on VMware, but went back to physical hardware because of performance issues. There are many reasons this may have happened, but quite often the decision to go back to physical was not based on hard facts. This presentation will explore the fundamentals of monitoring databases running in a VMware environment. If you are using classic O/S monitoring tools using standard Perfmon counters, you are getting misleading information. Understand which metrics are important and how to get the data.

## Title: AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
 
**Abstract**:
In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic fail-over using a real web app to see how well this feature works.

## Title: Hello, My Name Is DAX
 
**Abstract**:
For anyone doing serious work with PowerPivot, you know that you must sometimes create additional columns calculated from the data in your existing data sources.  If your data source is SQL Server, you could do this in SQL directly by just connecting to a custom view.  However, for most other data sources (and for those users without develo9pment access to SQL Server) the best alternative is building expressions in PowerPivot to define new columns. DAX is also used to join tables on multiple columns and to create calculated measures.  This session will explore DAX functions and expressions and how they differ from Excel expressions.
