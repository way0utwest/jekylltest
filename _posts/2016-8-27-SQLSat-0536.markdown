## Title: Hybrid BI
 
**Abstract**:
With the introduction of SQL 2016 and all its new features, Hybrid BI is more in focus then ever. Doing BI is no longer bound to be on-premise or in the cloud. With all the new features and the Azure platform Microsoft has made it easier then ever to implement a hybrid platform.

When working with a hybrid platform your organisation will be able to select strategy and features based on the highest ROI. During this session I will go through three different aspects of Hybrid BI which is infrastructure, data-storage and reporting. 

As part of this i will go through the advantages and disadvantages of each area to supply you with the information you need to choose the right direction for your platform.

## Title: Unicorn safari - alleviating consolidation pains with SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
Database consolidation was once described to me as a bit of a mix between the holy grail and a unicorn. Not that difficult in theory, but have a way of getting very messy in practice. SQL Server 2016 brings several new features to simplify the whole process, and hopefully provide the DBA and the people footing the license bill some sorely needed respite.
This presentation will outline the classic issues with consolidation of small and medium-sized databases and explore what new pain relief SQL Server 2016 brings to the table.
At the end of this session you will have a good understanding of the challenges and solutions available in SQL Server for solving consolidation workloads.

## Title: Making Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking work for you!
 
**Abstract**:
Azure SQL DB has had Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking for a while now, SQL Server 2016 brings that on-premises. But just how can you use it, what changes do you need to make to your model to get the most from it?

These new features have the potential to really improve application security, especially in compliance scenarios. Pushing the security restrictions down into the database layer has many benefits, notably only the data needed leaves the database. But there are a number of gotchas that you need to be aware of that can really mess up performance if you get them wrong.

In this session we will look at how you can get the most out of these features and retain the performance of your system.

## Title: Mastering DML Operations like a master
 
**Abstract**:
DML operations mean lot of work for the database engine of Microsoft SQL Server. Understanding the details of a DML transaction may give you great benefits when planning workloads for INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE operations.

Come and learn the differences of space allocation/deallocation between Clustered Indexes and Heaps in this demo oriented session. It will answer these questions:

What is the difference of data page allocation for heaps and clustered indexes?
What is the amount of transaction log when you update data in a heap and/or in a clustered index?
What are the differences when data are delete from a heap and clustered index?
Can ETL processes be improved by usage of the right strategy for INSERTS and DELETES?
What performance drawbacks have Page Splits and Forwarded Records for my application design?

## Title: Why (data) quality matters
 
**Abstract**:
Poor data quality has a cost. 
Examples of data quality challenges and their impact.
Having correct data is very important to make correct decisions. 
Data quality goes hand in hand with proper data modelling.
Knowledge about use cases and workload is important input to your data modelling. 
Different kinds of compression can be relevant depending on your usage scenario.
Storing data economically also means that data should be easy to use. 
Having focus on deadlines whithout having (data) quality in mind will hit you hard at an later point in time.

Delivering good query performance and reports in time is important to business users,
but how to measure it from their perspective?

And obviously the features you provide should work. 
This is where you benefit from unit testing. (Demo of unit testing with SSDT.)

## Title: Who, What, When. Monitoring usage of your MS BI stack
 
**Abstract**:
You have created great cubes and Reporting Services reports but how do you know if it is being used? Learn how to set up the collection of the usage data and how you can use this data in your decision making. 

We will talk about how to collect the data, how to build something meaningful from the data and how you can report on top of the data. We will do this for OLAP cubes and for Reporting Services Reports and we will explore ways you can further develop this for your own organization.

At the end of the session all participants will leave with all the code as well as the know how to get started with the collection of usage statistics for their Microsoft BI Solutions

## Title: Shadow prediction: SQL spatial data types and astronomy well mixed
 
**Abstract**:
In the Wind turbine industry it is often desirable to know where a wind turbine casts its shadow as it can case annoyance to neighbours.
This session is supposed to be a more entertaining then practical exercise to combine scarsely used data types in unusual fashion, combined with a bit of astronomy and math, to calculate and visualize the relationship between sun and wind turbine purely by using SQL2016 Management Studio. 

The calculation of the daily path of a shadow can be seen as a rather complex three-dimensional problem. By turning around the perspective and 'painting' the picture of turbines in the sky this can be decribed as a much simpler two-dimensional problem on a sphere. For this the geography data type will be used and in turn the richness of its functionality demonstrated. Even a sufficient visualisaton is included in SSMS 2016.  Apart from 2-3 formulas everything will be handeled in SQL and no complex math is needed.

## Title: SS2014/2016 In-Memory Tables --Formula One Performance Unleashed???
 
**Abstract**:
Query performance is what it is all about.  SQL Server 2014 now has the new in-memory functionality that takes a completely different approach to data access and manipulation.  This session will consolidate the relevant information from all these sources so the production DBA/Developer will be able to understand, create, use, maintain, and trouble-shoot in-memory table functionality.  This session will also examine several demo scripts showing performance gains using the in-memory tables with and without columnstore indexes over equivalent disk based tables.  
This session is all about when and how to apply in-memory tables in a production environment.
After this session you will
1.	 Understand what in-memory tables are and how to create and maintain them including their limitations
2.	Be able to identify performance gains over equivalent disk back tables
3.	Comprehend the new data monitoring needed for in-memory table

## Title: GIving Permissions through Stored Procedures
 
**Abstract**:
You probably know that with a stored procedure you can permit users to access or update data even if they have no direct permissions on the table. But you may have noticed that this does not work when the SP uses dynamic SQL. 

In this session you will learn why it is so and techniques how you can use to overcome this. You will also learn that the same techniques can be to permit users to perform specific actions they need to do without granting them general high-level permissions on database or server level by packaging these actions into a stored procedure. You will also learn why should should be careful with setting a database TRUSTWORTHY.

The session should be of interest both to DBAs and application developers that need to consider advanced permissions in their stored procedures.

## Title: Tools and Tips: From Accidental to Efficient Data Warehouse Developer
 
**Abstract**:
You have probably heard about the Accidental DBA, but what about the Accidental Data Warehouse developer? We stumbled into the world of data warehousing, learned dimensional modeling and work with T-SQL and SSIS daily. We are masters of googling solutions to our problems and make sure our ETL processes run without errors. We deliver data to business users... but we rarely deliver data as fast as we want.

You might not be able to rewrite your entire Data Warehouse or change your team's processes over night, but there are many things you can do to increase your own productivity and become a more efficient Data Warehouse developer.

In this session I will show you some of what I have learned and discovered that has made me exclaim "Oh wow! Why did I not know this yesterday!?" - including SSMS features, tools for query analysis and tuning, free tools and scripts, Biml for SSIS and even a couple of things I used to think were only useful for those scary DBAs.

## Title: Dimensional Modeling Design Patterns: Beyond the Basics
 
**Abstract**:
Dimensional modeling is one of cornerstones of successful Business Intelligence initiatives. Even with new technologies like PowerPivot and Analysis Services Tabular models, you need to represent your organization’s data in a way that is accessible for end users and IT staff alike. An effective dimensional model will also ensure that your data warehouse or data mart will be responsive and capable of accommodating emerging requirements.
In this session, we will dive deeper into the art of dimensional modeling. We will look at how and when to create the different types of fact and dimension tables, Including patterns for enriching dimensional data, creating usable hierarchies for efficient navigation, and tracking historical changes. After attending this session you will be able to confidently assess the quality of your organization’s dimensional model and recommend and implement changes. Bring your toughest quandaries to help make this an interactive and engaging session.
