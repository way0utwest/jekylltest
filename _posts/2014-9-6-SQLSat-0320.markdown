## Title: SQL 2012 Table Compression
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2008 has introduced Table compression to the DBA toolkit. We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server. What some may not know is the subtleties of compression. Such subtleties include that not all Page Compressed tables are entirely page compressed. This session will show you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level. At the lower level, this session will also show how to determine compression settings of objects in the database. Participants will be able to use undocumented commands as well as commands such as PIVOT to derive some interesting information from the database engine.

## Title: The Froogle DBA – Combining SQL Features and Open Source
 
**Abstract**:
There are some really great toolsets for sale to help you manage your SQL Server environment.  If you want to learn more about them, then this is not the session for you.  While there is nothing wrong with buying a solution to solve your needs.  The Froogle DBA has a recipe for combining free software with built in SQL Server features to put together a framework that will give you the peace of mind you need to sleep at night.  That’s right, no software licensing needed beyond your SQL Server investment and you too could be maintaining and monitoring your systems with the best of them.
We’ll be combining Zenoss, MDW, CMS, and Performance Dashboard Reports to build a comprehensive monitoring and management framework in place.  With this flexible framework you will be able to keep systems up and sleep easier.

## Title: What Just Happened? Why You Need to Constantly Monitor Your Environment
 
**Abstract**:
You get back from lunch on a Friday and your inbox is exploding with emails from the users claiming the system is hanging. What do you do now? How are you going to figure out what is currently causing the issue and what started the problem in the first place? 

In this session you'll learn why it’s important to monitor what your server is doing and track any changes that have been made. You’ll learn about the components you can use to create your own solution as well as some real world examples of how correct monitoring can help you troubleshoot day-to-day issues. You’ll also see how it can help the new DBA get a grip on what’s going on in their environment. 

Full-time monitoring can provide you with quick answers to many common issues; such as “random” system slow-downs, deadlocks, and that pesky SQL error the users see once every two months. Having a great infrastructure in place can leave you with more time for the fun stuff, like online training and post-lunch power naps.

## Title: Data Analysis for the DBA - Performance and Audit Reporting
 
**Abstract**:
Sometimes you really need to see what your SQL Server is truly capable of doing. You need to find the bottlenecks on performance that could prevent you from adding additional workloads, more users or more databases, whether you are in a virtual or physical environment and regardless of your SQL Server version. But first you have to know what is happening under the hood right now. In this session we will look at how to load test SQL Server while monitoring the important performance metrics and then extrapolate from that data what would happen if you added more users.  We might even cover how to automate this process for other servers. We will also dive into PowerView and SSRS to see how they compare on delivering appealing visualizations of the collected data.

## Title: Your Free Tools Swiss-Knife for SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
A lot like fancy gadgets but those do not come for cheap and sometimes we do not even need them and you do not need expensive 3rd party tools to do many tasks with SQL server.

I want to share with you my Swiss-knife of free tools that I use almost daily to work with SQL server. From SQL Nexus , PAL,Qure Analyzer, PSSDiag , and more ;some help with productivity and some cut the time needed to troubleshoot an issue.

Those are powerful, free and easy to use tools to help you with your daily work. I would like also to hear from you if you are using any other tools that you find useful and save you time and cost even if they are not free so please come.

## Title: Twice in a Lifetime: T-SQL Refactoring 101
 
**Abstract**:
Whether it's because you inherited the code from the "last guy," or your stored procedures haven't been looked at since the database was created in 2001, there will come a time when you need to rewrite old code. When you start this project you may ask yourself, how did I get here? And you may ask yourself, how do I work this? This is not my beautiful database. This is not my beautiful T-SQL. Letting the data go by, information flowing to the end users is the goal. Refactoring old code can be tedious, but necessary. Sometimes it isn't just about identifying the worst queries in your application, but figuring out how to rewrite everything to introduce the best practices that the last guy didn't know about five years ago. 

This session will cover ways to quickly find old T-SQL antipatterns, tools that can help make things easier to update code, and deprecated features that can't be used in modern versions of SQL Server. Don't leave your old T-SQL the same as it ever was.

## Title: Automated Deployments - Lowering the risk of database releases
 
**Abstract**:
Releasing changes can feel like the most stressful part of managing databases. Whether we're in a development shop reviewing changes from several unique development instances, a healthcare shop walking a series of changes through an extreme change management process, or the only DBA pushing manual changes into production, hitting that final button is stressful.

In this session, we'll build a deployment pipeline that will reduce the stress and risks we're used to from manual deployments while providing a framework for cleaner change tracking and management, shorter release windows, and the ability to keep numerous environments in sync with the latest available changes without constant restores. While the primary focus will be an end-to-end demo, we'll also discuss the business value of deployment pipelines, how they reduce risk and enable us to move faster, and alternatives to the set of tools used in the demo.

## Title: Scalable, Large-Volume Data Synchronization in OLTP Systems
 
**Abstract**:
Synchronizing data from any external source (file, web form, web service, etc.) poses problems as the data volume and/or transaction count increases. While a data warehouse might have a regular window in which to ETL its data, an OLTP system--especially one that serves a 24 / 7 / 365 business--has to deal with issues such as concurrency, disk space, and even memory management on the app server. And the processing still needs to be done ASAP.  Various methods will be discussed to synchronize tens of thousands and up to millions of rows quickly, with very little app-memory used, and all while performing validations and transformations.

## Title: SQL Server on VMWare Monitoring:  Optimized for Performance
 
**Abstract**:
Your SQL Server instance has been placed on a VMWare virtualized machine (VM), now what.    When a SQL Server instance moved to a virtualized architecture, the DBA typically loses visibility to CPU, Memory, Storage and network metrics.    This session will cover basic virtualization concepts specifically related to VMWare,  VMWare tools, as well as discuss specific tools to help restore the visibility of server metrics and correlate those metrics directly to SQL Server performance.   Monitoring the server metrics along with monitoring overall SQL Server performance provides for an effective solution to manage  monitor your SQL Server/VMWare virtualized environment.

## Title: What can SQLCLR do for you?
 
**Abstract**:
Most articles and blog entries regarding SQLCLR are focused on how to write functions or stored procedures, but very little time is spent on showing what SQLCLR does really well and where it can be truly beneficial. Here we will explore the what / why / when of using SQLCLR to accomplish things that cannot be done in T-SQL, such as: Dynamic SQL, error handling, and calling Stored Procedures within functions; capturing PRINT output; Custom Aggregates; multi-threading; and more. We will look at practical examples of using SQLCLR to reduce code complexity, reduce the time it takes to complete a project, increase performance, and assist in automation (i.e. stay within T-SQL instead of using SSIS or xp_cmdshell).

## Title: Optimizing Protected Indexes
 
**Abstract**:
As a SQL Server DBA I see my role having 2 main focuses. First is to protect the data and second is to ensure performance is maximized. More often than not companies forget about data security when they focus on performance tuning. In this presentation I will mention a few cases where encryption could have saved a lot of hassle. I will then demo a method that can be used to "index" commonly searched on encrypted values (ex: SSNs, Credit Card, etc) helping reduce the impact on the performance of a query.

## Title: Getting Started With Execution Plans
 
**Abstract**:
Are you just breaking into the query tuning side of managing your SQL Servers?  In this session, we will cover the basics you need to start leveraging execution plans as part of your tuning process.  We will discuss how SQL Server creates and uses plans, and how to collect them.  Once we have the plans, we will go step-by-step through how to read them, and what the most common operators mean.  We will look at the different types of operators not just from a standpoint of what they do, but how they can impact query performance.  We will also cover how good database design and maintenance allow you to get better execution plans through having the right indexes and up-to-date statistics.

## Title: Crazy Things That Developers Do
 
**Abstract**:
Throughout my career, I've seen developers do some pretty crazy things to databases (and truth be told, I've done some of these myself!). Come to this session to learn what we do (from opening up the database to SQL Injection attacks, how SQL can use Referential Integrity to optimze queries, and the pitfalls of using NOLOCK), why it's bad to the database server (or your career)... and alternatives that can be used instead. Trust me... your DBA will love you for making these changes.

## Title: "I Know What You Did Last Query" --SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Starting with the 2005 release, SQL Server captures information about the workload on an instance, which you can use to monitor the system, gather performance metrics, and validate system settings.  This information is available via Dynamic Management View and functions and officially they "return internal, implementation-specific state data." This session gives an introduction to these concepts, how they make DBA life much sweeter and we discuss many of the different community queries available to help you get jump started in your environment.  We also open up the floor for ideas of how you are using these views/functions.

## Title: Understanding Transaction Isolation Levels
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server offers several isolation levels beyond the default "READ COMMITTED".  But understanding when to use each one can be daunting.  Whether you are a developer who needs to understand how isolation works and  and why NOLOCK is not an appropriate hint in most cases, or a seasoned DBA who needs to understand the less commonly used isolation methods, this session is for you.  We will look at each level, how it impacts the engine, and examine appropriate (and inapproriate) use cases for each.

## Title: F# Type Providers Change The Way You Interact With Data Sources
 
**Abstract**:
F# is the functional language that ships with Visual Studio.  It is a great language that combines the power of functional programming with the benefits of being a 1st class citizen in the .NET stack.  One feature unique to F# is type providers.  Type providers are constructs to allow you to dynamically connect and consume data sources ranging from Sql Server to Json to Hadoop to MongoDb and everything in between.  Type providers are particularly useful analyzing very large datasets where it is impossible to code-gen the schema.  They are also very useful for developers who want to write fewer bugs.

## Title: Getting the Most Out of Plan Reuse
 
**Abstract**:
Both DBA’s and Developers should be acutely aware of what it takes to ensure that every call to SQL Server has the best chance of reusing a previously generated query plan. Having to generate a new plan each time will waste precious resources and ultimately prevent you from obtaining peak performance and scalability for that SQL Server Instance. We will cover the fundamentals of how query plans get reused and how you need to write your code to take advantage of that. Lots of demos will show just how critical some of your code choices can be in order to obtain peak performance.

## Title: The 20-Minute Tabular Model
 
**Abstract**:
The Tabular model is the new kid on the block in Analysis Services 2012. Based on xVelocity, a new highly compressed in-memory technology, Tabular models promise considerable performance improvements over Multidimensional models in many scenarios. But, as is the case with any new technology, there are certain limitations of which to be aware. Join me in this introductory-level session focusing on how Tabular fits into the Microsoft BI stack, the major factors to consider when choosing between Tabular and Multidimensional technologies, and finally a live demo where we'll build a basic Tabular model in visual studio.

## Title: PowerShell  SQL Management Objects: automated sql server installs and configurations
 
**Abstract**:
Creating new SQL servers is a time-intensive process.  Beyond the Next, Next, Next of the initial install are the multitude of configuration details unique to your environment.   Maintenance Jobs, alerts, min/max memory,  operators, dbmail, audits and the list goes on.  In this presentation we will go over basic PowerShell syntax and PowerShell SQL Management Objects (SMO), resulting in a set of reusable scripts for automating the installation and configuration of new SQL servers.

## Title: Goodbye Next Next Next, Hello Automated Installs
 
**Abstract**:
Tired of clicking through all those setup screens and entering the same information over and over again? I know I am, so I'm doing something about it...I'm automating my installs!  From base SQL Server installs to Service Packs, Cumulative Updates and even Client Tools for DBA's and Developers, I'll show you ways to automate your installs using SQL Server FineBuild (CodePlex Project).  We'll cover many of the scenarios you may encounter and you'll walk away with some pre-built install scripts to help get you started.

## Title: SSIS Templates Can Make Your Life Easier
 
**Abstract**:
How many times have you started a new SSIS project and added the same components that you’ve added to almost every other package you’ve created?  Components to handle logging and errors or even a standard workflow for loading data files.  In this session I’ll show you how you can create standard templates that already contain any and all of the common components you desire.  We’ll also look at how to implement and use these templates so that the next time you create a SSIS package you can spend your time on the work you actually need to do instead of implementing common components over and over again.
