## Title: SQL Server Internals:  It's What's for Dinner!
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wondered what happens under the hood when you query your SQL Server database? Well, it’s somewhat like asking for a special meal for dinner. During this session, I will use a chef analogy to describe the life cycle of a query and the journey it takes through SQL Server’s working parts. By comparing the concepts of SQL Internals to a familiar idea, you will have a clear understanding of the underlying processes involved in returning data from a SELECT query. Once we’ve established a frame of reference for a simple read operation, we’ll look at an UPDATE statement and consider the additional factors associated with a write operation.  By session's end you should have a clear overview of what happens when a query hits your server.

## Title: The Accidental Programmer
 
**Abstract**:
 	Most people in the database world have heard of the term, "The Accidental DBA", those programmers who have to work with databases. How about the other side of the coin? What about DBA's an Dev's who have to write code or have to work closely with programmers? This presentation is a best practices guide for working with SQL Server in a .Net environment. You will learn how to recognize when bad code is written that interacts with the database, how to track it down, and most importantly how to fix it. On top of that you will also receive an introduction to object oriented programming concepts such as data abstraction, encapsulation, tier architecture, and class objects so that you can better communicate with your programmers.

## Title: Disk IO Tuning for Microsoft SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Tuning disk subsystems for optimal SQL Server performance is typically the domain
of very experienced, enterprise DBAs. It normally requires years of experience the hard disk
subsystem to learn exactly what configurations perform best, provide the greatest fault tolerance,
and allow for the most scalability. This session removes the need for those years of experience
by answering questions like:

How does RAID compare to SAN, hard disk to SSD?
What is needed to properly monitor and tune the performance of my disk subsystem?
How do I tune my SQL Server for improved IO performance?

Configuring hardware can be very intimidating, especially when the application needs to scale.

## Title: SSAS 2012 Tabular vs. Multidimensional
 
**Abstract**:
The Analysis Services 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI. BI professionals can implement Multidimensional cubes, or they can deploy Tabular models developed by business users to a dedicated server. Those new to Tabular, or those embarking upon BI for the first time with Analysis Services 2012, may find it difficult to choose between the two paths. In this session, BI Architect and MVP Bill Pearson overviews the nature and design goals of each option, comparing Multidimensional and Tabular features. He then offers guidance on selecting the appropriate model, providing real world examples to illustrate approaches for given scenarios.

## Title: Backups  Restores: You’re Not In Kansas Anymore!
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever been in Kansas and have a random house drop on you?  Ok, probably not, but the moral of the question is that you never know when a house might fall out of the sky and you certainly don't want to be caught under it when it does!.  Not understanding database backups  restores is just like having a house crash down on around your ears.  Loud, noisy and sometimes hard to put the pieces back together.  As a follower of the Yellow Database Road, You have to be ready for said event.  Now how do you do that you ask?  You come to this session about Backups  Restores.  We'll talk about how to use them to help avoid having a house fall on your head!

## Title: How to be a DBA and retire Rich
 
**Abstract**:
Yes, how to be a DBA and retire rich.  This is a session in the ‘off the beaten path’ or the ‘miscellaneous track’.  You will learn nothing SQL Server technical in this session, but will learn about the Modern Portfolio Management theory in Finance.  I will conduct a practical discussion on how to structure your 401(K) portfolio or your general investment portfolio for the most optimal asset allocation and maximum return while minimizing taxes and expenses.  You can use the practical tips in this session to consider options to streamline your portfolio to maximize returns.  This session may serve as a wakeup call to do something about your portfolio.  When it comes to retirement, clearly, luck is not a strategy.

## Title: Serene Velocity: Reporting Services and SSAS Data
 
**Abstract**:
SSRS 2008 R2 provides powerful capabilities to help us develop sophisticated reports from Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services. Unfortunately, many of these features, such as the server aggregation function, are commonly ignored by report developers. The result: redundant work in the reporting layer. In this session, BI Architect and MVP Bill Pearson exposes ways to optimize reporting from SSAS by writing MDX that leverages, rather than replicates, what the cube is designed to do best.

## Title: Top 10 Admin Mistakes on SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on
the market. But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy. And it doesn’t mean that
database administration on SQL Server is problem free. And since SQL Server is constantly
growing from small, home-grown applications, many IT professionals end up encountering issues
that others had tackled and solved years ago. Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails
of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again. In
fact, wouldn’t you like to learn about those mistakes before they ever happen?
