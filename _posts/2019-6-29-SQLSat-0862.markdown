## Title: Performance Dreams started at SQL Server 2014 and came true now at SQL Server 2016,2017
 
**Abstract**:
“Performance Dreams started at SQL Server 2014 and came true now at SQL Server 2016,2017 “, it is just like this because you there are unbelievable performance reads and substantial improvements that can drive your DB environment to a distinct level of stability and Performance to be a leading environment in a very short time ..! It looks like apparently a myth or legend to see those new SQL Server 2016 features how they could flipped up SQL Server Powers from the old generation to the new generation of in-advanced analytics using In-memory and CCI (Colmnstore indexes) where no longer need for any DWH solutions at all but just reading data directly from production DBs with ZERO performance impacts on end users  ..! come in here to my session and you will know more about many new features and rich powers of SQL Server 2014  2016 regarding performance particularly like  Microsoft project “Hekaton” for In-memory built in for OLTP , CCI( columnstore index) ,Resource Governor for IO

## Title: Understanding the Transaction Log For Faster Throughput
 
**Abstract**:
Does your application suffer from performance problems even though you followed best practices on schema design? Have you looked at your transaction log? 
There's no doubt about it, the transaction log is treated like a poor cousin. The poor thing does not receive much love. The transaction log, however, is a very essential and misunderstood part of your database. There will be a team of developers creating an absolutely awesome elegant design the likes of which have never been seen before, but the leave the transaction log using default settings. It's as if it doesn't matter, an afterthought, a relic of the platform architecture.
In this session, you will learn to appreciate how the transaction log works and how you can improve the performance of your applications by making the right architectural choices. From understanding the internals we can design for faster recovery and batch processes and ironically a smaller transaction log!

## Title: Connecting SQL and Blockchain: The Azure Blockchain Workbench [EN]
 
**Abstract**:
Hype as it is, a valid business case currently is the most critical point for a Blockchain project. So better check it out with a PoC and best with a fast PoC before you start burning money. But getting even a simple PoC for a Blockchain project running still is hard. Connecting Blockchain data to classical databases, making them available to analytics or standard applications is worse (ever queried LevelDB?). Microsofts new "Azure Blockchain Workbench" let you do this in hours, not months. So (besides wondering why one needs this hype stuff at all) we will see how to

- Deploy a Blockchain on Azure in a breeze
- Start coding with Solidity
- Generate templates for smart contracts
- Connect them to IoT devices
- Get a PoC Web UI for free
- Push all the data into a "real" database automatically

Last but not least, we can look at some real world projects.

## Title: Training a large-scale recommendation engine on SQL server 2019
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, we will show how to train a recommendation engine on SQL Server 2019 Big Data clusters (BDC) on Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) using Python, Spark, and SQL. SQL Server 2019 is the first version that tightly integrates HDFS and Apache Spark with a SQL Server engine.
We will start with an overview of the SQL Server 2019 architecture for Big Data clusters. After a brief introduction to Recommender Systems, we will load product ratings to HDFS and link them to the customer and product data in SQL using Polybase. Then we will explore the dataset using Spark, Python and Data Studio and ultimately create a Training and Validation split. In the next step, we will train the Recommendation engine in Spark and persist the model to HDFS. Every step will be performed within the same SQL Server 2019 BDC cluster showcasing the incredible capabilities of SQL 2019.
On-top, by building on SQL Server 2019 BDC and Kubernetes you can run your cluster locally, on premises, or in the cloud.

## Title: 2 Fast 2 Furious - designing for speed, concurrency, and correctness
 
**Abstract**:
With the multitude of isolation levels, concurrency models, and specialist technologies available in SQL Server, it is no surprise that transaction throughput and correctness can be directly correlated to the ability and knowledge of the person that wrote the code.

In this session, we will reveal how SQL Server concurrency and correctness often goes wrong, how we can avoid this, and how we can use our knowledge to design and develop for optimal server throughput for our applications and processes using tips and tricks gained from real-world scenarios.

We will cover SQL Server’s traditional locking model, In-Memory OLTP, Columnstore, Delayed Durability, and many other technologies and techniques you can use to make your transactions more robust.

## Title: An introduction to Data Mining  with SQL Server 2017
 
**Abstract**:
With the vast amount of changes that occur in our daily business environments, it becomes more and more difficult to achieve our corporate goals without some ‘lighthouse’ to guide our way. Data mining, (while not a panacea to resolve or ‘control’ the effects of these changes), can provide us with statistical trends by analyzing our data and highlighting probable outcomes.

In this hands on BEGINNERS presentation we shall be looking at Microsoft SQL Server’s Data Mining capabilities and we shall be discussing:

1)  Defining what questions we want answered and how to go about this in an effective and efficient manner.

2)  Creating the data model.

3)  How to gather the necessary data, discussing the training and testing aspect.

4)  Processing the model.

5)  Extracting information from our finished model, discussing the implications of this information.

## Title: Complex Azure Orchestration with Dynamic Data Factory Pipelines
 
**Abstract**:
If you have already mastered the basics of Azure Data Factory (ADF) and are now looking to advance your knowledge of the tool this is the session for you. Yes, Data Factory can handle the orchestration of our ETL pipelines. But what about our wider Azure environment? In this session we’ll go beyond the basics looking at how we build custom activities, metadata driven dynamic design patterns for Data Factory. Plus, considerations for optimising compute costs by controlling other service scaling as part of normal data processing. Once we can hit a REST API with an ADF web activity anything is possible, extending our Data Factory and orchestrating everything.

## Title: Modern Data Warehousing - The Lambda Approach to Azure BI
 
**Abstract**:
Technology changes quickly - patterns and approaches less so. As we move towards distributed cloud architectures we will employ a range of disparate tools, the patterns that were designed for single box solutions may not be appropriate any more.
 
We will first review the patterns and processes that underpin the Lambda architecture, providing advice and guidance on the tool sets and integration points between them.

This intense, demo-packed session implements real-time reporting using the Lambda Architecture in Azure, demonstrating Azure Data Lake Store, Azure Databricks, Data Factory, SQL Datawarehouse and Stream Analytics. Time permitting, we will compare and contrast against an alternative pattern using Cosmos DB  Spark Structured Streaming.

## Title: Keeping your SQL Code safe – An introduction to GIT and SSDT for DB professionals
 
**Abstract**:
Imagine that you have been hard working in that amazing project, your SQL code has been tuned and contains new features and followed the standard that will be crucial for the success of this project. The deploy date has arrived and you have deployed early in the morning but some minutes after the deploy, the users started to call for reporting several issues in the different systems which are using the Databases that were part of your deployment, after stressful minutes, you realized some SQL code deployed were not the same that were tested and you must rollback your code. 

In this session, I'm going to show you how to avoid problems derived of mistakes during the development process through the proper use of source control code strategy which can combine the potential of GIT and SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) for managing latest version, detecting changes, code review and deploying through environment without stress.

## Title: Launching A Data Science Project:  Cleaning Is Half The Battle
 
**Abstract**:
There's an old adage in software development: Garbage In, Garbage Out. This adage certainly applies to data science projects: if you simply throw raw data at models, you will end up with garbage results. In this session, we will build an understanding of just what it takes to implement a data science project whose results are not garbage. We will use the Microsoft Team Data Science Process as our model for project implementation, learning what each step of the process entails. To motivate this walkthrough, we will see what we can learn from a survey of data professionals' salaries.

## Title: Eight hours of work in 20 minutes
 
**Abstract**:
A case study of how a monthly data load has evolved, from just loading data into a table, through some indexes being disabled before loading and enabled after data is loaded, to partitioning the table and loading into a staging table. The last Changes to the solution has taken loading time from eight hours down to 20 minutes, saving a whole day of work for the staff checking and refining the data.
The presentation also includes some reflections on how partitioning the table has changed how both T-SQL and Entity Framework code is being written, to take advantage of partition elimination.

## Title: ADF Data Flows: Build scalable, cloud-based ETL without code
 
**Abstract**:
- SSIS gave you a graphical user interface for building your Extract, Transform and Load processes hosted in SQL Server
- Azure Data Factory v1 gave you a UI for more scalable Extracting and Loading of data, but the Transformation plug-in was left up to you
- Azure Data Factory v2 gave you more control over how your processes were triggered and the path through your steps (like the Control Flow in SSIS)
- Now coming to ADF is Mapping Data Flows, a UI for building in Transformations into your ETLs, still taking full advantage of scalability in the cloud
