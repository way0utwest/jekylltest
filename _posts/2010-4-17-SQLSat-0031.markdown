##Title: Oh Cluster, My Cluster!##
 
**Abstract**:
Clustering is a black box to many DBAs. Often, the IT dept configures  installs the SQL cluster then turns it over to DBAs to deploy databases and set up backup  maintenance plans. The problem is when things go wrong the DBAs are reliant on the IT dept when their time is better spent working on other things. The goal of this session is to discuss underlying aspects of SQL Server clustering. We will touch on OS and SQL Server issues as well as how it reacts differently being clustered vs non-clustered. We will also discuss the pitfalls of upgrading clustered databases and installing clusters from scratch including lessons learned from a real-world upgrade of a SQL Server cluster where the active and passive nodes are 1,200 miles apart!

##Title: One Developers Journey into MDX##
 
**Abstract**:
"You are a database guy, how do I write a query in MDX?" This is a question that many of you are probably hearing right now as your companies' database experts. As the amount of data access being delivered cubes in increasing every day your company is looking to you to help unlock that stored potential. You have used the query designers and profiler to build some really simple stuff, but now you need to really understand the language and figure how to do some more complex stuff. This session will help you take that journey from not understanding MDX to being an MDX Developer. This session will give you the core concepts of MDX and how to utilize them with clear concrete examples, along with the tools to get you there.

##Title: Perfmon  Profiler 101##
 
**Abstract**:
These two tools are the key to successful performance tuning.  I’ll show you how to get started with these tools, how to slice and dice the results, and even how to data mine the results to look for interesting trends.  Whether you like to monitor performance with native tools or third party utilities, knowing how the native tools work will help you get better results out of your tools.  You'll learn why Perfmon is like a Nissan GT-R’s dashboard, what Perfmon counters to measure (and why), and how to use ClearTrace to get insight into your trace files.

##Title: Working with Spatial Data in SQL Server 2008##
 
**Abstract**:
Spatial data is being pushed more and more into the forefront of our application universe. With the advent of MapPoint and Google Maps companies are consistantly pushing the boundaries of what traditional databases can do. Now with SQL Server 2008 we have built in spatial data types that will make your life a little easier in the days to come.

##Title: How and When to Use Indexed Views##
 
**Abstract**:
Indexed views are an often misunderstood and underused feature of SQL Server that more DBAs should learn to master. Essentially, an indexed view is a standard view that has been materialized (made physical) by adding a unique clustered index to it. When used appropriately, they can greatly speed query performance. In this session, you will learn the features and benefits of using indexed views, learn where indexed views work best, learn how to create indexed views, and review indexed view best practices.

##Title: BLITZ! 60 Minute Server Takeovers##
 
**Abstract**:
You're minding your own business in your corner office - well, no, you're a DBA, so it's just your cubicle - when somebody says, "Did you know about this SQL Server over here?"  Suddenly, you have to find out what the server's doing, how it was set up, and whether things are working correctly.  In this real-time session, Brent will show you how he tackles unknown servers in 60 minutes to find problems, take an inventory, and set the server up for easier management down the road.

##Title: Using XML to Query Execution Plans##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server stores its execution plans as XML in dynamic management views.  The execution plans are a gold mine of information.  From the whether or not the execution plan will rely on parallelism to what columns are requiring a key lookup after a non-clustered index seek.  Through a the use of XML this information can be available at your finger tips to help determine the value and impact of an index and guide you in improving the performance of your SQL Server databases.

Goals:
1.	Discuss information available in an execution plan
2.	Demonstrate use of XQuery to query execution cache
3.	Demonstrate methods to performance tune

##Title: Extended Events, Work Smarter Not Harder##
 
**Abstract**:
There are many ways to performance monitor your SQL Server environment.  In this session we’ll review Extended Events, which is one of the newer SQL Server monitoring platforms.  Learn the ins and outs of how to get detailed information on the errors and events that occur within SQL Server and how to dig into the information.  With a few T-SQL statements, issues that could take weeks to research can be investigated in minutes.  

Goals:
1.	Define the architecture for Extended Events
2.	Identify scenarios where Extended Event can be used to troubleshoot performance
3.	Demonstrate solutions to real-world performance scenarios

##Title: Wait-Time Based Performance Management##
 
**Abstract**:
Using Wait Time Analysis and Wait Types is a newer method for tuning SQL Server instances. As a result, there is often confusion on exactly what the data means. The issue typically centers around the fact the wait time data is analyzed at the wrong level or the collected wait time data is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using SQL Server Wait Type data coupled with Wait-Time based performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues.

##Title: A Dynamic World Demands Dynamic SQL##
 
**Abstract**:
Dynamic SQL is a misunderstood and much maligned part of a DBA’s tool kit – it can be used to solve difficult business problems, respond to diverse data needs, and alleviate performance problems. Many DBAs reject dynamic SQL outright as a potential source of SQL injections, being poorly performing, or just for being a hacky solution in general. Not so! Jeremiah Peschka has been making extensive use of dynamic SQL throughout his career to solve a variety of problems. He’ll set about dispelling these misconceptions and demonstrate how dynamic SQL can become a part of every DBA’s tool kit.
