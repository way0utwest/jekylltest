## Title: Introducing Forensic Analytics with Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
Despite the wealth of analytical technologies available today, 65% of fraud at public companies is detected through tips, management review, or simple accidents.  Forensic Analytics combine human intuition and leading-edge technologies, and can provide superior detection methods to significantly improve the detection and investigation of illegal or unethical activities.
In this session, we explore Forensic Analytics: a set of techniques we can use to uncover irregularities in financial data. We also gain an understanding of goals of Forensic Analytics: to enable us to find out how — and why — these irregularities exist, and to find out their source(s) — especially when fraudulent activity is suspected.  We discuss guiding principles that are key to isolating data anomalies, and outline a standard, repeatable process to Forensic Analytics. Throughout the session, we view examples of how we can employ Power BI to drive Forensic Analytics via various tests and reviews.

## Title: Getting Started with Extended Events
 
**Abstract**:
Few subjects in Microsoft SQL Server inspire the same amount of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) as Extended Events.  Many DBA's continue to use Profiler and SQL Trace even though they have been deprecated for years.  Why is this?

Extended Events started out in SQL Server 2008 with no user interface and only a few voices in the community documenting the features as they found them.  Since then it has blossomed into a full feature of SQL Server and an amazingly low-impact replacement for Profiler and Trace.

Come learn how to get started - the basics of sessions, events, actions, targets, packages, and more.  We will look at some base scenarios where Extended Events can be very useful as well as considering a few gotchas along the way.  You may never go back to Profiler again!

## Title: Pragmatic Power BI:  Transforming Data
 
**Abstract**:
Once we’ve extracted data from a source, we typically need to clean, or otherwise change, that data in preparation for loading it into Power BI.  In this session, BI Architect, SQL Server MVP and Analysis Services Maestro Bill Pearson will explore the options Power BI offers to unpivot, filter, sort, aggregate, and perform other needed operations to make these preparations.  We’ll employ a dataset containing issues that commonly present real-world challenges, and work through the steps we can take in Power BI to transform the data to a state that works within Power BI.  Moreover, we’ll define calculations, and get a glimpse of the M language that underlies transformational processes we construct.

## Title: Get Your Optimizer to Give up All Its Secrets
 
**Abstract**:
You know that execution plans can provide you with vital information to tune a query, but just how does that plan get generated?  In this session, we will examine details the query optimization process that are not very well known.  We will discuss how SQL Server parses a T-SQL statement then and begins applying rules to make it more efficient.  Did you know that SQL Server can be coaxed into outputting hidden structures such as parse trees and memos?  We#39;ll do just that, and then take it a step further with a unique visualization tool that I have created.  With a better understanding of how SQL Server optimizes T-SQL (and sometimes doesn#39;t do it as well as might be hoped), you can write more efficient SQL statements.

## Title: Querying JSON in Azure Data Lake with USQL
 
**Abstract**:
A low cost place to park your JSON data is in Microsoft's Azure Data Lake, a cloud repository for a variety of data.   But how do you query this data?  You can use Hadoop stack tools like Hive. Or why not put your SQL skills to use and write USQL?  USQL is an ANSI SQL like language for querying data in the Azure Data Lake.  After I give a quick demonstration as to how you can read a CSV file,  I will demonstrate how to use a custom Extractor to read JSON files.  We will look at the C# code already built to read these files.  I will demonstrate how to deploy this code.  And finally we will look at how to actually extract the data.  Data is expanding at a dizzying speed.  It is helpful to have up to date tools to handle new kinds of data.

## Title: Top 10 Wait Types Everyone Should Know
 
**Abstract**:
There are over 800 wait types in SQL Server 2014, but there are only 10 (in my experience) that are seen very often. If you can learn these 10 wait types, what causes them and their solutions, you will be ahead of the performance analysis game. The list of 10 wait types to be discussed came from over 100 consulting engagements with customers, so come find out what they are and improve your performance troubleshooting skills.

## Title: What is Biml and why are SSIS developers excited about it?
 
**Abstract**:
This session is designed for you, the experienced SSIS developer who's been hearing about the Business Intelligence Markup Language, Biml, but has not taken the plunge. We will cover what the Biml language is and how using your familiar development tools, SQL Server Data Tools, SSDT, and BIDS Helper, you will be able to streamline the creation of SSIS packages.

We will work through progressively more complex examples from a "Hello World" equivalent to a to a full fledged, audited, truncate and reload pattern based on an external metadata repository. 

You will leave this session armed with the knowledge of how Biml can help you achieve a consistent and reproducible approach for the creation of SSIS solutions.

## Title: SSIS:  Handling flat file changes using BIMLScript
 
**Abstract**:
You develop an SSIS package to load a flat file.  You meticulously identify each of the columns and map the columns to the target table.  Your package runs fine for months.  Then the file format changes.  It is back to the drawing board, selecting each column, setting the data types (type, length, etc.).  In many cases, you actually have the file structure in an electronic form.  Wouldn't it be nice to simply regenerate your SSIS package using that metadata?

In this session I will demonstrate how to automate the generation of SSIS packages using the open source BIML and BIMLScript.  I will generate a set of packages to load all of the tables from one database into a new database using the results of an Information Schema view.

I will then demonstrate how to use this technique to handle changes in file structure.  Using a simple Excel workbook I will represent the structure of a flat file and its relationship to a staging table.  From this metadata, I will generate an SSIS package tha

## Title: Dammit Jim! Dr McCoy’s Field Guide to system_health (and the default trace)
 
**Abstract**:
As DBAs, we are asked all sorts of impossible questions.  Who dropped that important table last month?  Why was everything slow last week?  Who made that user a sysadmin?  You’d have to be a mind reader to know the answers to some of those, right?  Not necessarily!  SQL Server can help you find information about these and other common problems with its default trace and system_health Extended Events session, but you have to know how to collect and interpret the data they provide.  In this session, we’ll explore what system_health and the default trace are, what information they contain, and how to use them to find the answers you’re searching for.

## Title: Ping! No Reply
 
**Abstract**:
Oh! ASYNC_NETWORK_IO just went through the roof! What just happened?
Ever wonder how common tasks such as how servers communicate, how cross-subnet Availability Group failover to your disaster recovery site work, or why ‘they’ always recommend a dedicated network adapter for your WSFC? De-mystifying the networking underneath your databases makes you a stronger database professional. This deep dive technical session will cover many of the critical aspects of enterprise-level networking and how your database servers communicate with the rest of the world. Topics and demonstrations include networking technologies, quality of service, VLANs, routing, monitoring, and trending.
By the end of this interactive session, you will be able to check your own networks for their performance and know how to converse with the networking admins to help improve the overall performance.

## Title: Know What Your Code is Doing to SQL Server!
 
**Abstract**:
ORMs - oh how I LOVE them! As a consultant when I see them in play at a client I go KACHIIINNNNGGGG!! :-D Seriously though, they can provide some substantial benefits for coding throughput. But if you don't Read The Fine Manual and do some things right and avoid some major gotchas you will fall prey to one of my favorite Guruisms: "Anything that allows developers to slap code together more quickly is inversely proportional to the performance and scalability you will get from that code"! Although this talk is based on Entity Framework, most ORMs suffer from a lot of the same flaws.

## Title: Protecting Your Data with Encryption
 
**Abstract**:
We’ve all seen the recent news stories about companies whose data has been stolen by hackers.  What was once a rare event has become all too common, and companies large and small are at risk.  While it isn’t always possible to prevent intrusions, you can reduce the risk by encrypting your data.  In this presentation, I’ll show you the four ways that SQL Server provides to encrypt data: hashes, cell-level encryption, database-level encryption (also known as transparent data encryption), and backup encryption.  We’ll also discuss the keys required for each type of encryption and discuss how to protect the keys themselves.

## Title: Tips and Tricks for Performance Troubleshooting
 
**Abstract**:
“The application is too slow”...”reports are taking too long to load”… “my queries are running slow”. These are complaints we have all heard from our end users, and as we know, it is always the database that is the issue. In this session we will talk about different things to look for when assessing performance of queries. We will examine execution plans at a high level to see where problems may lie and look at some few different “gotchas” that can affect query performance. We will talk about indexes and statistics – what are they, what to index, and how they can help query performance.

## Title: Why Should I Care About ... Partitioned Views?
 
**Abstract**:
Partitioned tables are awesome and partitioned views are dead, right? Well, sure partitioned views are not sexy but there are still plenty of applications where they are critical. And not necessarily just for standard edition. If your data is time stamped, do you see different queries run against older data than new data? Do you with you could segment your data across multiple columns? Do you have data you need to partition horizontally? It's possible partitioned views may still be for you. Come hear why this is still an important topic long after cargo pants and trucker hats went away.

## Title: Weird stuff I saw ... while supporting a Java team
 
**Abstract**:
After spending more than a decade completely devoted to the Microsoft stack, I did some time supporting a Java team. Yes, sure, Java is just another language so there aren't really and issues that are absolutely unique to the Java world. But it is a different stack, different culture, and different group of folks giving bad advice to developers ... just enough different to keep life interesting. Come hear about my misadventures with server side cursors, output parameters, integrated authentication, and NOCOUNT settings.
