## Title: An Unexpected Journey: SQL Server 2000 to 2014
 
**Abstract**:
As a DBA yourself, I’m sure you’ve encountered instances where the SQL Server has been running fine, there’ve been no changes for ages, everything is stable, there’s no exposure to the outside world, and the last time anyone updated or applied a patch to the server was in February 2004… …and then the world intruded, and all of a sudden you’ve been given a directive to “bring that system up to date!” Now what? You’re faced with upgrading not only the SQL Server, but the Windows server as well (and a bunch of other applications), because Microsoft has announced that ALL support for Windows Server 2003 will be going away (far away!) this summer! And some clever person upstairs decided that it would be A GOOD THING to have this SQL Server exposed to the outside…and has commissioned the web dev team to build a whole suite of apps that WILL MAKE THE COMPANY MILLIONS! Where to start…

## Title: Dimensional Modeling Design Patterns: Beyond Basics
 
**Abstract**:
Dimensional modeling is arguably one of the most important
fundamentals of business intelligence.  It is still relevant even as
new technologies like PowerPivot and SSAS Tabular Models are becoming
more popular.  Correctly modeling your organization's data not only
protects the most important asset your company has but ensures that
your data mart or data warehouse will be responsive and capable of
accommodating emerging requirements.

This session provides a deeper dive into 
the art of dimensional modeling. We will look at the different types of fact tables and dimension tables, how and when to use them. We will also some approaches to creating rich hierarchies that make reporting a snap. Finally we will cover  physical design choices.This case study and demo based session promises to be very interactive and engaging, bring your toughest Dimensional Modeling quandaries.

## Title: Abstraction Techniques for SQL Server Reporting Services
 
**Abstract**:
As enterprise Reporting Services solutions mature, maintenance and change requests of existing reports often result in environment inconsistencies and bottleneck new development.  Establishing proper abstraction between data and presentation layers can greatly reduce maintenance tasks and ensure development consistency.

In this session we’ll review the following abstraction techniques and how they can ease maintenance burden and promote consistency across your reporting infrastructure. 
•	Keep SQL within the Database not SSRS
•	One size fits all for parameter aliases 
•	Combine available and default data sets into one procedure

## Title: Getting started with Dimensional Modeling
 
**Abstract**:
Technology has revolutionized the way organizations run today. Rather than a few file cabinets, organizations use many different software packages and applications that are mission critical to running their business. These systems gather a large amount of valuable data that must be used in decision making to maintain a competitive advantage. However, we've all heard and likely been around when mission critical systems have been rendered useless due to long running reports. To solve this and a host of other source system reporting issues we have proven Data Warehousing techniques to store the data in a report friendly way. Dimensional modeling is one of the most widely used set of techniques that will provide source system relief for reporting. In this session, we will take a look at what Dimensional Modeling is along with some key terms and techniques.

## Title: Profiler is Dead! Long Live Extended Events!
 
**Abstract**:
Did you know that Profiler and SQL Trace are deprecated? I know it still works (even in SQL Server 2016 CTP2), but it will never be updated with the latest features. In fact it will never be updated at all! That means if you want to capture information about any new feature, from version SQL Server 2012 and beyond, you need to use another tool. 
That new tool is Extended Events (XE). Not only has it replaced Profiler, and can be used to capture information on all new features, but it is a substantially better tool! 
In this session we will discuss the architecture of Extended Events, how to setup a new trace from scratch or convert an existing Profiler trace, and the new abilities that never existed in Profiler. We will also cover the difference in overhead cost of Profiler and Extended Events.  
Profiler was a friend of mine, but it is time to embrace the new king!

## Title: Tips for SQL Server Performance and Resiliency
 
**Abstract**:
After working 20 years in the industry on hundreds of SQL Servers clear patterns emerge. These observations of patterns and best practices directly relate to the health of the server.#160; During this session we will review the patterns of healthy SQL Servers and identify unhealthy behavior that clearly shows servers that are at risk.#160;
We will review shared patterns, configuration and practices.#160;#160; Which of these repeating patterns represent healthy Servers and which of these patterns are#160; shared with servers that are having issues daily.#160;
These patterns are so clear in fact that I many SQL Servers will benefit from the application of at least one if not more of the tips we will cover.#160; At the end of this session attendees will have the tools to identify and correct common issues that impact SQL Servers Performance and Resiliency.

## Title: SQL Server Security Basics
 
**Abstract**:
The past few years seem to have had more than their fair share of high-profile data breaches, not all of which were caused by sophisticated hacking attempts. This session explains basic methods for securing your SQL Server by making sure you're not leaving the proverbial front door unlocked (or in some cases, wide open). We will discuss the different levels and methods that can be used for granting and restricting rights, and the pros and cons of each. You'll learn steps you can take to design databases with securability in mind from the beginning so you can better protect your data later on down the road. We'll also demonstrate scripts that can help audit user rights and make sure logins don't have any more permissions than they need. Security doesn't have to be scary! Attend this session and gain a solid foundation to build your DBA career on.

## Title: The Augean Stables:  Data Cleansing in the Modern Enterprise
 
**Abstract**:
Every database professional knows the database design ideal and we have all seen that ideal on numerous occasions -  databases in perfect third normal form;  constraints and relational integrity rigorously enforced; elegant error handling in every SQL statement;  data so clean you can eat off it.

Unfortunately we’ve only seen this ideal in textbooks and sample databases designed by vendors.  

The databases we see in the real world are… less than ideal shall we say.  Of course, we use other phrases for what we see but human resources frowns on such terms and this is, after all, a family friendly presentation.  
Database professionals in Greece circa 600 BCE may have access to the Alpheus and Peneus rivers to cleanse their particular stables but we modern folks need to rely on the tools on our own computers such as SQL and SSIS.  Mike will review various techniques and tools for data cleansing that will help you wash away the muck to get to the data gold standard.

## Title: Achieving Peak Performance from your Virtual SQL Servers
 
**Abstract**:
Your SQL Servers are probably virtualized by now, but are they running at their absolute peak performance? How can you tell? When properly configured and maintained, a virtualized SQL Server will be at least as fast as the system that it came from, if not better. If not properly configured, silent performance killers can wreck your virtualization experience. This session will give you tips and tricks to maximize performance while giving you talking points so you can convince your infrastructure engineers to design the virtualization stack your way. This session goes deep into the architecture and methodology for squeezing the best possible performance from your virtualized SQL Server, and includes valuable tips on topics such as host-level over-commitment, storage performance, In-memory OLTP, and more!

## Title: Analyzing I/O Subsystem Performance
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is often I/O bound - but why? Do you feel lost when talking to your storage administrator?  Are your storage subsystems like a mysterious black box where your databases live but you can’t go visit? This session will get you up to speed with the fundamentals of storage subsystems for SQL Server. You will learn about the different types of storage that are available, and how to decide what type of storage to use for different workload types. You will also learn useful tips and techniques for configuring your storage for the best performance and reliability. We’ll cover methods to effectively measure and monitor your storage performance so that you will have valuable information and evidence available the next time you have to discuss IO performance with your storage administrator. Come to this session to learn how to analyze I/Os as well as options to reduce the bottlenecks.

## Title: Stress Inoculation: Maintaining Performance Under Pressure
 
**Abstract**:
Stress is a natural reaction to demanding events for which our natural resources to cope or react are low. Initial effects might be increased energy and focus but can quickly give way to inaction and costly mistakes. 

This course presents a variety of simple yet highly actionable techniques borrowed from some of the most stressful fields on earth. In this course, you learn to apply the same methods that doctors, military, law enforcement, and paramedics learn to cope and perform under high-stress situations. Discover how easily these techniques translate to almost any career or endeavor.  

Whether you regularly support a multi-million dollar data center on a 24-hour on-call rotation or are asked to restore production while three levels of management look over your shoulder, counting the dollars lost per minute, everyone is susceptible to stress. Some people just have a higher immunity. Attend this inoculation session and get caught up on your boosters.

## Title: 2014 SSIS Project Deployment Model: Deployment and Maintenance
 
**Abstract**:
The 2014 SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) Project Deployment Model introduces new opportunities for the delivery of SSIS solutions. Gone are decisions about logging providers, configuration approaches, and deployment targets. Now, you need to focus on the creation of an .ispac, the approaches to deploying the project, and applying configurations to ensure expected behavior.

This session begins by exploring mapping between elements in an SSIS project and their counterparts in the compiled file, the .ispac. The session then covers three approaches for automating the deployment of this unit into SSISDB We then cover the administration side of the SSIS Catalog. You create SSIS environment variables and apply them to configure run-time behaviour. Finally, you work through the native tooling to troubleshoot failed SSIS packages. We'll cover SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) reports, Catalog views, and data taps for run-time collection of values.

## Title: Accelerating DevOps Using Data Virtualization
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps is the melding of application development, testing, and IT operations. All tasks from infrastructure to coding to testing to transition into production must be automated so that new features and fixes can be continuously delivered.

Constraining DevOps is data. Databases and applications have grown enormous and complex. "Storage is cheap" is a lie. Provisioning a full environment for each developer or tester on each task of each project appears unrealistic, when each might require several terabytes of storage. And so everyone is limited to working in a small handful of shared environments that are refreshed only every few months, and code quality suffers.

Data virtualization is the solution. Virtual databases and file-systems only consume space from deltas, so it is possible to provision multiple terabytes for megabytes. Coders and testers have full environments fast in which to develop and test, improving code quality.  Learn about the technical details behind this solution.

## Title: Why should I care about the plan cache?
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this first (and hopefully not last) installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series a case for why working knowledge of how to query the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments, followed by a review of relevant DMV's for the newly motivated audience. Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBA is sometimes so moody.

## Title: Source Control practices for your BI World
 
**Abstract**:
Source Control is a critical part of any development effort. For small shop developers tools like TFS can be overwhelming especially for developers that come from organizations with little to no source control experience.  Let's talk about practices and ways to implement source control for SSIS, SSRS and Database Projects in both multi-developer and multi-tiered environments.  We will cover when and how to branch, merge and shelve and discuss ideas around process for deployment and continuous integration.

## Title: Getting Started with Execution Plans
 
**Abstract**:
There are times when you are able to be proactive and tune existing queries. Sometimes, you will receive a phone call from your manager telling you that a certain web page or report is timing out and your users are furious. You need to quickly diagnose what the problem is. Where do you turn to first? When a query is underperforming, hogging resources or timing out, one of the first things you want to examine is the query execution plan. An execution plan provides a wealth of information that can help you quickly diagnose what is wrong. In this beginner level session you will learn what an execution plan is, how to find it, and how to interpret it to see what the query optimizer is doing and find the major pain points.

## Title: SQL Server Benchmarking: The Powershell Speedometer
 
**Abstract**:
How fast do you think you were going? The only way to be sure is to have a reliable way to measure your performance. The challenge with SQL Server is that there are many aspects of your stack that you need to measure and understand. Powershell, with its ability to access and report on all these different levels, can give you a robust tool to benchmark your SQL Server. This session will cover benchmarking methodologies, the tools Powershell offers for capturing performance information, and will demonstrate how you can use them to measure performance statistics. After attending this session, you will understand how to effectively use Powershell to measure your database speed.

## Title: The Life Cycle of a Query in VR
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever wondered what really happens behind the scenes when you execute a query? In this unique demonstration, Todd will use a video game engine (Unreal Engine 4) and will dramatically show The Life Cycle of a Query in VR. We will follow a query from beginning to end and "runthrough" the various SQL Server components all queries must use including the Protocol Layer, Relational Engine, Storage Engine, Buffer Pool and then back out to the client. A volunteer at the end will then don an Oculus Rift DK2 Virtual Reality headset and then race through the sections in under a minute to win a prize. Participants will leave with a better understanding of the major components and with a conceptual framework to explore the components more in-depth.

## Title: Row-Based Security in SSRS and SSAS
 
**Abstract**:
It is relatively straight-forward to grant a user access to a particular SSRS report, multi-dimensional cube, or tabular model table, but what happens when the user needs access to the object but should be denied access to view certain rows of data?  In this session we'll investigate a real-world solution to this common BI problem.

## Title: Don't Rely on Magic - Tabular Performance Troubleshooting 
 
**Abstract**:
Many times you'll hear that one of the major advantages of using the tabular model is ease of use and implementation.  So that must mean that it will run like a super fast dream all the time out of the box, forever and ever right?  Not exactly.  There are many things to consider at the time of modeling and implementation for performance.  And later if you run into trouble with reports and queries, what do you do then?  In this session we'll go through the process to troubleshoot performance of your tabular models and queries to keep things running as fast as possible.  Just because tabular is easy to use doesn't mean you have a magical black box that you can't tune when it doesn't run as fast as you want.  In this session, we will focus on building a methodology for troubleshooting tabular performance so you can get that super fast dream machine.

## Title: Use Hive and Hadoop for High Performance Data Warehousing
 
**Abstract**:
Big Data has moved beyond the hype and entered the mainstream as a tool for managing large and unstructured data sets, giving data architects more options for managing data. The Hadoop ecosystem has become the tool of choice and Microsoft has entered this arena with HDInsight in the cloud. For DBAs this means having a place to store data that can be accessed using a highly parallel framework. In this session you’ll see how to use the numerous tools available to store data in Hadoop, process it, manage it, and retrieve it. We’ll explore Sqoop and how its many options can be configured to import data by taking advantage of Hadoop’s massive parallelism. We will develop and run Map\Reduce code, with an emphasis on understanding what belongs in a mapper function versus what belongs in a reducer function, while demonstrating Hadoop Streaming with languages such as R and C#.  Finally, Hive will be shown to exhibit the use of a high-level query language in Hadoop for those who prefer SQL.

## Title: Hadoop, and Hive, and Json and Data! Oh my! 
 
**Abstract**:
Tips and Tricks and Painful lessons learned as I have ventured into the world of Hadoop, JSon and Hive. Our data has made the move from a relational database to a JSon structure, and reporting across the entire enterprise of data has changed. We have introduced Hadoop batch processing to our ETL processes to collect and process data from various locations, depositing them in various other locations. Along the way, various brick walls were surmounted. We will discuss some of these brick walls. Some of the oddities encountered in this journey. and hopefully prepare you for a similar trip, without all the pain we suffered.
