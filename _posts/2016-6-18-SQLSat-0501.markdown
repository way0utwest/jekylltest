## Title: Super Scaling Clustered Index Inserts
 
**Abstract**:
Want to know how to go from 13,000 to 550,000 inserts per second on the same hardware ?, this session will show you how from key construction, reducing the overhead of SQL language processing, database engine tuning, delayed durability etc. During this journey core database concepts will be explained at a level not touched at in the SQL Server internals book and windows performance toolkit will be used to provide some deep insights into what the database engine is doing. This is a level 400 session which will cover so core database engine concepts and material that cannot be found anywhere else, for example it will explain why running a singleton on a particular NUMA node is faster than running the same insert on any other NUMA node.

## Title: Revolutionary R integration in SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
The R integration brings a lot of benefits and new scenarios to on premises data platform systems:
•	R can greatly simplify collection of different data.
•	Data manipulation and preparation can also be way easier with R.
•	You can use R to quickly explore and visualize data. 
•	Last but not least, R brings the whole power of modern data mining techniques to SQL Server.   
As if this was not enough, you can use familiar user interface and SQL Server Enterprise R Services to work with large datasets and multi-threaded, multi-core, multi-process computations. So, even if you don’t know R at all, come and see how natural this language is for everybody who already think in rows and columns.

## Title: Unraveling Tangled Code:A Spellbinding Tale of Victory Over Chaos
 
**Abstract**:
Once upon a time, you inherited an application or a database that was filled with chaos and inconsistencies. The T-SQL code is overly complex and impossible to ken. The architecture is painful to behold, and grueling to code for. One might optimistically say that query performance is “spectacularly mediocre”. If you’re without good documentation or system architects to guide you, how do you break the curse of confusion? In this session you’ll learn several methods for conquering chaotic code, and how to seek and destroy some of the nastier coding mistakes and inefficiencies. We will break complicated queries into key pieces, turn them upside-down, and reform them into something sensible. We will vanquish major issues like data abuse and index negligence. We will restructure joins, tame subqueries, and refactor dynamic SQL. We will emerge victorious!

## Title: Data Driven Organisation: Machine Learning as part of an organisation's DNA
 
**Abstract**:
The session explores how organisations are using machine learning techniques to deliver agile analytics as they become a data-driven organisation's DNA.
How it is possible to imprint data-driven analytical thinking into the culture of the organization? Is Machine Learning viable for everyone? Analytics platforms have always been tools built for statisticians and data scientists. However, these tools are increasingly being directed at business analysts, and Gartner's rankings on its well-known "completeness of vision" and "ability to execute" axes now rest as much on "ease of use" as they do on offering advanced analytical algorithms.
Machine learning focuses the emphasis on the insights and value that data brings, and it is now accessible to organisations. 

This session will help you to:

- understand how to craft an ML strategy
- provision the right business analytical capabilities
- move towards actionable results
- identify common pitfalls

## Title: Azure Machine Learning: From Design to Integration
 
**Abstract**:
Machine Learning is a subfield of computer science concerned with systems that learn from data. So this isn’t about systems that follow explicitly programmed instructions, but rather about systems that find patterns and trends within datasets, and use them to deliver insight and predictions.

In this session, you will learn how an Azure Machine Learning solution comes to life: From the creation of a workspace, to the preparation of data, to experimentation with Machine Learning algorithms, and then finally to the integration and embedding of predictive insights into applications.

This session has been specifically designed to describe Machine Learning fundamentals, and to help enable and inspire existing data professionals taking their first steps to leverage cloud-based predictive models delivered with Azure Machine Learning. It is guaranteed to thrill you with potential, and excite you with the relative ease by which it can be accomplished.

## Title: SQL Azure – DTUs and Delta (with on-prem)
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Azure has been around for over five years, and is now ready for enterprise production workloads.  This session will address the two issues that Architects, DBAs and Developers want to know more about as they move production workloads to the Cloud.  

One topic is the mystery around DTUs (Database Transaction Units), the units that are used to indicate the relative performance levels of different tiers of SQL Azure.  The first part of this session will explain the concept of DTUs and how to choose which one as the starting point.

The other topic is the difference in features between SQL Azure and SQL Server.  Because of the fundamental multi-tenant nature of SQL Azure, there will always be differences between the two.  Over the years, these differences are being continuously reduced, and this session will explain the current delta.

## Title: BI Office from Pyramid Analytics Delivering Better Decision for Everyone
 
**Abstract**:
Today’s organisations struggle to get measurable value from their business intelligence tools, preventing business agility, fragmenting data and risking gaps in their data security.

To become a data-driven organization, business leaders need more than overhyped productivity tools and analytic engines to make decisions. They need a thoughtfully designed platform that empowers everyone to make data an integral part of their day-to-day processes and decisions. They need an end-to-end solution that can bring together disparate data in a governed environment that allows users to easily model, discover, communicate, and distribute information.

For years now Business Intelligence products have forced organisations to make a choice between Governance and Scalability on the one hand or Agility and Self-Service on the other.  As a result, many Enterprises possess a patchwork quilt of Reporting, Dashboarding and Analysis tools creating multiple interpretations of the same underlying data.

## Title: Effective Index Partitioning, Compression Strategy
 
**Abstract**:
We all know that ‘Indexing’ is KING when it comes to achieving high levels of performance in SQL Server. 
When Indexing also combines 2 of the Enterprise features: Partitioning  Compression, we can often see substantial gains.

Learn how to identify those objects that benefit greatly from being Partitioned or Compressed, OR combining both of these features to even greater effect.

Using Demos to illustrate the performance gains with real-world examples, Take away advanced scripts for use in your own environments.

## Title: WTF with SQL
 
**Abstract**:
SQL is based on the relational  algebra, right? Relational algebra is based on set theory, right? So we would expect SQL to  kind-of respect common sense from set theory. Like A union A has the same number of elements as A. Well, this is not always the case with SQL.

Come and have fun when we explore scenarios of simple SQL statements, where I guarantee you moments of inner WTF.

## Title: Polybase in SQL Server – Big Data Queried with T-SQL
 
**Abstract**:
BigData solutions cross our sight in more or less intense way during past couple of years. Various implementations of this technology generate another set of technical skills required when you invest in this field and they may become real road blocks in your projects. When companies work on large analytical solutions Microsoft says: “Stick with T-SQL only when you query Big Data”. You’ll see how efficient can SQL Server be when you retrieve information from less structured files and Hadoop. Plus, how can you mix it with relational databases. SQL Server married with Big Data – live in action!
