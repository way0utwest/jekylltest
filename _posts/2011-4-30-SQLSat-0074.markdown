My life before all this was as a high school Drama teacher here in Florida.  It might seem an odd transition, but it really isn't.  To me, part of being a great DBA is embracing the artistry of the process.  How the design of a database ebbs and flows into its final form.  So, I guess you could say I am a SQL artist.

Brandie's first computer experience was with a State-of-the-Art Commodore 64 brought home by her father, who informed her that "computers are NOT toys" and would not let her use it until she learned how to program. In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville. She has published several articles on SQLServerCentral.com, trains her co-workers in SQL Server, and has previously presented at several SQL Saturday events and JSSUG meetings.

##Title: Implementing auditing in SQL Server##
 
**Abstract**:
The ability to audit in SQL server has been available for quite some time using different tools and techniques.  This session will outline several methods to implement audtiting, but will focus primarily on SQL Audit.
SQL Audit provides the ability to track and log activities and changes at the instance or database level built upon Extended Events SQL Audit provides both synchronous and asynchronous capabilities. The granularity of events that can be monitored and tracked with SQL Audit can only be matched by means of using a SQL Profiler trace, but provides reduced overhead. This presentation will provide insight into the internals of SQL Audit, along with how to plan, create, and monitor instance and database level audits.

To me, part of being a great DBA is embracing the artistry of the process.  How the design of a database ebbs and flows into its final form.  So, I guess you could say I am a SQL artist.

##Title: DR Availability,You're Wanted in the Recovery Room##
 
**Abstract**:
There are a lot of options when it comes to disaster recovery and high availability with regards to SQL Server. Most business owners (and many DBA’s) lump disaster recovery (DR)  high availability (HA) together and while they do share some pieces, they call for different strategies. Do you pick one or more than one of these options, and based on what? It’s incredibly important that you understand the decision tree that helps you pick the right one(s) for your business, and that you can explain the choices clearly to the stakeholders. It’s not as complicated as it sounds, but it is complicated – and in this hour presentation we’ll give you a high level understanding of the options, the costs, complexities,  reasons for using each of them.

##Title: SSIS: Lookup Between the Lines##
 
**Abstract**:
This session covers some interesting ways to work with data iand SQL in ETL, and solve some common problems
1. Using Range Predicates in a Lookup Transform (Using Between and IN type lookups can give you VERY sophisticated matching techniques you may not have known were available in SSIS), 
2. Using stored procs and parameters in a lookup
3. Having a named parameter to match on in an OleDB lookup.

In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville.

She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

My life before all this was as a high school Drama teacher here in Florida.  It might seem an odd transition, but it really isn't.  To me, part of being a great DBA is embracing the artistry of the process.  How the design of a database ebbs and flows into its final form.  So, I guess you could say I am a SQL artist.

##Title: You inherited a database, now what?##
 
**Abstract**:
You have recently inherited the support of a new or existing database, what are the things you should immediately check and start monitoring and what are the things that you should address over the next few weeks. When taking over support of a database or system, you cannot ASSUME anything. At the end of this session you will have a nice checklist of things you should check and be doing on ALL your databases not just the one you inherited. Whether you are a seasoned DBA or just starting out, this session should be informative and something you can relate to.

In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville.

##Title: Multisite Clusters for HA and Disaster Recovery##
 
**Abstract**:
Windows Server 2008 R2 failover clustering supports the concept of a "multisite cluster", which provides an excellent disaster recovery and high availability solution for SQL Server. This session will describe the concept of a multisite cluster and why it provides the best recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) for all of your SQL Server databases and other applications. Configuration details, known issues and a live demonstration will complete this session. After this session the attendee should be armed with the knowledge to propose a robust disaster recovery solution for any environment.

In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville.

To me, part of being a great DBA is embracing the artistry of the process.  How the design of a database ebbs and flows into its final form.  So, I guess you could say I am a SQL artist.

##Title: Taking SSIS to the Next Level##
 
**Abstract**:
In this presentation, Kyle will dig a little deeper into SSIS, and explore some intermediate level developing methods, including package configurations, using the expression language within SSIS, and the commonly overlooked tool, Checkpoints, that can save the developer from having to do restart a time consuming package from the beginning. For each topic, we’ll begin with how the feature works, and then move into the steps one would take to set up Configurations, Expressions, and Checkpoints in a package. Finally, you will see a demonstration of each feature in action from start to finish.

In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville.

##Title: The Fundamentals of DBA-ism##
 
**Abstract**:
When I was a freshly minted DBA and trying to learn the ropes, my manager used to tell me “You should know that, that’s DBA 101”.     As much as it frustrated me, he was right.  There is a core set of knowledge that DBA.  Correct  SQL installation and configuration, how’s and whys of backups,  how to make your role proactive, and many other things fall under that heading.  This session is for the “freshly minted” DBA to help them find and define their own set of best practices.

She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

My life before all this was as a high school Drama teacher here in Florida.  It might seem an odd transition, but it really isn't.  To me, part of being a great DBA is embracing the artistry of the process.  How the design of a database ebbs and flows into its final form.  So, I guess you could say I am a SQL artist.

##Title: What is this Cache and why is it so big?##
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wonder what's in your SQL Plan cache? Wonder why or how it got so big? This session will cover what it is, how it's used, how it can affect performance and how poor application and query design can make it worse. Rather than put participants to sleep with a slide deck we will get down and dirty with lots of demos.

She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

My life before all this was as a high school Drama teacher here in Florida.  It might seem an odd transition, but it really isn't.

She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

My life before all this was as a high school Drama teacher here in Florida.  It might seem an odd transition, but it really isn't.  To me, part of being a great DBA is embracing the artistry of the process.  How the design of a database ebbs and flows into its final form.  So, I guess you could say I am a SQL artist.

I have spent the last 16 years of my life living, learning and teaching SQL Server.  I am currently a Principal DBA at SAIC, and I teach online DBA courses at BYU-Idaho.   My life before all this was as a high school Drama teacher here in Florida.  It might seem an odd transition, but it really isn't.  To me, part of being a great DBA is embracing the artistry of the process.  How the design of a database ebbs and flows into its final form.  So, I guess you could say I am a SQL artist.

My life before all this was as a high school Drama teacher here in Florida.  It might seem an odd transition, but it really isn't.

**Brandie Tarvin** 
Database Administrator by day and Author by night Brandie Tarvin sails pirate-populated waters, fights evil robots in disguise and turns kingdoms into chaotic rebellious city-states all while coding ETL processes and protecting real-world data from corruption. If it weren't for her, someone else would have the job and where would be the fun in that?

Brandie's first computer experience was with a State-of-the-Art Commodore 64 brought home by her father, who informed her that "computers are NOT toys" and would not let her use it until she learned how to program. In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville. She has published several articles on SQLServerCentral.com, trains her co-workers in SQL Server, and has previously presented at several SQL Saturday events and JSSUG meetings. She also writes fiction and freelances for Catalyst Game Labs in her spare time.

I have spent the last 16 years of my life living, learning and teaching SQL Server.  I am currently a Principal DBA at SAIC, and I teach online DBA courses at BYU-Idaho.   My life before all this was as a high school Drama teacher here in Florida.  It might seem an odd transition, but it really isn't.  To me, part of being a great DBA is embracing the artistry of the process.  How the design of a database ebbs and flows into its final form.  So, I guess you could say I am a SQL artist.
