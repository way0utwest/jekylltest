## Title: Advanced SSIS Techniques
 
**Abstract**:
As an ETL developer using SQL Server Integration Services have you ever wondered how to:
1.	Import all .csv files from a folder
2.	Replace dynamic SQL using variables in SSIS
3.	How to configure the data flow buffer
4.	Create custom logging solutions
5.	Use a script component as a data flow transformation
This session focuses on advanced techniques that are used in SSIS and is meant for the experienced SSIS developer.  We will focus on tasks and techniques that are native to SSIS 2005-2014 as well as some of the more advanced and vague  properties.  
Attendees must have a good working knowledge of SSIS as well as familiarity with VB.NET or C# as some time will be taken looking at extending SSIS with script tasks and components.
Upon completion of this workshop attendees will be able to:
1.	Import/export multiple sources/destinations
2.	Use an execute SQL task with variables to replace dynamic SQL within a package
3.	Dynamically handle errors within any part of a package
4.

## Title: DevOps for the DBA - Bridging the Gap Between Infrastructure, Administration, and Development
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps is a term that has come to mean many things to many people. At its core, this important concept represents a way to remove old barriers between the infrastructure, application, and development tiers within an IT organization. An understanding of scripting and automation platforms is becoming a critical skill for SQL Server Database Administrators. Additionally, as hardware is increasingly virtualized, new opportunities for scripted deployment and configuration are available. This session will utilize demos to illustrate the many ways SQL Database Administrators can automate routine tasks from deployment through configuration.

## Title: Guerilla MDM via MDS/SSIS Implementation
 
**Abstract**:
 I have implemented at several client. In implementing MDS   I have extensive experience in creating data quality, data governance and MDM/MDS accelerators I published many articles.

Accelerators can take many forms generally there either software products that accelerate development and/or techniques that embody data aware and code generation capabilities.

In developing the MDS application extracting data, applying data quality, loading MDS entities, and extracting data from MDS, we have applied these techniques, that I have published articles on.

Specifically we've created an
SSIS/MDS application architecture is highly reusable and can easily be used to Quickstart other MDS projects requiring minimal change and leaving the best practices for MDS architecture, as I understand them. The basic principle we applied this to be a data aware (data profiling)and create SSIS code that will self generate loan pr

## Title: Automating Your Database Deployments
 
**Abstract**:
Deploying your database changes to production can be nerve-wracking. We'll discuss methods that take the stress out of the process by ensuring that you practice your deployments using continuous integration before you ever get near production. Automating the deployment and testing processes through various pre-production environments can make the whole experience of production deployments more repeatable, more reliable and more robust.

In this session, we'll explore the concepts of continuous integration and continuous delivery for databases – what to consider, the challenges, the benefits, the testing, and the crucial approval gates necessary for a reliable production deployment. We'll discuss these and other release strategies as you think about how to evolve your deployment pipeline towards a more automated approach, starting with continuous integration and ending at your production systems.

## Title: Building Perfect SQL Servers, Every Time
 
**Abstract**:
One of the biggest challenges in any large SQL environment is maintaining consistent configurations and meeting the pressures from the business for rapid server deployments. Additionally by default, SQL Server does not install with the best practices for every environment. You will learn best practices for system settings, file system layout and scheduling maintenance tasks. You will learn about what the best practices are for most SQL Server configurations, and how to automate your SQL Server builds in both a physical and virtual world. You will learn about the tradeoffs and benefits to completely automating the build process. You were hear about lessons learned building a private cloud at a Fortune 100 telecommunications company. You will also learn how use these same methods to ensure consistency with your servers whether they are in the cloud, or on-premises.

## Title: Autogenerating a process data warehouse
 
**Abstract**:
In many data warehouses we model fact tables with measures based on attributes which we can count and do arithmetic upon. It is more difficult to handle fact tables with measures based on length of intervals of events happening in the source systems. So questions like "What are the typical waiting times in our order process?" are seldomly modelled in the data warehouse. Especially if the event data comes from different source systems. 

In this talk I will show you how Rehfeld has overcome this difficult problem using an autogenerated datawarehouse based on metadata on the objects in the EDW/DM layers. In this approach you can autogenerate the process data warehouse if only you have the timestamps present in the EDW layer and are able to correlate them. The talk will consist of slides and demos.

## Title: Lock, Block and Two Smoking Barrels - Inside SQL Server Concurrency
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a high performance relational engine and provides a highly scalable database platform but due to its complexity, bad programming practices, poor indexing and configuration can be prone to serious concurrency problems, unexpected behaviors, lost updates and much more! In SQL Server 2005, two optimistic concurrency mechanisms were introduced and touted as the solution to all our problems. Now in SQL Server 2012 and SQL 2014 even more have followed including latch free data-structures, but many challenges and problems still remain. Let’s take a long look into the world of SQL Server concurrency and investigate Pessimistic and Optimistic isolation understanding how they work, when you should use them, and more importantly when they can go very wrong. Don't be staring down the wrong end of SQL Server's two Smoking Barrels and join me for this revealing and thought provoking presentation.

## Title: Comprehensive Indexing with Automated Execution Plan Analysis
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2005 made much of information necessary for performance available through easily accessible DMVs. Ad-hoc performance tuning is possible simply with direct queries to the DMVs. Many database today actually show signs of having too many indexes. A degree of index consolidation is possible by visual examination. A more ambitious objective is to build a set of good  indexes with no more indexes than necessary. To do this, it is necessary to catalog the index usage of hundreds if not thousands of SQL statements. Impossible or impractical? This can be done by automating execution plan analysis using ExecStats (free on QDPMA.com)

## Title: Learning Entity Framework 6
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft has clearly positioned the Entity Framework 6 (EF) as the primary data access platform for .NET applications. But many developers have yet to embrace the powerful Object Relational Mapping (ORM) capabilities that EF offers. Whether you’re new to ORM, or you’ve dabbled in other ORM technologies, Lenni will show how quickly you can start working with EF6 and boost your productivity when building data-centric .NET applications.

We’ll begin with a quick introduction to ORM and EF, and then explain many of the special ORM features in EF6, such as the Entity Data Model, and table splitting, inheritance, entity splitting, and many-to-many relationships. With the basics covered, Lenni will then dive right into live demos that show what EF can do for you as a data access layer, using database-first, model-first, and code-first approaches with both direct SQL and stored procedures. We’ll also discuss new features introduced in EF6, and show how to use EF in N-Tier scenarios.

## Title: Tips that have saved my bacon
 
**Abstract**:
n this session, I propose to share some of the tricks I've used on the operational side of being a DBA. There's saying, never perform small miracles, people to rely on them, but isn't it useful to have a few in your back-pocket. Everyone knows log-shipping is great for DR recovery, but what about using it for minor issues, like a delete or update gone bad? Want to move a large table someplace else (like that "oh it'll just be a small audit table, it won't grow large because we'll write the functionality later to keep it small" and they never do? UNC backups... an often overlooked but useful option for making a backup AND getting it off your server. Run a small operation where too many fingers have access to the operational DB and you want to catch them? These are some of the tricks I've picked up over the years and used more than once to perform small miracles and have saved my bacon or the bacon of others

## Title: Geospatial Data Types in SQL Server 2012
 
**Abstract**:
The geospatial capabilities in SQL Server are not only powerful, but easy and fun to use! In this session, Lenni shows you how to integrate location-awareness into your own applications with the geometry and geography data types. We’ll explore the planar and geodetic spatial models, spatial markup languages such as WKT and GML, and then put these concepts to use as we build several useful demos, (e.g., Bing Maps integration). Demos show how to use the geospatial methods to easily calculate area, length, and distance, and project new shapes based on intersection and overlap. Attend this session and embrace spatial programming today!

## Title: SSIS Data Flow Engine: Under the Hood
 
**Abstract**:
A data flow task moves data from point A to point B, but how does it work behind the scenes? Understanding the internals of data flow engine can help you make correct package design choices in the first place and identify issues when your data loads run forever.

Using simple analogies, you'll see how data flow engine moves data through each component, uses buffers, builds execution trees, and transforms data in the pipeline. Along the way, you'll learn corresponding options and tips that make your packages run as fast as possible. This demo-filled session is for SSIS developers who're comfortable with creating packages but not so comfortable figuring out why data flow is slow and when or how to parallelize the data flows. Open the hood, you need to know how data flow engine works to make it 
work for you in an efficient and optimal way.

## Title: Version control with GIT for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
In 2005, Linus Torvalds developed a version control system (VCS) called git. Since then, it has become as platform agnostic and ubiquitous as the internet. In that same note, github, the most popular service for hosting git repositories has become so ubiquitous that Microsoft chose to host the source code for its OSS fork of the .NET framework there instead of its own codeplex.

What does this mean to a DBA? Well. whether or not you use SSDT, you should be storing your database schema in version control. In addition, your utility scripts certainly belong in VCS. 

In my session. We will cover:

What is version control?
How does a distributed version control system differ from traditional version control like Visual Sourcesafe, TFS, and SVN?
How do I setup git for internal use in my company?
How do I host public and private repositories on github.
How do pull requests work?
How do I fork a SVN repo to github?

We will be covering using git from both the command line and Vis

## Title: The Best Practices for Columnstore Indexes
 
**Abstract**:
Columnstore indexes were introduced in SQL Server 2012 and completely change the way in which we can store and process data using the new columnar format. With SQL Server 2014 and Azure SQL expanding the use of these indexes, it's important to keep in mind the best practices to get the most benefit out of this technology. In this session we will do a quick intro to columnstores and immediately dive into demos on how to load data, modify the index and write queries. All using the best practices to leverage the maximum benefits from these indexes.

## Title: Architecting Real-Time Data Warehouses with SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Most data warehouses are scheduled to update periodically, such as once nightly.  Others need to be refreshed in real-time, providing business users with up to the minute reports and analytics.  This session will review the architecture required to construct a dimensional data warehouse, source it with real-time ETL using Change Data Capture (CDC), and query it efficiently from various reporting tools.  It will cover advanced topics such as managing concurrent reads/writes using RCSI, storing real-time aggregates using indexed views, avoiding deadlocks using application locking, and other real-world construction/tuning/maintenance issues inherent in a real-time system.

## Title: Inside the Query Optimizer
 
**Abstract**:
When it comes to SQL Server one of the biggest request you hear is “How can I make my Query Run FASTER!?”.  The answer understanding the first step in that process Is understanding the Query Optimizer.  Understanding the Optimizer beings with knowing the Rules.  The way our queries are written reflect directly on the output that we get. In this session we will look at the rules in SQL Server, write queries to show those rules in action, and walk out with a better understanding of how the Optimizer works.

## Title: Accounting Basics for Database Developers
 
**Abstract**:
Many database developers sooner or later need to consume from or feed data to an accounting application such as the 
General Ledger.  Not being trained as bookkeepers, we may find bookkeeping conventions confusing at best and mystical at 
worst.  When is a credit negative, and a debit positive ?  The subject also has a reputation for being dull.  

But not really understanding the concepts and semantics seriously impedes unit testing, effective communication with the business, and  excessive dependence on business analysts as intermediaries.  We can do better !  This session will focus on demystifying the concepts and terms, facilitating further study if you are so inclined, and enabling you to understand the requirements and be proactive in testing.  

The session will conclude with a brief demo showing how SQL Server's Analysis Services directly supports some bookkeeping concepts.

## Title: Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations
 
**Abstract**:
With the introduction of in-memory based tables in SQL Server 2014, it’s natural to expect  significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  In this session, we are going to take a look at the changes to the indexing design for in-memory based objects and how it differs from existing disk based table indexing. Also, we are going to cover how to choose the appropriate indexes for your in-memory object to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.

## Title: Tips for SQL Server Performance and Resiliency
 
**Abstract**:
After working 20 years in the industry on hundreds of SQL Servers clear patterns emerge. These observations of patterns and best practices directly relate to the health of the server.#160; During this session we will review the patterns of healthy SQL Servers and identify unhealthy behavior that clearly shows servers that are at risk.#160;
We will review shared patterns, configuration and practices.#160;#160; Which of these repeating patterns represent healthy Servers and which of these patterns are#160; shared with servers that are having issues daily.#160;
These patterns are so clear in fact that I many SQL Servers will benefit from the application of at least one if not more of the tips we will cover.#160; At the end of this session attendees will have the tools to identify and correct common issues that impact SQL Servers Performance and Resiliency.

## Title: The Life Cycle of a Query in VR
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever wondered what really happens behind the scenes when you execute a query? In this unique demonstration, Todd will use a video game engine (Unreal Engine 4) and will dramatically show The Life Cycle of a Query in VR. We will follow a query from beginning to end and "runthrough" the various SQL Server components all queries must use including the Protocol Layer, Relational Engine, Storage Engine, Buffer Pool and then back out to the client. A volunteer at the end will then don an Oculus Rift DK2 Virtual Reality headset and then race through the sections in under a minute to win a prize. Participants will leave with a better understanding of the major components and with a conceptual framework to explore the components more in-depth.

## Title: Flash  SQL Server— Re-Thinking Best Practices
 
**Abstract**:
Flash storage is a game changer for virtually every app in which it is used.  Whether used locally, for tiered storage, or all-flash arrays, flash is turning what we thought we knew about SQL Server best practices on its head.  Contemporary IT environments should standardize their architecture including a tier of flash.   Virtualized or non-virtualized, standardizing on in-server flash is vital for optimizing performance, scalability, efficiency (technical and cost), reliability,  availability.  Learn how flash flips the /faster bit  the significant impact flash makes not just in terms of performance, but also best practices,  the massive savings in licensing driven by consolidation on flash.

## Title: Top 10 Clustering Dos and Don'ts
 
**Abstract**:
Clustering SQL Server still vexes many in one way or another. For some, it is even worse now that both AlwaysOn features - clustered instances (FCIs) and availability groups (AGs) - require an underlying Windows Server failover cluster. Storage, networking, Active Directory quorum, and more are topics that come up quite often. Learn from one of the world's experts on clustering SQL Server some the most important items - both good and bad - that you need to do to be successful whether you are creating an FCI, AG, or combining both together in one solution.

## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs
 
**Abstract**:
If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.
