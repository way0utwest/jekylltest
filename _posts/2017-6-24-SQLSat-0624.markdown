##Title: Accelerating DevOps and TDM Using Data Virtualization##
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps is the merger of app development, testing, and IT ops.  All tasks from coding to testing to operations should be automated so new features and fixes can be continuously quickly.

Test Data Management (TDM) is the optimization of the process of software quality, ensuring that applications properly work according to their specifications.

Constraining both DevOps and TDM is database size. "Storage is cheap" is not merely a lie, but more to the point it takes a lot of time to push terabytes around from place to place, and time itself is expensive and dear.

Providing full databases for each developer or tester on each task of each project seems unrealistic, when each copy might require terabytes of storage, so for decades everyone has limited themselves to working in shared dev/test environments that are refreshed only every few months, where conflicts occur,  quality suffers, and things move slowly.

Come learn why data virtualization is the solution to a problem everyone knows.

##Title: How To Be The DBA When You Don't Have A DBA##
 
**Abstract**:
Not everyone has a full time Database Administrator on staff, and in many cases the responsibility of managing the database server falls on you, the developers.  But as long as the backups are running successfully you're good, right?  Not exactly.  There is ongoing maintenance required to help ensure that your databases are running smoothly.  Are your statistics out of date?  Are your indexes fragmented?  When was the last time the databases were checked for corruption? Has your SQL Server been tuned to fit your workload, or are you still running with the less optimal default settings?

Tailored to the "Non-DBA", this session will cover these topics and more to ensure that you can avoid some performance issues you may not even realize you're having.  Discussing server settings, database configurations, and recommended maintenance, you will leave this session with the knowledge (and scripts!) you need to help ensure that your SQL Server and databases are in top shape.

##Title: On-Demand Creation of Dev/Test Databases with SQL Clone##
 
**Abstract**:
Imagine a world where developers and testers could run production-like environments on their own workstations, created on-demand and self-serviced. Raising tickets and waiting hours or days to get operations to deliver test databases would be a thing of the past. 

With Redgate's new tool, SQL Clone, this world now exists. Administrators and developers can create their own database copies in seconds using just MEGABYTES of disk space without ever touching production. Developers can see how their application behaves in a production-scale environment during both development and troubleshooting and operations no longer need to find disk space, provision, etc.

In this session we will examine how SQL Clone uses disk virtualization to enable quick, easy and even automated creation of database copies that are just MB in size.

##Title: I like big data for $400  - Exploring quiz show questions using Angular, DocumentDB and Azure Search##
 
**Abstract**:
In this talk, we will explore two powerful technologies from the Microsoft Azure Stack: DocumentDB and Azure Search. DocumentDB is Microsoft's NoSQL service for building globally scalable schema-free applications. Azure Search allows you to integrate the power of Microsoft's search and natural language processing abilities to explore your complex data stores. During this talk we will cover the benefits of implementing a schema-free database, we will learn how to replicate your data at a global scale with the ease of a simple configuration and we will cover various techniques of querying that data using SQL and the DocumentDB API. Once we have a large datastore in place (we will use 200k+ Jeopardy questions), we will apply the powerful natural language querying capabilities and faceted search features of Azure Search to quickly create an searchable data repository. All of this will be built and exposed using a cross-platform application built in Angular on the Electron framework.

I find that I am most passionate about the Admin and HA/DR side, but will still dive into design when called upon.   

The Azure cloud is exciting and I believe is the future of SQL Server.   I love teaching new and accidental DBAs all of the things I didn't know when I started.

I find that I am most passionate about the Admin and HA/DR side, but will still dive into design when called upon.   

The Azure cloud is exciting and I believe is the future of SQL Server.   I love teaching new and accidental DBAs all of the things I didn't know when I started.

I have been working with Microsoft Database technologies since 1994, in Design, Data Modeling, Development and Administration.  18 years of that time have been with SQL Server, going all the way back to 6.5.   

I find that I am most passionate about the Admin and HA/DR side, but will still dive into design when called upon.   

The Azure cloud is exciting and I believe is the future of SQL Server.   I love teaching new and accidental DBAs all of the things I didn't know when I started.

##Title: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Automating Your BI Framework##
 
**Abstract**:
Quite frankly, some aspects of building out a business intelligence solution are tedious. As you cycle through iterations of your star schema, you’ll find that even a simple data type change in the data warehouse requires you to make corresponding changes to staging tables, and SSIS packages that take a considerable amount of time to implement. But there’s a better, faster way!In this session, we’ll explore lessons from a project that required implementation of a framework to easily generate BI objects based on reusable patterns. We’ll walk through the decision points in the framework design, review the implementation steps, and see demonstrations of how easily you can make iterative changes to your BI solution’s design by using reusable design patterns. Whether you simply want to accelerate change management or reproduce objects in bulk on demand, this session will give you practical tips for automating these processes.

##Title: New Instance, Now what?##
 
**Abstract**:
Congratulations, you’re now our DBA!   A new SQL instance is like a blank canvas, you stare at it and wonder where to start.  As an accidental dba, this session will help you learn how to survive in your new role.

In this session, you will be supplied with the beginning brush strokes to make your server a master piece. To do so, we will review best practices for standard configurations, backups, maintenance, and disaster recovery. 

By the end of this session, you will have developed a pallet of tools to help you create your SQL Server Masterpiece and be able to use it as a print for others.

I have been working with Microsoft Database technologies since 1994, in Design, Data Modeling, Development and Administration.  18 years of that time have been with SQL Server, going all the way back to 6.5.   

I find that I am most passionate about the Admin and HA/DR side, but will still dive into design when called upon.   

The Azure cloud is exciting and I believe is the future of SQL Server.   I love teaching new and accidental DBAs all of the things I didn't know when I started.

##Title: 5 Ways to Bypass or Ensure Security##
 
**Abstract**:
In this class, we will walk through 5 ways you can bypass SQL Server security, but then we will also demonstrate how to close off those loopholes. You will be surprised at some of the tactics presented and might even recognize a past experience based on one of the loopholes presented. Inevitably, even some of the best SQL security professionals will walk out with a face-palm and realize they’ve got a lot of work to do come Monday morning to plug these loopholes.

##Title: Querying Semistructured Data in Azure Data Lake with USQL##
 
**Abstract**:
Data is exploding across enterprises.  Much of it is semi-structured junk.  Or is it junk?  What are you going to do with it until you can find out?  Microsoft’s Azure Data Lake is a cloud storage and analytical service for parking a variety of data.  When you are ready, you can query that semi-structured data using an ANSI SQL language called U-SQL.  In this session I will demonstrate the similarities and differences between U-SQL and T-SQL.  I will demonstrate how easy it is to build a query against 21 GB of CSV files. Such queries can help you determine whether you have a gold mine in your data or a bunch of garbage before investing in a full data warehouse build.

##Title: Database Design Fundamentals##
 
**Abstract**:
Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years, but are often thought of as old-fashioned. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against these standards and can be avoided by understanding the requirements, applying normalization, as well as a healthy dose of simple common sense. In this session I will give an overview of how to design a relational database, allowing you to work with the data structures instead of against them. This will let you use SQL naturally, enabling the query engine internals to optimize your output needs without you needing to spend a lot of time thinking about it. This will mean less time trying to figure out why SUBSTRING(column,3,1) = 'A' is killing your performance, and more time for solving the next customer problem.

##Title: Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks; Tame the Sibling Rivalry##
 
**Abstract**:
Like parents having to break up a fight between battling siblings, SQL Server must do the same for conflicting transactions. We call these Deadlocks and they can present a problem to many DBAs. Deadlocks can be minor fights or major issues making SQL Server continually choose a side like constantly quarreling siblings.

To understand how Deadlocking occurs, we must understand what caused the fight . Learning about basic locking and blocking of SQL Server is a great place to start.

By the end of this session you will walk away with the knowledge of how the locking/blocking mechanism works, the basics of deadlocking, and what Isolation Levels are . You will know how these can help or hurt your situation.  Finally you will have the power to capture, report, and stop the family fighting.

I find that I am most passionate about the Admin and HA/DR side, but will still dive into design when called upon.   

The Azure cloud is exciting and I believe is the future of SQL Server.   I love teaching new and accidental DBAs all of the things I didn't know when I started.

##Title: 45 Minutes to Your First SSAS Tabular Model##
 
**Abstract**:
Have you been watching SSAS Tabular develop? What about the new Azure Analysis Services product? Or you've looked at these and like what they can add in Power BI or classic BI scenarios, but haven't had a chance to dive in and figure all of this out? Now is the time!
SSAS Tabular is a new-ish form of business intelligence model released with SQL Server 2012, intended as an alternative to more traditional Multidimensional cubes. In this session, we will talk briefly about what Tabular is and what it does, in addition to the various options for deployment, before exploring the development process of creating a tabular model ready for ad-hoc querying through Excel or Power BI.

I have been working with Microsoft Database technologies since 1994, in Design, Data Modeling, Development and Administration.  18 years of that time have been with SQL Server, going all the way back to 6.5.   

I find that I am most passionate about the Admin and HA/DR side, but will still dive into design when called upon.   

The Azure cloud is exciting and I believe is the future of SQL Server.   I love teaching new and accidental DBAs all of the things I didn't know when I started.

##Title: Using Biml to Automate the Generation of SSIS Packages##
 
**Abstract**:
So you need to move data from 75 tables on the mainframe to new tables in SQL Azure.  Do you: a) hand code one package to load all 75 tables, b) hand code 75 packages that move a table each, or c) wish there was a better way?
There is!  Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) can automate the creation of packages so that they all follow the same script.  In this beginner level session, we will create some simple metadata to be able to generate multiple packages and their associated connection managers.  You will see Biml in action.  You will see the XML that Biml uses to define packages and connections.  You will see the C# code that Biml uses to fetch metadata and dynamically generate packages in SSIS. And you will see packages and connection managers generated from Biml before your very eyes.

##Title: PowerShell Non-Monolithic Script Module Design##
 
**Abstract**:
Creating a script module in PowerShell is a very simplistic process, but there are a number of reasons why you might not want to create one huge monolithic PSM1 script module file that contains all of your module’s functions. During this session, Microsoft MVP Mike F Robbins will demonstrate how to separate each of your module’s functions into its own dedicated PS1 file that’s dot-sourced from your script module’s PSM1 file along with discussing this design methodology and the challenges that it creates. Many times resolving one problem seems to create more problems such as cmdlets from other modules showing up as being exported by your module. The solution to these problems and more will be provided during this session. Mike will also demonstrate using a Pester test to validate that all of the functions are indeed exported along with using a function to help automate the module manifest update process when additional functions are added to your module.

##Title: Why should I care about ... the plan cache?##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.

I have been working with Microsoft Database technologies since 1994, in Design, Data Modeling, Development and Administration.  18 years of that time have been with SQL Server, going all the way back to 6.5.   

I find that I am most passionate about the Admin and HA/DR side, but will still dive into design when called upon.   

The Azure cloud is exciting and I believe is the future of SQL Server.   I love teaching new and accidental DBAs all of the things I didn't know when I started.

##Title: Performance Monitoring SQL Server Analysis Services##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) servers need continued maintenance and monitoring post deployment to production; however, many projects forgo this part and the overall system performance can suffer. 

Join this session to learn how to monitor and evaluate the performance of your SSAS server. You will learn what to measure and how to determine acceptable ranges of those measurements for your environment. You will see demos of Task Manager, Perfmon and SQL Server Extended Events to get insights into your SSAS server’s health, identify the most common issues in production, and make recommendations for changes to SSAS developers on your team.

If you have experience with SSAS development and are interested in learning about SSAS from the server side, this session is for you.  This session focuses on SQL Server Analysis Services in multidimensional mode but many of the concepts apply to tabular mode as well.

I have been working with Microsoft Database technologies since 1994, in Design, Data Modeling, Development and Administration.  18 years of that time have been with SQL Server, going all the way back to 6.5.   

I find that I am most passionate about the Admin and HA/DR side, but will still dive into design when called upon.   

The Azure cloud is exciting and I believe is the future of SQL Server.   I love teaching new and accidental DBAs all of the things I didn't know when I started.

##Title: Self Service BI – ETL and More From A Business Unit User’s Perspective##
 
**Abstract**:
A business user is responsible for implementing a new electric power system modeling application and has to gather data from hundreds of diverse sources to set up the model.  Reference data sources included a multitude of different data types, including historical time series, commodity forward pricing curves, and power plant operating characteristics.  The user discovers the “power’ in Power Query and is able to meet the implementation deadline due to the Power Query’s rich tool set.  The business user continues to find Power Query to be a useful tool in daily tasks as a Power System Resource Planning Specialist.  Witness practical examples of Power Query’s Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) functionality applied to getting and reshaping data to perform the analyst’s daily tasks.

##Title: Making Your List and Checking It Twice: Introduction to unit testing with tSQLt##
 
**Abstract**:
Unit testing allows database code to be consistently tested during the development process, but it can be challenging to get unit testing setup for database development. This session will give an overview on the purpose of unit testing, the installation of the tSQLt framework, and the design of unit tests. I will use general concepts of test driven design to create and run unit tests to confirm that objects exist and to test single and multiple test cases. Learn how to implement unit testing in a development environment and create and run your own units tests.

I have been working with Microsoft Database technologies since 1994, in Design, Data Modeling, Development and Administration.  18 years of that time have been with SQL Server, going all the way back to 6.5.   

I find that I am most passionate about the Admin and HA/DR side, but will still dive into design when called upon.   

The Azure cloud is exciting and I believe is the future of SQL Server.   I love teaching new and accidental DBAs all of the things I didn't know when I started.

##Title: Leveraging SQL Server R Services to Perform Advanced Analytics##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2016 is packed with many great features. One of those features is the integration of R in SQL Server via SQL Server R Services. This integration gives us the ability to perform very sophisticated analytics against data inside the database and data warehoused in big data environments such as Spark  Hadoop. 

In this session I will demonstrate how to productionize models developed by your data scientist via SQL Server R Services. I will demonstrate how to manage the whole process using an IDE that many of us have grown to love, Visual Studio.

##Title: R-ternatives in Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
R is a very powerful statistical programming language that has been gaining a lot of traction in recent years. In early 2015 Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics, a major provider of software and services for R. Microsoft have since incorporated R in Azure ML, SQL Server 2016, and Power BI. 

There are 3 ways you can leverage R in Power BI. You can use it as a data source, you can leverage it in Power Query, and you can use it to create custom visualizations. In this session I present easy to follow examples of those 3 scenarios. I will also provide resources that will enable you to take what you learned to the next level.

I have been working with Microsoft Database technologies since 1994, in Design, Data Modeling, Development and Administration.  18 years of that time have been with SQL Server, going all the way back to 6.5.   

I find that I am most passionate about the Admin and HA/DR side, but will still dive into design when called upon.   

The Azure cloud is exciting and I believe is the future of SQL Server.   I love teaching new and accidental DBAs all of the things I didn't know when I started.

I have been working with Microsoft Database technologies since 1994, in Design, Data Modeling, Development and Administration.  18 years of that time have been with SQL Server, going all the way back to 6.5.

##Title: SQL Server 2017 (Linux and Beyond)##
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft has leveled the RDBMS playing field, with SQL Server vNext  (aka SQL Server 2017), allowing you to deploy and run SQL Server on a variety of operating systems and container solutions.

In this session, we will look at the background of SQL Server’s move to non-Windows platforms, cover how to install using package deployment on Linux and image-containers with Docker.  Focus will cover administration and tools that you can leverage while running SQL Server on non-Windows platforms, including migration and current feature function limitations.

##Title: A Tour of Cloud Data Platforms as a Service##
 
**Abstract**:
With the proliferation of SQL, NoSQL and Big Data databases, organizations can now target specific fit-for-purpose database platforms that align with their particular application requirements regarding scalability, elasticity, functionality and manageability. Platform as a Service offerings make this even easier now, enabling developers to roll out their own database infrastructure in minutes with minimal management overhead. However, this same amount of flexibility also comes with the challenges of picking the right tool, on the right provider and with the proper expectations.

I have been working with Microsoft Database technologies since 1994, in Design, Data Modeling, Development and Administration.  18 years of that time have been with SQL Server, going all the way back to 6.5.   

I find that I am most passionate about the Admin and HA/DR side, but will still dive into design when called upon.   

The Azure cloud is exciting and I believe is the future of SQL Server.   I love teaching new and accidental DBAs all of the things I didn't know when I started.

##Title: Excel with DAX##
 
**Abstract**:
DAX is the new formula language (builds upon Excel's) supporting PowerPivot and Analysis Services Tabular mode. If you know Excel, you already know the basics of DAX (without even knowing it).  PowerBI also uses DAX for all the formula expressions.  We'll cover the basics of DAX, and go over some time intelligence functions.

I have been working with Microsoft Database technologies since 1994, in Design, Data Modeling, Development and Administration.  18 years of that time have been with SQL Server, going all the way back to 6.5.   

I find that I am most passionate about the Admin and HA/DR side, but will still dive into design when called upon.   

The Azure cloud is exciting and I believe is the future of SQL Server.   I love teaching new and accidental DBAs all of the things I didn't know when I started.

##Title: SQL Server Security model, in plain English##
 
**Abstract**:
What is the difference between a Login and a User?  What is a schema? Why can I view one table but not another?

If the security portion of SQL Server is confusing to you, you are not alone.  Join me for a short overview of the SQL Server security model, using non-technical terms.  We will look at it from the point of view of something we are all familiar with, so that you will remember it 6 months or a year or more down the road.

This will be a highly interactive session, designed for you to be able to absorb the info without having to take notes.   Bring coffee and learn!
