##Title: Eyes on the Prize:  Simple and Effective Dashboard Visualization Techniques##
 
**Abstract**:
When done right, data visualization informs users quickly and efficiently with a minimum of distraction.  When done wrong, we end up with spinning 3D pie charts.  In this talk, we will look at techniques for effective dashboard design, minimizing noise and clutter (like spinning 3D pie charts) while providing relevant information to the intended audience.  We will see how different types of charts work, build out rules of thumb around which charts to use, and integrate visuals to create a coherent dashboard image.  When it comes to dashboards, we will compare and contrast dashboards based on their intended uses, such as interactive dashboards versus TV dashboards.  Finally, we will take an awful dashboard and turn it into something which end users will appreciate.

##Title: Getting started with SQL Azure Database: What you need to know##
 
**Abstract**:
Azure SQL Database offers a way to quickly spin up new databases with minimal management requirements. However, the number of differences between on-premises SQL Server and Azure SQL Database can be overwhelming. Even worse, with DBaaS it’s not clear who is responsible for what anymore.
In this session, we will cover all the basic steps of getting your first Azure SQL Database instance spun up. We’ll cover common gotchas, like firewall settings and resource locks. We’ll also dive into some more advanced options with templates, allowing you to make your processes reproducible.
By the end of this presentation, you’ll understand if Azure SQL Database is the right choice for you and your needs. You’ll understand how it can simplify management and allow you to scale easily. Finally, you’ll have the confidence to go and create your own instance with ease.

##Title: Hack / Protect / Predict SQL Server - Come learn them.##
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, I'll show you how to hack SQL Server using a simple C# console application and other tools. Most importantly, I'll show you how to protect vectors that perhaps you're trying to use to safeguard sensitive data for GDPR compliance.
 
1. Tabular Data Stream (TDS) Protocol
2. Dynamic Data Masking
3. Row Level Security (Yep...)
4. Database Source Control
 
Perhaps, you've seen these exploits before but do you really know how to reproduce them? Or, how to even protect yourself against them? No worries, I'll show you the way along with a load test.
 
Finally, I am very excited to share with you how to analyze text using pre-trained Machine Learning models to predict a sentiment, on-prem with SQL Server 2017.
 
5. SQL ML / AI - A deep dive to predict the sentiment
 
Looking forward to meeting you all.

##Title: Patterns for Managing Your Career Learning Needs##
 
**Abstract**:
Most of us want to "keep up" with changes in the technologies we use and most of us feel like we're failing to do so. Can that be right? Is it possible to learn what what we need to learn in order to stay current and still have time for a life outside of work? It is!

This presentation is about patterns you can apply to how and when you learn. My goal is to give you the ideas and techniques that will help you learn effectively and do so for your entire career - something you can use for 40 years!

Attendees - bring your lists. Bring the list of stuff of you want to learn or think you should learn. Take a few minutes to write down the challenges you've had in 'keeping up'. We'll discuss some during the session and I'll be available afterward for one on one conversations for the rest!

##Title: Quick and Dirty Push Datasets with Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
Using Power BI, you can connect to hundreds of different data sources.  Once you have published your data to the Power BI service, you can use an on-premises gateway to refresh your datasets up to every 15 minutes.  Power BI can also connect live to large cubes that are a result of very complex ETL and calculations.  Some of these cubes may only be refreshed daily or weekly.  For real-time streaming of data, you can use Azure Stream Analytics or the Power BI REST API.  

Have you heard of Power BI push datasets?  With push datasets, data is pushed into the Power BI service.  Since it is stored there, you can use all of Power BI's report building features with it.

In this session, I walk through the different options for real-time streaming in Power BI.  I will demonstrate setting up a push dataset and show you a very easy way to push data to Power BI using PowerShell.  I will also demonstrate a Power BI push dataset connected to a Microsoft Cognitive Services Computer Vision app.

##Title: I know what you did last transaction: Auditing using CDC, Temporal Tables and Triggers##
 
**Abstract**:
There have been more advancements in the topic of auditing SQL inserts, updates and deletes during the past few years than in the nearly 30-year history of SQL Server. Eric Berkowitz presents a fast-paced, live demonstration and comparison of Change Data Capture, the new SQL Temporal Tables and conventional trigger-based methods. Gain the ability to audit, research and report on data changes, without recoding existing applications and proactively plan for auditing in new systems. Understand the overhead and performance implications and storage and retention options for each approach. See how querying, DDL changes and compatibility considerations vary among the methods so you can make informed decisions about implementing auditing in your system.

##Title: So You think You can Speak?##
 
**Abstract**:
If you've ever enjoyed or admired the knowledge and know-how of a speaker at a SQL Saturday or a Summit , remember that they started where you are, with an interest in SQL and I.T. topics, a passion to learn more, but also with the desire to share what they know with their peers.
If you have an interest in SQL or any of the Microsoft Data platform technologies, and have learned something useful in your I.T. career, consider giving back to the community by sharing what you know. While it may seem intimidating to give an hour long talk at an event like this, remember that every great speaker had to start somewhere. And for you, maybe that start is here! 
"Do You Think You can Speak" is a friendly competition for anyone, even first time speakers, to share for 5 - 10 minutes on a technical topic, SQL, Business Intelligence, Power BI, or otherwise, that is informative, useful, and entertaining.

##Title: Dell: #GetModern with Dell EMC##
 
**Abstract**:
Consistent and predictable performance is critical for any successful deployment of Microsoft SQL Server. All-Flash arrays have been available for years and sub-millisecond response times should be the expectation. Maximize the performance and agility of your environment and learn how to automate and leverage self-service for snapshots of your databases for protection and re-purposing. Test/dev infrastructures can be refreshed from production DBs in minutes rather than hours or days. Stop working harder and slower than you need to be, learn how you can leverage Dell EMC. Whether storage, servers, networking, data protection, converged or hyper-converged…  we have you covered.

##Title: Data Science, and the changing Role of Data professionals; Data-Information-Knowledge and Wisdom##
 
**Abstract**:
Data Science techniques are becoming popular and because statistics usually teaches at the Math Department people think of it as an exact science but Statistic is the science of prediction and expectations. In the excitement of the possibilities that Big Data technology and Data Science techniques are opening, we are forgetting that correlation is not equal than causation and that any design model has intrinsic limitations. 
Dr. Deming said "In God we trust, all others must bring data." but what he really wanted to reach was Wisdom! Data is just the raw material the real goal is Wisdom I have been thinking about the chain toward Wisdom (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) and wonder how many organizations have reached, at least, the level of Knowledge and if any at all have reached the pinnacle of Wisdom. 
We are drowning in a sea of data and we are starving for wisdom.
How is Data Science and Big Data changing our profession? What is a Data Scientist? Which skills do we need?

##Title: Applied Machine Learning with Python##
 
**Abstract**:
The Applied Machine Learning with Python session covers some basic concepts, tools and a workflow used to explore, visualize, develop a model to attain answers from data. 

This is an introduction designed for those with minimal or no Machine Learning experience. It is also an applied session focused on getting answers from data, and it does not emphasize the Math behind the ML model.

##Title: New Instance, Now what?##
 
**Abstract**:
Congratulations, you’re now our DBA!   A new SQL instance is like a blank canvas, you stare at it and wonder where to start.  As an accidental dba, this session will help you learn how to survive in your new role.

In this session, you will be supplied with the beginning brush strokes to make your server a master piece. To do so, we will review best practices for standard configurations, backups, maintenance, and disaster recovery. 

By the end of this session, you will have developed a pallet of tools to help you create your SQL Server Masterpiece and be able to use it as a print for others.

##Title: Cautionary Tale of Recompilations, Excessive CPU Load and Plan Caching##
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server reduces compilation and optimization overhead by caching and reusing execution plans for the queries. Plan caching helps to reduce CPU load on the server; however, it may also introduce unexpected issues and lead to suboptimal execution plans and performance problems.  

In this session, Dmitri will explain how plan caching works internally and demonstrate how to address several common issues related to the plan caching. He will talk about parameter sniffing, simple and forced parameterization, OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN strategy, and several other related topics.    Finally, Dmitri will provide the guidelines how to reduce CPU load and recompilation overhead in the systems with heavy ad-hoc workload and non-parameterized queries.

##Title: Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Services, and Power BI##
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft Cognitive services is a series of services based on Microsoft Research using Deep Learning techniques, ready for you to enrich your unstructured data. Microsoft Services includes: Vision (Computer Vision, Emotion, Face, Video), Speech/Language (Speaker Recognition, Spell, Sentiment, Language, Key Phrases, Topic detection, Linguistic Analysis), Knowledge, and Search. These services are consumed by using the Cognitive Services APIs. Power BI enables you to consume the APIs to enrich your unstructured data inside your Power BI solutions. During this session, we will cover how to consume the API using Power Query to then visualize the results with Power BI visuals. We will also consume the Cognitive services API by using a R script inside Power BI. This session is structured with a B2C Survey case study solution with a real time Dashboard using a streaming dataset.

##Title: DataGrip IDE: How your tool can help writing SQL##
 
**Abstract**:
Now IDEs on IntelliJ-platform are one of the most popular tools for developers. More than two million people use IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm and other IDEs. At the same time, they use various SQL clients for writing and executing statements. But working with SQL is possible just from these IDEs. There is also a stand-alone IDE for SQL called DataGrip which was created based on a huge expertise in code-insight which JetBrains, IntelliJ creators, have. In this session, I will briefly show main tips and tricks of using database support inside IDE's based on IntelliJ platform. 

— Tips for writing and executing statements
— Editing data from UI
— Using code completion and code inspections
— Comparing result-sets
— Searching through database objects
— Navigating through data
— and other features.

##Title: Using PowerBi to troubleshoot SQL Server instances##
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI is the hottest new tool for data insights. While PSSDIAG and SQLNexus are go-to tools used by Microsoft engineers and 3rd party Consultants to gather a wealth of performance data from SQL Server, displaying and analyzing that data is not a trivial task. 
Participants will learn how to configure a performance collection, how to collect and analyze performance data and use Power BI to review SQL Server bottleneck that are exposed by the interactive visual experience Power BI offers.

##Title: Improve Your Knowledge of the Optimizer and Statistics!##
 
**Abstract**:
What is the Optimizer, what does it have to do with Statistics?? Database Engines rely on an algorithm to determine the best way to access data.   The power to influence how the data is accessed to achieve the best SQL performance possible is in your hands!!  Focusing on the Optimizer and Statistics, many techniques and tools are available to assist report writers, developers and DBA's in achieving the optimal paths to the data.  I will give you the education you need to consider the options, and a portal into how the optimizer works to help your code work with the optimizer to achieve the better performance.

##Title: Brand yourself like a pro 2.0 "How to tell the story"##
 
**Abstract**:
There are many "social media outlets" but not all of them are "the right one" for you, especially if you don't have a brand. 
Building a brand has to be intentional. You cannot just be you. Discovering the things that make you unique is not enough. You have to package these things in a way that highlights and perhaps even over exaggerates them.
In this interactive session, you will learn how to use Social Media to create your personal brand to positioning yourself as a pro, telling the story in the way that the people want to hear at the same time that you increase your self-confidence.

##Title: APPLY Yourself##
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.

##Title: Much Ado About Hadoop##
 
**Abstract**:
If you're interested in Hadoop but don't know where to begin, this session will give you an idea of what you can do with the open-source platform.  We will see an overview of the Hadoop architecture, becoming familiar with the overall platform and its solutions for warehousing, ETL, streaming data ingest, in-memory processing, and more.  We will compare Hadoop to SQL Server to help gain an understanding of when to deploy which technology.

##Title: Database Backup and Restore Best Practices##
 
**Abstract**:
Backups are a vital part of any DBA's job. Acting as the "last line of defense", we rely on backups to safeguard the company's most important asset: the data. But how do we know we're managing our backups appropriately? This session will cover the fundamental principles of building out our backup (and restore strategy), covering the "why" of backups and best practices for our data protection.
