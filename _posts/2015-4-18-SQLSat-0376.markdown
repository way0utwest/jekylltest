## Title: Kis hazugság, nagy hazugság, statisztika, avagy hogyan működik a Query Optimizer?
 
**Abstract**:
A jól ismert mondás a végrehajtási tervekkel kapcsolatban is igaznak bizonyul. Statisztikailag az SQL Server az esetek többségében jó végrehajtási tervet készít, viszont van amikor bődületesen rosszat. A Query Optimizer felelős a végrehajtási tervek optimalizálásáért. Az elküldött SQL utasításokból ez a komponens állít elő egy "elég jó" végrehajtási tervet. Nem a legeslegjobbat. Végignéz néhány lehetséges változatot és azokból próbálja megbecsülni, hogy melyik lesz elég jó. Ha a becslés nem csúszik félre, akkor jó tervet kaphatunk, ha viszont igen, akkor nagyon átverve szoktuk érezni magunkat.

Az előadásban azt fogjuk megnézni, hogy milyen szerepük van az indexeknek és a statisztikáknak a becslésben és a végrehajtási terv kiválasztásában.

## Title: My Favorite Pie (Chart)
 
**Abstract**:
Pies are definitely fine for dessert :-) – but sometimes also used for reports, even if their real use case is very narrow. Do you want deliver information in an effective and efficient way? Do you think, this is crucial for you a business’ success? Even when attractiveness of a report is important, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Research shows that we can help end-users to understand the message of the data quickly by following some simple rules. You will see how you can implement those rules with different tools of Microsoft’s BI stack – ending up with effective and efficient information delivering through beautiful dashboards. You will learn how to identify suboptimal dashboards and what you can do to improve them.

## Title: Azure SQL DB Resource Management
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft Azure SQL Database is a relational database-as-a-service that delivers predictable performance, scalability, business continuity and data protection for cloud developers. Azure SQL Database service is built on shared resources from thousands of physical machines at Microsoft Data Centers. Each physical machine host many databases; availability and performance for each database can vary based on other activities on the physical machine. Azure SQL Database uses some techniques to manage resources and provide a stable system with optimal usage of physical servers.
I will overview the architectural layers and internals of Azure SQL Database and then focus on resource management techniques like load balancing, engine throttling, using resource governor to isolate load on physical machines. We will go over resource limitations on Azure SQL Database like memory usage, database size, transaction duration and Temp DB usage. Finally, we will conclude with best practices

## Title: High Performance Statistical Queries
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Database Engine has so many business intelligence improvements that it might become your primary analytical database system. However, in order to get the maximum out of these features, you need to learn how to properly use them. This in-depth session shows some extremely efficient inventive algorithms for the statistical queries. The queries use Window functions, CLR aggregate functions, and other SQL Server capabilities. The session also explains the formulas and usage of those statistical procedures. This session is useful not only for BI developers; database and other developers can successfully learn how to write efficient queries as well.

## Title: Tips and Tricks for Maintenance Optimization
 
**Abstract**:
Probably, all of us have received a notice that the performance of their SQL Server is not running at the expected level. There are hundreds of reasons why this is the case but we need to start our check with the most simple one - how is our maintenance organized? Are we using the most suitable schedule and setup? We will explore how you can improve your maintenance's efficiency and explore some tricks for VLDBs.

## Title: Adatbázis baseline adatok gyűjtése
 
**Abstract**:
A DBA mindennapi munkája során sokszor szembesülhet olyan problémákkal, melyek megoldása sokkal egyszrűbb lenne, ha az SQL Server aktuális állapotát, teljesítmény adatait össze tudná hasonlítani egy korábbi állapottal, az úgynevezett baseline-al. Az előadás során megvizsgáljuk, hogy milyen adatokat érdemes gyűjteni, valamint bemutatásra kerül egy ingyenes scriptgyűjtemény, mely segítségével ezt könnyen meg is tehetjük.

## Title: SSIS Custom Data Flow Components
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) include several most important components required in data acquisition, transformation, and load operations. If the problem at hand demands a solution that cannot be solved using the built-in components alone, you can resort to the freely extensible Script Component, but when the circumstances also call for a more complex, and more robust solution, that will be deployed to more than one destination server, the more appropriate alternative is to design a Custom Component.In this session you will learn how this can be achieved, what advantages it provides, and how to perform even the most complex data transformations in a standardised and reliable environment.

## Title: Common TSQL Mistakes
 
**Abstract**:
We are going to examine a variety of oopsies MANY developers fall prey too - some obvious, some pretty subtle and some down right sneaky! Lots of code examples with the bad AND good code presented. I GUARANTEE that you will find things here that will either prevent you from getting bad data, throwing unwanted errors or vastly improving your database application's performance.  I have given this talk over SEVENTY times now and it is always very highly rated!

## Title: How to recover deleted data with no backups?
 
**Abstract**:
From time to time on the forums emerge people in really tough situation: data is deleted, database is in SIMPLE recovery model, and as a cherry on top - there is no backup! It might be boss's private database that nobody has put into backup scheme yet, or some new database that was missing from the backup scheme.
It is nearly impossible to recover the lost data from that situation. But I will show you at least three methods. After this presentation, you will be prepared to solve such a tough case. It is really important to know two simple steps you must do really fast, and after that you can relax and extract the data with peace of mind and without time pressure.

## Title: Önkiszolgáló BI az üzleti felhasználók szemével
 
**Abstract**:
Az önkiszolgáló BI (Self Service BI) napjaink egyik legfelkapottabb üzleti intelligencia trendje. De vajon mi van mögötte? Valós innováció, vagy csak egy újabb marketing kifejezés? Tényleg lehet Excellel több tízmillió soros döntéstámogató rendszert építeni vagy csak az Excel felhasználók játékszerét misztifikálják túl? Az előadáson választ keresünk ezekre a kérdésekre és közben az üzleti felhasználók szemüvegén keresztül vizsgáljuk meg azt, hogy milyen lehetőségeket nyújt Nekik az Excel Power Pivot bővítményébe rejtett oszlopalapú, memóriában futó adatbázis kezelő.

## Title: SQL Server and Application Security for Developers
 
**Abstract**:
A lot of companies have a philosophy of "ship early with as many features as possible.” Security is an afterthought since it isn't fun to do and no one will attack them anyway. However, the dark side never sleeps, and security breaches have always happened, often leaving companies severely exposed or even bankrupt.
In this session we'll look at a few attack vectors that can be used against your company, and what you as a developer can and should do to protect against them. It will involve a good mix of security conscious SQL Server and application development, because you care about your work and nobody messes with you.

## Title: No more waiting – an introduction to SQL Server wait statistics
 
**Abstract**:
When you are standing in line at the grocery store you know exactly what you’re waiting for, paying the things you intend to buy. In SQL Server things aren’t usually so simple and many times you have to wait for more than only the length of the queue or the speed of the cashier. Thankfully SQL Server gathers the exact time you have been waiting and what resource you have been waiting on. In this session we will take a look at how SQL Server gathers this information and how it can help you identify, troubleshoot and proactively solve performance issues.
