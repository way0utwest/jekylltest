## Title: Mobile BI with SSRS and SharePoint
 
**Abstract**:
Today's executives and information workers want to use mobile devices to get at their business information, make critical decisions, and thrive. Let's help them get there with SQL Server Reporting Services and SharePoint. Tablets are common place now, and smart phones have been in place for years, but have we devoted enough attention to make effective use of the new form factors? Let's discuss how our design approach changes when we want to launch mission-critical dashboards and reports on smaller screen sizes using touch-screen technology. We'll look at iPad and other mobile devices, SSRS and SharePoint, BI Developer and Business User, with emphasis on data visualization best practices.

## Title: SQL Server 2012 Memory Manager Changes
 
**Abstract**:
The SQLOS component is an internal user mode OS enrichment layer for SQL Server that delivers necessary system level services such as co-operative user mode scheduling, memory management, deadlock detection and exception handling to SQL Server components. One of the investments we made for SQL Server 2012 is to refactor the Memory Manager subcomponent in SQLOS to allow users to predictably size the SQL Server memory consumption in addition to performance  scalability improvements. Come learn about what this change means for sizing memory for workloads in SQL Server 2012. You will also hear about related DMV and performance counter changes for this improvement.

## Title: BISM Partitions, Security and Hierarchies
 
**Abstract**:
PowerPivot took end users a long way towards creating some amazing self-service data models that we are starting to find are very valuable to the business.  Now how do we take these models to the next level and truly allow enterprise access to something that may have just lived in a team site previously?  This is where the new features of Business Intelligence Semantic Models (BISM) come into play.  We will take a BISM model from its baseline roots of a PowerPivot and drive it to the enterprise level showcasing partitioning, security, and hierarchies while explaining how these will come into play in a real world business scenario.

## Title: Documenting Your Integrated Microsoft BI Solution
 
**Abstract**:
Having implemented BI solutions for years, I have found documentation to be a task too often resisted until late in the project, when it is hastily and incompletely prepared in remaining hours. Because the integrated Microsoft BI solution comprises multiple application layers, it is challenging to generate documentation about the whole solution in a single, unified document. In this presentation I will share approaches I’ve come to use in assembling documentation that “covers all the bases.”

## Title: "Ad Hoc Analytics – Can my customer do that?”
 
**Abstract**:
In a customer service based business world the newest feature being offered to clients in many industries is access to their data for ad hoc analytics.  Agile players in many industries are stealing away market share because of this additional feature they can offer and in turn is forcing big players in every industry to just keep up to hold their ground.  SQL Server 2012 will be in the middle of this battle and will give us the ability to deliver this feature without building the entire system from scratch.  This feature is brought to us by using the new Power View and Business Intelligence Semantic Model all surfaced using SharePoint 2010.

## Title: Transact-SQL does Windows
 
**Abstract**:
According to Itzik Ben-Gan: “Windowing functions are the best thing to happen since sliced bread”.  In SQL Server 2005, Microsoft introduced SQL Windowing into Transact-SQL with new ranking functions and existing aggregate functions.  This gave the Transact-SQL developer the ability to easily generate row numbers and compute sums, averages, etc. while returning detailed data rows.  But the ANSI/ISO SQL standard had defined additional windowing functionality and SQL Server 2012 now supports more of it. This includes the ability to frame the scope of the window and new functions like LAG, LEAD, FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE.  These enhancements extend the set-based functionality of Transact-SQL.

## Title: Stupid SQL and the Programmers that Write it
 
**Abstract**:
You work with smart people, but there you are in a code review of a co-worker's SQL ready to be rushed into production and it is so elaborately stupid that you don't know where to start. How did we get here? Why is the level of SQL literacy so low?
There are two goals in the session. First, we will look at lot's of stupid SQL. Second, we will talk about how to encourage co-workers to write better SQL.
Looking at stupid SQL can help even experienced programmers as we examine why something is wrong. Along the way, we note where SQL Server itself is stupid (e.g. the IsNumeric function) 
We will also look at some places where some subtleties of SQL can trip even an experienced Pro.

## Title: Understanding SQL Server XML Features 
 
**Abstract**:
The XML Functionality embedded into SQL Server 2005 and 2008 is one of its most powerful yet least understood features.  This seems to be primarily because DBA's shy away from it and developers prefer to work with XML in their code.  In this session we will explore the XML features of SQL Server and how we can bridge these two worlds. Topics covered will include retrieving relational data as XML, storing XML in the database using the XML Datatype, XML indexes, and the XQuery functions included in SQL Server.  We will also look at using XML as stored procedure parameters as a way to pass large amounts of complex data between client and server.

## Title: Become Bilingual! Oracle for the SQL Server DBA
 
**Abstract**:
In today's enterprise environments, it is becoming increasingly necessary to integrate data from a variety of sources. As SQL Server continues its march into the enterprise, the days of focusing 100% on one platform are over. At a bare minimum, we need to be able to communicate with DBA's for other platforms. Terminology as simple as Instance and Database mean very different things in Oracle than they do in SQL Server. In this session, we will compare and contrast the two platforms in terms of features and terminology. We will also discuss some of the best practices and pitfalls when integrating the two.

## Title: Many-to-Many: Multiple Calendars in a Single Cube
 
**Abstract**:
Including the fiscal calendars of major customers within the date dimensions of their own cubes has great appeal to many organizations, including financial services firms and the like. After all, having customer calendars in their cubes' date dimension means sales and marketing managers can analyze - and report upon - data according to the fiscal calendar of the customer, as well as within the context of their own. In this session, Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson leads an examination into a way we can accomplish this by implementing a SQL Server Analysis Services "many-to-many" dimension scenario.

## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs
 
**Abstract**:
If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

## Title: Using TVPs in .Net applications
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server introduced the ability to define TVPs (aka, User-Defined Table Types)  as a Read-Only parameter-type in stored procedures.

SQL Server on VMware???  Many of our customers are either virtualizing databases or planning to do so soon. I hear from many groups that attempted running their database on VMware but went back to physical hardware because of performance issues. There are many reasons this may have happened, but quite often the decision to go back to physical was not based on hard facts. This presentation will explore the fundamentals of monitoring databases running in a VMware environment. If you are using classic O/S monitoring tools, you may be getting misleading data. Understand what metrics are important and how to get to that data.
