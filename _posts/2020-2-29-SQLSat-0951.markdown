## Title: Tally Ho! -- Explore the Varied Uses of Tally Tables
 
**Abstract**:
Because SQL Server is designed to efficiently operate with set-based queries it does not perform as well with loops and cursors. However there are situations where you really need some type of a loop. Tally tables give you the best of both worlds by allowing you to effectively "loop" through records in a set-based manner.  We'll explore what tally tables are, how they work, and more importantly review some of the many ways you can use them to turn your loops and cursors into efficient set-based operations.

## Title: Revenge: The SQL!
 
**Abstract**:
Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.

## Title: That's So Metadata: Discover Your Database From The Inside
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever needed to learn a new database design and don't know where to begin? Or are trying to find out why a query doesn't perform well?  Or need to provide security information to auditors or your security team?

SQL Server has numerous metadata facilities available to help you with these tasks and more. Functions, dynamic management views, and system stored procedures can illuminate details from a single column up through an entire SQL Server instance. We will demonstrate metadata techniques to help you:

- Document your database schema objects such as procedures, functions, tables, columns and indexes
- Investigate performance and look for bottlenecks and tuning opportunities
- Discover metadata to administer your databases backups, index maintenance, and security
- Apply your own metadata using extended properties

We will also cover the official Microsoft documentation on these features and other resources on how to use them.

## Title: Azure Cost Management
 
**Abstract**:
One of the benefits of the cloud is the ability to be able to create resources quickly and on-demand as you need them. However, without proper control and monitoring, this can quickly generate some not-so-pleasant surprises when your bill arrives. In this session, I want to show you how you can create governance around your Azure environment to avoid these surprises and start getting the most from your spend while still being able to maintain the flexibility that makes the cloud so valuable. We will discuss how you can allocate costs to specific areas and create more accountability in your organization using things such as tagging. We will also dive heavily into the Azure Cost Management + Billing portion of the portal and talk about analyzing spends and how you can create more visibility to your organization. We will also look at creating and using budgets, alerting around billing\spends, and how to review and interpret the cost saving recommendations that Azure provides.

## Title: Data Virtualization with PolyBase
 
**Abstract**:
PolyBase is Microsoft's data virtualization technology, allowing you to integrate SQL Server with external systems such as Hadoop and Azure Blob Storage.  As of SQL Server 2019, PolyBase also allows you to connect to diverse systems such as Oracle, MongoDB, Cosmos DB, Teradata, Apache Spark, and even other SQL Server instances.  In this talk, we will walk through the mechanics of PolyBase, showing how we can write T-SQL queries to access data from heterogeneous sources.  We will investigate the Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) and other resources needed to tease out what the PolyBase engine is doing behind the scenes and where to go when things break down.  Finally, we will look at several interesting use cases for PolyBase in the modern data environment.

## Title: Getting Started: Introduction to Azure SQL Database
 
**Abstract**:
First impressions have long-lasting effects. When dealing with an architecture change like migrating to Azure SQL Database the last thing you want to do is have a bad first impression. In this session, you will learn the difference between Azure SQL Database, Elastic Pools, Managed Instances, and Hyperscale.  You will learn how to test migrations for compatibility issues before you start your migration process. You will learn how to secure your data and also make your data highly available. Finally, you will learn how to determine which performance tier is a good starting point for your existing workload(s) and how to monitor your workload over time to make sure your users have a great experience while you save as much money as possible.

## Title: “The different faces of Information: Data Modeling and the Data Profession in the 21st Century”
 
**Abstract**:
One Data Model fit all cases is not possible- When the only tool you have is a hammer all the problems look like a nail.
From Flat File to Big Data different models have been used each with their own advantage and limitations. Depending on the purpose our models change and change the skills and tools we use.
From manual processing to the digital collection, storage, manipulation, and analysis of data our models have been changed and enriched in order to make sense of the information inside the data, convert it to knowledge and finally gain wisdom in our decisions.
The presentation is an overview of the way we work today with data and how the new perspectives on Data are changing the data profession. In addition to the traditional and new models to work with data, the author introduces two models of his own to explain the “Digital Transformation Hierarchy” and “The Intelligence Life Cycle”.

## Title: The Power of Power BI Themes or I Haven't Written Themes Since High School
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI uses themes to customize the look of Power BI reports. I hope most of you already know how to change colors and fonts in your BI reports. But if you are doing that for every data visualization on every page/tab, you are: 1) wasting a lot of time configuring these same properties multiple times, and 2) risking inconsistent styles (colors and fonts) because it is so easy to miss one or more of the format settings as you go from one data visualization on one page to another. But what if you could define your format settings one time and use them across all your pages, even in multiple BI files created by yourself and others in your organization creating a consistency or branding that would be difficult to achieve manually. This session explores how you can build and use themes to accomplish such a task. It consists mostly of demonstrations with an introduction into basic JSON which sounds scarily like coding but don't worry, I'll guide you through the rough waters.

## Title: Replace Hundreds of Fragmented SSRS Reports with Integrated Dashboards in Weeks
 
**Abstract**:
Has your organization accumulated a ton of reports that are crucial, yet fragmented and difficult to maintain? This session deals with the challenge of documenting those disconnected reports and replacing them with integrated dashboards. We will also discuss the trade offs of different data integration architecture options such as data lakes, dimensional models, real time solutions like data virtualization, and cloud based solutions. 

In this session, we will explore:
- Different industry solutions to document your existing SSRS reports and SSAS cubes to identify all the columns used in source tables/objects.
- Interrogating the database objects (views, stored  procedures, etc.) to decipher the ETL mappings and transformations and present this in a human readable format of data lineage with business rules applied to the source system.
- Grouping these reports into sets to be consolidated in a few dashboard
- Different solutions to accommodate the desired data integration architecture

## Title: An Introduction to Spatial Data in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Over a decade ago Microsoft added the capability to store and work with geometry and geography data types. (Wait...what's this you say?!?) Well, yes...it's been there for quite some time now. You can actually store spatial data in SQL tables (in the form of points, lines and polygons). There are also many powerful, built-in functions that allow the manipulation and calculation of results around this data. This is a powerful, but sadly underused feature of the product given that IoT tends to be so focused around the location of things. 

Come to this session to learn about: 

● The two elusive data types (geography and geometry) 
● T-SQL Spatial routines and functions 
● How to load spatial data 
● Where you can get lots and lots of free spatial data to supplement your existing systems 
● See an example of real-world Spatial data in use (aggregating truck positions for tax calcs) 
● Write a SQL query from a bitmap picture (pure amusement)

## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source
 
**Abstract**:
Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. quot;Virtualize Firstquot; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too quot;criticalquot; to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments.

## Title: From Tech to Lead - Transitioning from a Technician to a Leader
 
**Abstract**:
Many people want to be a manager; however, most folks believe that their company will guide them or provide the opportunity for that next big step.  That is not the case!   You have to take your career into your own hands, take additional responsibilities, be more vocal, add more skills, and discuss your career desires with your supervisor and HR.

You got the manager role, now what?  The transition from a team member to a manager can be a rough road.  Just because you’re the manager now, doesn’t mean people will listen to you.  Understanding what it takes to become a Leader, not a manager, will be the difference between success and failure!


This presentation will share some successful practices on how to successfully transition from Technician to a Leader.

## Title: Performance Improvements in SQL Server 2019
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft released SQL Server 2019 in November.  The latest version contains several improvements and new features that improve reliability and performance.  First, Accelerated Database Recovery (ADR) completely redesigns the SQL Server database engine recovery process.  This allows the time spent recovering from a crash or rolling back a transaction to be greatly reduced.  ADR also prevents the transaction log from growing during a long-running transaction.  Second, metadata for temporary tables can be stored in in-memory tables.  For tempdb-heavy workloads, this removes a bottleneck and provides an improvement to performance.  Finally, SQL Server 2019 supports the use of persistent-memory (PMEM) devices.  PMEM can be used to persist the transaction log buffer, effectively removing LOGWRITE waits.  Join me for this session to learn about these new features in SQL Server 2019 and how they can make your workload run faster.

## Title: How To Give a Technical Presentation
 
**Abstract**:
Most people don't like to speak in public and technical folks are certainly no exception.  Yet, you've got some ideas for a great presentation but just don't know how to go about putting it all together.  On top of that, how do you go about giving the presentation itself?  This session will cover how to pull your material together in an organized fashion and present it such that your audience can follow along and get the message you want to relay.  We'll also discuss how to deal with issues that cause presenters stress to help you to make the process enjoyable and rewarding for all.

## Title: Using Powershell to Document SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Most DBAs use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects. Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exported because they live at the server level, above the database. Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for Disaster Recovery purposes. Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, Server Triggers and much more

## Title: Performance Tuning - Analyzing Execution Plans
 
**Abstract**:
Did you ever get woken up at night from a call from a user screaming about poor query performance, but didn’t really know how to begin attack the problem?  In this session, we will explore the basics of execution plan analysis and how to single out issues that pertain to base table operations.
In this presentation, we will identify what indexes are being used by the SQL Optimizer, the different type of index operations that are performed by SQL Server and which operations are generally considered the preferred method of data retrieval. We will discuss how to determine if the indexes used by the Optimizer are optimal, according to best practices, and the exceptions to those cases.   Finally, we will cover the relationships between different types of index operations and joins within SQL Server, including how the SQL Optimizer determines which join type it will use, along with the pros and cons of each join operation

## Title: Deploying Database Changes Without Taking an Outage
 
**Abstract**:
For most DBA's and most companies changes to the database are done during either a maintenance window that allows some downtime or during a full planned outage. Doing it that way makes a lot of sense, you don't have to work about blocking or deadlocks or the code being out of sync with the database. But what if your business needs to move faster, say deploying changes every week? It's possible, with some caveats and a small risk or two! This presentation will start an overview of "blue/green" deployments and why "database first" is a good plan. From there we'll look at how to deploy various types of changes and how to assess and mitigate the risk of each. It is possible, and the upside if that you'll work fewer nights and weekends making changes!

**Abstract**:
PowerBI is Microsoft's self service reporting tool that give businesses a robust visualization of their data. As Microsoft's Power Platform has evolved, PowerApps is taking a similar approach by providing businesses with a self service application tier. In this session we will see the power of bringing the two together. Let's explore how the visualization tier of PowerBI can enhance the development and capabilities of PowerApps.  We will go from a blank canvas app and import visualizations while pointing out some of the pros and cons of marrying the two together. We will use the capabilities of PowerApps to write and update our SQL Server tables. Bringing the two together can provide businesses with a robust solution under one umbrella. Join me in learning how these two services came together and said "I DO".

## Title: 5 Availability Groups Issues That May Ruin Your Day
 
**Abstract**:
AlwaysOn Availability Groups have become the most common High Availability technology used with SQL Server. It provides protection at the database group level, and it stores a separate copy of each database on each node, eliminating storage from being a single point of failure.

While Availability Groups help to achieve required High Availability, they may also introduce issues in the system. In this session, Dmitri will discuss several less-known problems associated with them. You will learn how Availability Groups may impact transaction log truncation and contribute to the blocking in the system, how readable secondaries may increase CPU and I/O load on primaries among a few other things. Dmitri will also discuss how to properly setup monitoring for Availability Group infrastructure in your environment.

## Title: CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming
 
**Abstract**:
This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.

Data Warehousing has been traditionally deployed via on-prem MPP solutions, and due to cloud modernization, and datacenter reduction footprint initiatives, organizations are looking out to establish a relationship with a cloud solution that can help them get off the traditional storage and compute licensing scheme, to easily scale their workloads without spending millions in newly acquired hardware, and to reduce their database administration operational tasks. 
Azure Synapse Analytics, Google BigQuery and Snowflake Provide a path to migrate workloads into the cloud and allows an efficient resource utilization for both compute and storage. That is at least, what the marketing says as it has a tacit disclaimer around it. 
Azure Synapse Analytics offers scalability, pay-as-you-go compute solutions, with data contained within the database boundaries. 
The presentation shows a side by side comparison, with pros and cons of each platform and debunks some of the myths that have surfaced.

## Title: Turn Runbooks into Notebooks: Handling Maintenance and Emergencies with Azure Data Studio
 
**Abstract**:
On-call DBAs have all had that phone call in the middle of the night: "the database is down, fix it now!" We start scrambling to piece together various scripts to analyze the emergency, mitigate the issues, and kick off a failover or similar fix to make the database happy and healthy once again. Even scheduled maintenance likely requires us to download scripts from a ticket, run the scripts, and screenshot the results for documentation. What if I told you that Azure Data Studio's notebooks allow you to execute T-SQL and PowerShell together to handle these processes from a single document that documents its own results and can be stored directly in source control? Join me in this demo-heavy session to see how we can handle real-world on-call situations using Azure Data Studio notebooks.
